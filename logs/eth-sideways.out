The researcher noted that although the current limit of 32 ETH allows more validators to join the Ethereum network, making it more decentralized, it also leads to an inflation of the validator set size.\n\nNeuder added that such a large increase would ultimately help the Ethereum network become more efficient over time. Besides the proposal to increase the minimum required staked ETH for validators, Neuder also called for auto-compounding validator rewards.\n\nEthereum consensus layer meeting.

Currently, to produce any staking income, rewards received in excess of the 32 ETH cap must be transferred to another account. These benefits could be rapidly compounded if the cap were raised, giving validators a practical way to increase their earn reward.\n\nNeuder claimed the current proposal would not only make the Ethereum network more efficient and make way for validators to earn more money, but it would also help large node operators, such as exchanges, which currently manage thousands of validators.\n\nRelated: Hong Kong legislator invites Coinbase to the region despite SEC scrutiny\n\nThe 32 ETH limit has led to a significant surge in validator addresses after Ethereum‚Äôs transition to a proof-of-stake network.

The current limit of 32 ether (ETH) per validator could potentially be raised to 2,048 ETH.\n\nThis proposed change aims to enhance the efficiency of the Ethereum network while maintaining decentralization. Let‚Äôs delve into the details of this proposal and its potential implications.\n\nPresently, Ethereum validators face an effective balance cap, which restricts them to a minimum and maximum stake of 32 ETH. This limitation forces large-scale staking operations to create multiple validators in order to earn yield on amounts exceeding this threshold. Consequently, there has been a surge in the number of validators, with approximately 600,000 active validators and an additional 90,000 waiting to be activated in the queue.\n\nDuring a recent Ethereum core developer consensus meeting, Michael Neuder, an Ethereum Foundation researcher and a prominent advocate of the proposed change, put forth a compelling argument in favor of raising the validator cap. Neuder highlighted that while the current cap promotes decentralization, it inadvertently leads to an inflationary growth of the validator set size.\n\nOne of the key benefits of raising the validator cap is the potential to improve the network‚Äôs efficiency in achieving finality within a single Ethereum slot. By slowing down the expansion of the active validator set, this change would enable more effective utilization of resources and enhance the overall performance of the network.\n\nAnother significant advantage that the proposed increased cap brings is the possibility of auto-compounding validator rewards. Currently, any rewards earned beyond the 32 ETH cap must be directed elsewhere to generate staking yield. However, if the cap is lifted, validators would have the opportunity to immediately compound these rewards, thereby maximizing their earnings from staked ETH.\n\nThe proposal also addresses operational concerns faced by larger node operators, including exchanges like Coinbase and defi protocols such as Lido. These operators currently maintain tens of thousands of validators due to the existing 32 ETH cap per validator. By raising the maximum effective validator balance, they would be able to manage fewer but higher-stake validators, reducing complexity and streamlining their operations.\n\nWhile the proposed change offers several advantages, it is crucial to consider the associated risks. With a higher validator balance, there is a potential increase in penalties for accidental double attestations or proposals, commonly known as ‚Äúslashing.‚Äù It is essential to carefully evaluate and mitigate these risks to ensure the smooth functioning of the Ethereum network.\n\nAlso Read: Ethscriptions a new NFT Protocol live on ETH Blockchain\n\nThe proposal is currently under debate among the core developers, who have agreed to continue discussing its implementation details on social platforms such as ETHMagicians and Discord. This open dialogue allows for a comprehensive evaluation of the proposal‚Äôs impact and the incorporation of valuable insights from the Ethereum community.'}]

So they‚Äôre essentially the same.\n\nIf Ethereum went back down to its prior low, that would get it back home. And we talked about this a year ago. I said, ‚ÄòLook guys, what I think is going to happen is we either go down to the regression band or we go sideways until it catches up.‚Äô Now, if we were to dump now, if we were to dump to what I‚Äôve called home before, it would actually correspond to the prior low.‚Äù\n\nIn a worst-case scenario, Cowen says that ETH could briefly trade below the logarithmic regression trendline, similar to what happened in March 2020.\n\n‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt mean that you can‚Äôt go below that level. As you can see, we did go entirely below the entire regression band back in March 2020. And in fact, it went about 34% below the regression band during that drop.\n\nIf we were to have another drop, similar to that, like 34% below this level, that would correspond down to about a $400 Ethereum, which is why I‚Äôve thrown that number out there in the past as a potential outcome in a worst-case scenario environment.‚Äù\n\nEthereum is trading for $1,736 at time of writing, a fractional increase in the last 24 hours.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat ‚Äì Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

While many solutions are already connecting the numerous chains, they don‚Äôt come without risks.\n\nDifferent layer-1 blockchains aim to solve this interoperability problem by creating a network with integrated bridges between chains and asynchronous message passing. Using a cross-chain bridge, it‚Äôs possible to move value from one chain to another. However, this raises several issues for developers and users. One major issue is the potential for bridge hacks, which have caused billions of dollars in damage in recent years.\n\nIn addition, a fragmented blockchain landscape leads to inefficiencies and complexity, exposing additional vulnerabilities. Trading across chains can be costly with rising gas prices and slippage risks. What‚Äôs more, bridging solutions can take anywhere from minutes to hours to get a transaction through.\n\nAttacks on bridges account for 69% of total funds stolen in 2022. Source: Chainalysis\n\nOne blockchain to connect them all\n\nZetaChain, a decentralized layer-1 chain, compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), aims to make the blockchain industry more interoperable by natively supporting cross-chain bridging of assets, data and liquidity.\n\nZetaChain‚Äôs approach makes it possible to build omnichain decentralized applications (DApps) that allow users to access all of their assets and data from a single platform, regardless of the blockchain they were created or stored on. The increased interoperability and ability to create omnichain DApps could improve user experience, which could, in turn, benefit the adoption of blockchain technology in general.\n\nFurthermore, ZetaChain not only supports smart contract chains like Ethereum but can also integrate non-smart contract blockchains like Dogecoin and Bitcoin using the cross-chain toolkit for developers. The network effectively allows for Bitcoin smart contracts giving developers the tools and infrastructure to merge their BRC-20 projects, for example. Overall, however, the network is blockchain agnostic.\n\nSource: ZetaChain\n\nGaining momentum\n\nZetaChain is a new project and therefore is working hard to gain a foothold within the crypto industry. The project recently published its white paper, available in 17 different languages. The document highlights the focus on interoperability between chains and developers worldwide.\n\nThe blockchain‚Äôs testnet has attracted more than 1.5 million users from over 100 countries while its community continues to grow. In addition, ZetaChain‚Äôs social media channels have built a follower base of over 1.7 million people in the short time they have been live.\n\nOn the developer side, the momentum is visible as well. The project has partnered with many big names in the crypto industry, including an infrastructure provider for the BNB Chain ecosystem Ankr, blockchain security company Halborn, and bug bounty and security services platform Immunefi. DApp development ranges from decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to NFTs and universal and private identity platforms, all to expand the reach of the ecosystem.\n\nDevelopers interested in building DApps on top of ZetaChain can apply for funding through the ZetaChain Grants Program. Hundreds of developer teams have already applied for this funding, hoping to receive a kick-start from the project.\n\nüì¢ Announcing $5 million in ZetaChain grants to power the next generation of Omnichain dApps. Learn about the program and apply here:https://t.co/ISA1vorcbP ‚Äî ZetaChain (@zetablockchain) April 13, 2023\n\nNot stealing from other chains, but growing with them\n\nA key aspect of ZetaChain‚Äôs mission is to grow with other networks rather than at their expense. Brandon Truong, chief product officer at ZetaChain, emphasized this aspect: ‚ÄúZetaChain is in a unique position as a new L1 that connects other chains agnostically. Instead of trying to steal liquidity and users from other ecosystems and chains, it can grow with them. The growth of ZetaChain goes hand in hand with the growth of crypto in general.‚Äù\n\nThe project‚Äôs founders began their journey by exploring the different types of architecture that exist to connect other chains. They quickly discovered many issues, from the aforementioned vulnerabilities to async messaging-based and centralized approaches. By developing an EVM-compatible layer-1 blockchain, ZetaChain aims to be a solution that works for users and developers while keeping security concerns in mind.\n\nZetaChain empowers developers to create easy-to-use DApps that onboard non-crypto natives to the crypto space. Moreover, the network allows developers to create DApps that are cross-chain by default and take out the unnecessary burden of reworking code to make a product work on several chains.

A recent tweet published by the Santiment analytics team hints at the reasons that have suddenly pushed ETH up.\n\nEthereum jumps 5.93%: reasons behind it\n\nThe main reason, per Santiment, for the Ethereum price surge is that it has been following the growth of Bitcoin, just like the rest of the crypto market. The flagship cryptocurrency recaptured the $28,000 level (surging by 7.71% within 24 hours) after the news of main Wall Street companies ‚Äî Fidelity, Charles Schwab and Citadel Securities ‚Äî launching a crypto exchange dubbed EDX.\n\nüìà Powered by #Bitcoin's jump back above $28.8k & #Ethereum's return above $1,820, price pumps are being seen market-wide.

Prior to that, the world's largest wealth manager, BlackRock, announced that it filed for a Bitcoin spot ETF, with rumors about Fidelity having similar plans following almost immediately.\n\nBesides, as reported by U.Today earlier, global wealth management company Invesco also filed for a spot BTC exchange-traded fund, according to a recently published SEC document.\n\nAside from the new Wall Street-backed exchange, a lot of dormant BTC whales have begun moving their Bitcoins back into the market, according to another tweet by Santiment.\n\nSantiment also stated that Ethereum was pushed up not only by Bitcoin but also by a massive surge in trading volume on the crypto market ‚Äî $222 billion last week, which was 30% more than the week before that seen.\n\nWall Street enters crypto, while SEC sues major exchanges\n\nLast week, the crypto market experienced a wave of shock as the SEC filed charges against the two largest crypto exchanges in the U.S., Binance and Coinbase. The regulator claimed that these platforms violated U.S. securities laws.\n\nThis happened after SEC first sued Ripple Labs in late 2020 and has recently been clamping down on various crypto platforms, including, again, Coinbase (when it forbade them to launch a crypto lending service last year) and Kraken.\n\nHowever, at the same time, large Wall Street companies are entering the crypto space as was mentioned above, including the largest bank in Germany, Deutsche Bank, now seeking a license to start offering crypto custodial services to its clients.\n\nSome thought leaders in crypto believe that the SEC is sweeping out major crypto companies from the U.S., so that Wall Street giants can take their place and grab up their income. However, many Bitcoin maxis believe that Wall Street entering crypto is a great sign for Bitcoin adoption and for BTC's future."}, {'id': 9, 'time': 'Wed, 21 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Has Ties to SEC Darling Prometheum‚ÄîHere's How - Yahoo Finance", 'content': "The connection between Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Wanxiang Blockchain Labs, although it‚Äôs been public for years, is suddenly a very big deal.

Upheld by Gary Gensler as an example of how regulatory compliance for crypto companies is indeed possible, the firms' connection to Shanghai Wanxiang Blockchain drew scrutiny.\n\nWanxiang Blockchain Labs is a non-profit organization and China-based research institution started in 2015 by China Wanxiang Holding. The Labs‚Äô resources were integrated into Shanghai Wanxiang Blockchain, a firm established in 2017.\n\nWhy Vitalik Buterin is Known as the 'V God' in China\n\nButerin‚Äôs connection to the nonprofit can be traced back to Ethereum‚Äôs early days. In 2015, then-CEO of Wanxiang Blockchain Labs Feng Xiao formed a relationship with Buterin and purchased $500,000 worth of Ethereum. The funds helped Buterin pay developers, according to a report from Global Coin Research.\n\nStory continues\n\nButerin was one of several guest speakers at Blockchain Week 2016, a conference co-hosted by the Ethereum Foundation and Wanxiang Blockchain Labs, which also featured talks from Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire and Ripple Labs co-founder Jed McCaleb, according to the event‚Äôs website.\n\nAt the time Buterin was described on the event‚Äôs website as Wanxiang Blockchain Labs‚Äôs chief scientist. That assertion is backed by a description of Buterin‚Äôs role on the non-profits‚Äô website now.

This cryptocurrency and blockchain is a market leader, attracting developers and users to its platform -- and investors to buy and stake coins.\n\nBut the past year hasn\'t been easy for cryptocurrency in general. The market\'s value tumbled last year. Amid economic woes, people turned away from cryptocurrency and favored the safest investments. This year, the crypto market has been on the rise -- but it\'s slipped from its 2023 peak reached in April. Could this hold back Ethereum? Or could this market leader become a trillion-dollar cryptocurrency by 2024? Let\'s find out.\n\nDevelopers love Ethereum\n\nIf you ask developers which blockchain they\'re building on, many of them would say Ethereum. In fact, the blockchain has the most total developers of any other player, according to the latest Electric Capital developer report. And the number has increased 52% from two years ago to more than 5,800.\n\nWinning over developers is key because they are the ones building content -- and that, in turn, adds to the use cases for a particular blockchain.\n\nAnd that\'s part of why Ethereum also is a leader when it comes to hosting decentralized applications (dApps). This big player is No. 1 in the sales of non-fungible tokens, too, CryptoSlam data show.\n\nStill, people have had one complaint about Ethereum since its early days. That\'s its slow transaction speed and the costs associated with this. But the good news is Ethereum is working on this problem, and thanks to a series of planned updates, the blockchain should become much faster and cheaper down the road.\n\nEthereum has already started that process. An update last year helped the blockchain reduce its energy consumption by 99%. That\'s as it switched to the proof-of-stake validation method from proof of work. While proof of work relies on intense computational power to validate blocks of data, proof of stake doesn\'t. Instead, it grants the right to validate to those holding a significant stake.\n\nThe role of rollups\n\nEthereum also is scaling up by using a layer 2 solution known as a rollup. Rollups involve handling transactions in batches and then sending output back to the mainnet. Already, rollups are as much as eight times cheaper than using the mainnet -- and in the future, fees could become at least 40 times cheaper.\n\nThe blockchain also is working on improving security and even "future proofing" the system. For example, eventually quantum computing may represent a risk for the cryptography used to secure Ethereum today. Even though the threat probably is far down the road, right now Ethereum is exploring two forms of quantum-safe cryptography.\n\nAll of this means the Ethereum of tomorrow is likely to be even better than the Ethereum of today. Now, let\'s consider whether that could push Ethereum from its $208 billion market value of today into trillion-dollar territory. If we use today\'s circulating supply of Ethereum -- about 120 million coins -- we can see that to reach a market value of $1 trillion, Ethereum would have to more than quadruple from today\'s price.\n\nThe economic backdrop\n\nAgainst a strong economic backdrop, that could happen rather quickly. But I\'m not convinced we\'re there yet. The Federal Reserve is modeling for a recession later this year. Even though it\'s expected to be mild, this still could weigh on demand for crypto. Ethereum has increased more than 40% this year. And it still may continue to climb -- but it may not do so at a pace that will catapult it to $1 trillion in value by next year.\n\nThat said, this isn\'t bad news. Ethereum\'s outlook remains bright. And planned upgrades should help the network excel over the long term. And that\'s great news for investors who buy this leading cryptocurrency now.'}, {'id': 6, 'time': 'Wed, 21 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "3 reasons why Ethereum's market cap dominance is on the rise - Cointelegraph", 'content': 'Ethereum has been the dominant smart contract and decentralized application (DApp) network since its inception.

Excluding Bitcoin (BTC) from the analysis, Ether‚Äôs market share presently stands at 40.6%, while its next competitor, BNB (BNB), holds a 7.2% share.\n\nThe disparity between Ethereum and others is also evident when analyzing the total value locked (TVL) on each network‚Äôs smart contracts.

This data shows the irrelevance of the total number of unique active wallets (UAW) interacting with smart contracts per chain.\n\nFor instance, according to DappRadar, WAX has 363,600 active users, followed by BNB Chain‚Äôs 517,300 30-day UAW. These figures are way higher than the Ethereum network‚Äôs 66,300 unique active addresses, but they reflect much lower transaction fee, opening room for manipulation.\n\nDecentralization matters, and Ethereum stands out among its competitors\n\nThe Ethereum ecosystem has the highest number of active developers, surpassing 1,870, which is more than the next three competitors ‚Äî Polkadot (752), Cosmos (511) and Solana (383) ‚Äî combined.\n\nCurrently, the Ethereum network has over 700,000 validators, with 99% of the balances locked in staking participating in the process. The 32 ETH threshold limit per validator undoubtedly inflates this number, but Lido, the largest known staking pool, controls 32% of the staking, with Coinbase coming in second with 9.6%.\n\nConsequently, it is safe to say that Ethereum is far less centralized in terms of development and validation compared with Tron, BNB Chain and Solana.\n\nOther reasons Ether‚Äôs dominance has been on the rise, even as Bitcoin reached a 50% market share on June 19, include derivatives activity and its dominance of the NFT market\n\nDerivatives markets are essential to institutional investors\n\nEther‚Äôs future contracts are essential for institutional trading practices like hedging and trading with leverage. Ether‚Äôs cash-settled futures were added to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in February 2021. To date, no other cryptocurrency, apart from Bitcoin, has reached the world‚Äôs largest derivatives exchange.\n\nIn futures markets, longs and shorts are balanced at all times, but having a larger number of active contracts ‚Äî open interest ‚Äî allows the participation of institutional investors who require a minimum market size. Ether futures aggregated open interest stands at $5.4 billion, while competitor BNB hold $380 million and Solana a mere $178 million.\n\nEthereum is still the market leader in NFTs\n\nNonfungible tokens are a perfect example of how cheaper, faster transactions do not always translate to increased adoption. Nothing is stopping NFT projects from shifting between blockchains, whether for new listings or existing collections. In fact, y00ts and DeGods moved to Polygon earlier in 2023.\n\nDespite facing gas fees that often break above $10, Ethereum remains the absolute leader in the number of buyers and total sales. According to CryptoSlam, the leading network reached $380 million in sales over the past 30 days, while Solana, Polygon and BNB Chain totaled a combined $93 million.\n\nUltimately, the data favors Ethereum versus its competing smart contract-focused blockchains. The positive trend in Ether‚Äôs dominance might fade over time if the promised network upgrade to allow parallel processing (sharding) does not come to fruition, but for now, Ether‚Äôs 20% market capitalization share remains unchallenged.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Discover SCENE\n\nVolition, a new StarkWare product for the permissionless Starknet network, promises to drastically reduce Ethereum transaction fees, to the point where the network can support micropayments similar to Bitcoin\'s Lightning Network.\n\nSet to go live with Starknet v0.13.0 later this year, Volition will "remove the big barrier to microtransactions,‚Äù StarkWare CEO Uri Kolodny told Decrypt. ‚ÄúIt will finally make the crypto for coffee transactions viable," he said, adding that, "This will be very important for crypto adoption. It will have particular advantages in developing economies.‚Äù\n\nEthereum fees, also known as gas fees, have been a concern for users of the Ethereum network for some time. Despite the network\'s recent major upgrades, the fees can still be often high, resulting in more challenges for users, particularly those who engage in frequent transactions or use decentralized applications (dapps).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs data from Bitinfocharts shows, Ethereum\'s average transaction fee, which measures the average fee when a transaction is processed and confirmed, was around $4.80 on June 22‚Äîsignificantly lower than at this year‚Äôs peak of more than $27 recorded just last month. But while that\'s considered reasonable for transactions involving larger amounts, it still represents a major roadblock to mainstream adoption of Ethereum.\n\nAside from the proverbial crypto for coffee, Volition\'s developers argue that it opens up a host of other use cases previously not possible in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThese include on-chain voting governance applications that would enable decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to vote cheaply, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), or buying in-game assets.\n\n‚ÄúVolition will make on-chain voting so much more accessible by radically reducing its cost. People missing voting because of high fees‚Äîcurrently common in blockchain‚Äîwill become a thing of the past,‚Äù said Kolodny.\n\nFor on-chain gaming, the StarkWare CEO says the new scaling solution ‚Äúsuddenly sets designers free to give a more immersive experience.‚Äù\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs because you want to offer players all sorts of different assets at different price-points, some of them very cheap," Kolodny told Decrypt. "Today, a five cent asset incurs several dollars in fees; with Volition it becomes viable. Volition will set gaming free,‚Äù he said.\n\nSeparating data availability\n\nOn a technical level, Starknet is a decentralized, permissionless Validity Rollup that operates as a Layer-2 network built on top of Ethereum. It provides an opportunity for any decentralized app (dapp) to significantly enhance its computational scalability without compromising the security features of the Ethereum network. By utilizing Starknet, dapps can achieve increased scale for their computations while leveraging the robustness and security provided by Ethereum\'s underlying infrastructure.\n\nHowever, with the introduction of Volition, developers gain the ability to optimize the transaction process by selecting the data availability mode for each individual storage variable. This is achieved by implementing Starknet\'s state as two separate storage commitment trees: one for Layer-1 data availability mode, which refers to data being available on the Ethereum mainnet, and one for Layer-2 data availability mode, indicating data availability on the Starknet Layer-2.\n\nData availability on a blockchain refers to the accessibility and persistence of the stored data. In a blockchain, data is typically organized into blocks, which are linked together using cryptographic hashes to form a chain. Each block contains a set of transactions or other types of data.\n\nVolition enables developers and users to choose the data availability mode for each contract. Image: StarkWare\n\nIn public networks, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, all information is stored on every node, meaning that users end up paying for the burden this puts on every block forever as everything you do is saved forever whether you need it or not.\n\nVolition claims to give users the flexibility to store the data in a place where it‚Äôs still very accessible, but is distributed less widely. In other words, it implies the option of saving cost by storing data on Layer-2 instead of Layer-1 in instances where high expenditure on data availability isn‚Äôt merited economically.\n\nData availability matters because it allows users to calculate the state of the chain by themselves, enabling them to continue transacting with their assets even if other nodes in the system stop cooperating.\n\nAs explained by StarkWare, the default today is that users always pay for L-1 data availability‚Äîwhich, in turn, bloats transaction fees for small-value transactions. That‚Äôs why Volition pushing the data for these transactions to Layer-2 paves the way to micro-transactions: the functionality enables developers‚Äîand eventually u...'}]

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain, news, and reflection analyst reports, it is clear that the market trend for ETH is currently uncertain with mixed signals. The on-chain analysis indicates a potential bearish outlook in the near future, with the MACD signal shifting from buy to sell. On the other hand, the news analysis suggests a positive short-term trend for Ethereum, driven by price surges, market dominance, and positive external factors. The reflection report emphasizes the importance of a balanced and cautious approach in navigating the volatile market conditions for ETH.

Considering the mixed signals and uncertainties in the market, it is advisable to adopt a long-term strategy focused on risk management rather than short-term gains. By closely monitoring market trends, news developments, and technical indicators, traders can make informed decisions to maximize profitability over the long term.

Given the current market conditions and the need for a conservative approach, I would take a neutral trading action with a confidence level of 0.0. This reflects a balanced stance, prioritizing risk management and strategic decision-making in the face of uncertainty in the ETH market.

Its flagship Bitcoin vault allows users to store the cryptocurrency using up to five keys for more distributed security.\n\nCasa‚Äôs service originally catered to Bitcoin ‚Äúwhales‚Äù willing to spend $10,000 a year on custody before opening its service to a broader base of users. The company has now added an Ether vault to its platform, with ETH holders also able to use up to five keys to secure their holdings.\n\nAccording to Casa CEO Nick Neuman, with Bitcoin and Ethereum operating as entirely different protocols, the industry had not yet built a security solution that accommodates both on the same platform, aside from various hardware wallet models.\n\nThe firm is also engaging with users over the potential of adding self-custody support for various ETH-related assets, including nonfungible tokens, stablecoins and ERC-20 tokens.\n\nAs Cointelegraph previously reported, Casa co-founder and chief technical officer Jameson Lopp highlighted increasing calls for a multisignature ETH self-custody from its users and the wider cryptocurrency community.\n\nCasa announced its intent to launch an ETH storage solution amid several high-profile collapses of custodians like FTX, as many users not only lost access to ETH, but also to their Ethereum-based stablecoins and other ERC tokens.\n\nRelated: Ledger CEO says crypto key recovery service makes self-custody easier\n\nHackers also wrought havoc within the Web3 space in 2022, with billions of dollars stolen through decentralized finance bridge hacks and smart contract exploits. It‚Äôs a point Neuman highlighted when Casa announced its plans for ETH storage on its platform, with many hacks across the ‚ÄúWeb3/crypto space due to poor private key management.‚Äù\n\nIn an interview with Cointelegraph journalist Joe Hall, cypherpunk Jameson Lopp stressed the importance of making self-custody solutions more accessible and easier to give users complete control of their assets and peace of mind managing the associated responsibilities.\n\nIndustry experts have also suggested that its difficult to estimate the amount of BTC currently held in self-custody wallets.\n\nMagazine: Ordinals turned Bitcoin into a worse version of Ethereum: Can we fix it?'}, {'id': 5, 'time': 'Fri, 23 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum Rainbow chart sets ETH price for Jan 1, 2024 - Finbold - Finance in Bold', 'content': 'Although Ethereum (ETH) has been struggling to regain the psychological threshold of $2,000 despite the recent positive momentum on the wider cryptocurrency market, its outlook might not look as bearish by the year‚Äôs turn if BlockchainCenter‚Äôs rainbow price chart for Ethereum is any indicator.\n\nSpecifically, some crypto traders and investors use Ethereum‚Äôs rainbow chart to observe the historical movements of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization in relation to various moving averages (MAs) and find patterns that could help them make better investment decisions.\n\nAs it happens, this chart suggests that Ethereum is currently still in the ‚ÄòFire Sale‚Äô phase, indicated by the color purple, and ranges between $0 and $2,593, below the ‚ÄòUndervalued‚Äô blue zone between $2,593 and $3,668, as per data seen by Finbold on June 23.\n\nEthereum rainbow price chart. Source: BlockchainCenter\n\nProjection for January 1, 2024\n\nSpecifically, Ethereum has been stuck in the ‚ÄòFire Sale‚Äô area since early October 2022, which, judging by the previous behavior, it might get out of in a matter of weeks, as the same had happened in July 20202, when ETH moved into the ‚ÄòUndervalued‚Äô zone after a period of eight months in the ‚ÄòFire Sale.‚Äô\n\nFurther crunching the numbers, it took Ethereum 10 months to peak at the ‚ÄòBut have we *earned* it?‚Äô level at $4,336. If the same trend occurs this time around, it would mean that the crypto asset would end up in the same zone ‚Äì currently between $16,353 ‚Äì $23,742, by April 2024.\n\nIn other words, seven months from now, around January 1, 2024, Ethereum could be changing hands in the ‚ÄòStill cheap‚Äô price area on the rainbow chart, which currently stands between $5,290 and $7,705, taking into consideration the exact same pattern.\n\nBefore that action, Ethereum was in the ‚ÄòFire Sale‚Äô area only one time ‚Äì in October 2015 ‚Äì soaring to the ‚ÄòGo back to BTC?‚Äô price level four months later, followed by a subsequent drop to the ‚ÄòUndervalued‚Äô zone in January 2017, where it stuck around very shortly until moving up again and beyond the ‚ÄòMaximum Bubble Territory.‚Äô\n\nShould this pattern repeat itself instead, it would mean that Ethereum could skyrocket to the ‚ÄòGo back to BTC?‚Äô area in October 2023, at a price between $23,742 and $34,283, before dropping to the ‚ÄòUndervalued‚Äô zone at $2,593 and $3,668 once again in January 2024.\n\nAlternatively, another Ethereum Rainbow Chart tool developed by CoinCodex estimates that under the same scenario, the asset‚Äôs price would hover around $778 per token if ETH remained inside the ‚ÄòUndervalued‚Äô (or ‚ÄòBUY!‚Äô) zone in January 2024.\n\nEthereum rainbow price chart. Source: CoinCodex.com\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum was at press time changing hands at the price of $1,872.40, recording a decline of 1.31% on the day but still an increase of 12.48% across the previous week and a 3.21% gain on its monthly chart, as per the latest data.\n\nEthereum 30-day price chart.

The momentum is certainly there, and the resilience of the crypto market this year has been impressive. Snapping up some breakout cryptos right now can lead to some hefty gains if the trends continue.\n\nRegardless, there are still more long-term positive catalysts at play that can propel the crypto market. The upcoming Bitcoin (BTC-USD) halving and potential rate cuts are principal catalysts to keep in mind.

While stability issues have always been my top concern with Solana, their focus on fixing such issues this year makes me believe this is a great contender for cryptos that could 10x by 2025.\n\nSolana has a lot of potential to become a leader in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, as it offers low fees, scalability, and interoperability with other blockchains. It is capturing a lot of the non-fungible token market share from Ethereum, and once the project figures out its stability issues, I believe more developers are likely to migrate.\n\nStill, Ethereum remains the top dog, and fees are very low. Solana is much more cyclical and volatile and I only expect it to deliver substantial gains when the Ethereum network is congested.\n\nNervos Network (CKB)\n\nAn image of the blockchain, distributing digital crypto from a phone through the web to another tablet\n\nSource: elenabsl/Shutterstock\n\nNervos Network (CKB-USD) is an under-the-radar project with one very bullish catalyst this year. CKB will be undergoing a halving event sometime in November and we could see the price climb significantly from there.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite the lack of momentum here, I‚Äôm optimistic about this project. The multi-layered blockchain network provides a secure, scalable, and interoperable platform for the next generation of decentralized applications.\n\nNervos consists of two layers: the Common Knowledge Base (CKB), which is a public and permissionless proof-of-work blockchain that stores data and assets; and the Application Chain Layer (ACL), which is a set of layer-2 solutions that enable fast and low-cost transactions. Simply put, it can combine the best aspects of both Ethereum and Bitcoin.\n\nThat said, I believe a lot of patience is needed here. That primarily concerns the lack of marketing. But as blockchain development continues to advance, the flexibility and interoperability offered by this project will make it very appealing.\n\nNervos Network is currently trading with a market cap of over $120 million and that leaves a lot of room for upside.\n\nStorj (STORJ)\n\nAn image of a hand holding a cell phone with several visualizations of digital building blocks floating above it. representing sto platforms\n\nSource: Marko Aliaksandr/ShutterStock.com\n\nStorj (STORJ-USD) is similar to Filecoin (FIL-USD), as it buys data storage from individuals worldwide with its STORJ token and then resells it in bulk to others. This project is overshadowed by the Filecoin project, and especially after the launch of FWS, many wonder why they should buy STORJ.\n\nThe answer here is tokenomics. Unlike Filecoin‚Äôs inflationary model (94% supply inflation), Storj does a great job of providing long-term value. The supply inflation here is at just 1% and your holdings won‚Äôt be eroded over time while enjoying the tailwinds from the decentralized cloud storage market.\n\nOf course, blockchain cloud storage has a long way to go. But both Filecoin and Storj have better pricing than their traditional counterparts and their customers enjoy the perks of no censorship, decentralization, and better stability.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

An interface and registry for smart contract accounts owned by ERC 721 tokens," was launched on May 7, 2023.\n\nERC 6551 is a standard of Ethereum (ETH) non-fungible tokens that can act as noncustodial wallets of Ethereum (ETH) accounts;\n\nERC 6551 allows every ERC 721 token to achieve all the functionalities of a cryptocurrency wallet: sending/receiving transactions, storing its own NFTs, participating in airdrops and so on;\n\nERC 6551 standard is backward-compatible: it can equip every existing non-fungible token with advanced functionality;\n\nNew standard is authored by CryptoKitties co-creator Jayden Windle and Benny Giang of Future Primitive;\n\nERC 6551-enabled NFTs can be used in decentralized gaming, reputation management, on-chain messaging, analytics, trading and so on.\n\nFrom the very beginning, the standard has been developed in an open-source manner. However, its authors stressed that some Web3 companies are already working on instruments designed to make the "upgrading" of NFTs easier.\n\nWhat are NFTs?\n\nNon-fungible tokens, or NFTs, represent the type of cryptocurrency token with some unique features. While basically all cryptocurrency tokens (just like fiat currencies) are fungible ‚Äî e.g. you can always replace 1 USDT with 1 USDT, 1 BTC with 1 BTC ‚Äî every NFT is a unique token.\n\nUnder the hood, NFTs should be considered as contracts regarding ownership of some content. Should we check out the code of the majority of NFTs, we can find that they are tokenized agreements: "This is to certify that Ethereum account 0xabcd‚Ä¶owns the file Azuki4771.jpg starting from the block 123456." As such, most NFTs can be interpreted as tokenized digital property rights.\n\nUsers typically mint NFTs associated with digital content: images, texts, songs, videos, characters and in-game assets.\n\nWhat is ERC 721?\n\nEthereum Request for Comments 721, or ERC 721, is a standard on the Ethereum blockchain, i.e., the standardized design of non-fungible tokens. Introduced in December 2017, this format paved the way for standard NFTs: developers are able to launch them in a streamlined manner.\n\nOn the other hand, ERC 721 is a sample of a smart contract, i.e., a code template that describes basic NFT functionality. All mainstream NFT collections ‚Äî Bored Ape Yacht Club, Azuki, RTFKT ‚Äî include ERC 721 tokens. Also, it is a backbone element of the tooling of all of the top NFT marketplaces: OpenSea, LooksRare, Rarible, Blur and so on.\n\nHow to create NFTs?\n\nBasically, there are two ways to create non-fungible tokens yourself. First, you can try using no-code instruments like Mintable. With them, users can just upload their content, pay gas fees and get their NFTs minted. On some L2 chains, NFTs can even be minted in a gasless manner.\n\nThen, NFTs can be created with OpenZeppelin code templates. To create a token this way, the user needs to set up a MetaMask wallet, pay fees (or claim testnet tokens from the faucet), take the ERC 721 code template, compile it and deploy it to the network ‚Äî either Ethereum or Polygon.\n\nWhat are Ordinals Bitcoin NFTs?\n\nWhile, typically, NFTs are associated with programmable blockchains (that support smart contracts), in 2023, the hype around "Bitcoin NFTs" ‚Äî also known as "Inscriptions" or "Ordinals" ‚Äî gained steam.\n\nOrdinals is a technology that allows attaching data to Bitcoin (BTC) transactions. As satoshis in Bitcoin (BTC) can be modified, users can equip them with content, from .jpeg files to JSON data.\n\nHowever, this standard cannot go mainstream as it is technically sophisticated: to create Ordinals, you need to run a full Bitcoin (BTC) node. Also, the activity of Ordinals creators made the Bitcoin (BTC) network almost unusable.\n\nWhat is Account Abstraction?\n\nAccount Abstraction, or ERC 4337, is a technology that allows Ethereum (ETH) wallets to act like decentralized banks. It blurs the line between wallets and smart contracts and paves the way for a new type of entity in Ethereum and EVM compatible blockchains, i.e., "smart wallets."\n\nAccount Abstraction was introduced in early 2023 and is usually described as the "next big thing" in Ethereum (ETH) functionality.\n\nVitalik Buterin described this concept as one of the three pillars of Ethereum\'s (ETH) progress in its transition toward a mature tech stack.\n\nERC 6551 or Token Bound Accounts: First comprehensive guide\n\nERC 6551 is a novel mechanism in the Ethereum (ETH) segment. It allows NFTs to be equipped with an additional layer of wallet functionality.\n\nERC...'}]

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
The news articles suggest a bullish trend for Ethereum (ETH) in the cryptocurrency market. The increase in ETH staked supply and the decrease in ETH exchange supply indicate growing interest in staking and holding ETH, leading to a reduction in liquid supply. Additionally, the introduction of ERC 6551 for NFTs on Ethereum enhances the functionality and utility of NFTs, potentially attracting more users and investors to the Ethereum ecosystem. With technical charts indicating a potential price breakout above $1,900 and a target of $3,000, coupled with positive market indicators, the overall sentiment points towards a bullish outlook for Ethereum in the near term.

The topic that ignited the heated discussion was the contentious issue of cryptocurrency regulation, specifically concerning the fate of XRP and Ethereum (ETH) in the face of mounting pressure from the SEC.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKeiser unequivocally stated that the regulatory overreach would inevitably lead to the demise of XRP and every other cryptocurrency, except for Bitcoin, which he deemed "untouchable."\n\nOf course the SEC is \'overreaching\' but that won\'t stop them from killing off XRP and every other shitcoin.

He countered by highlighting the SEC\'s prior labeling of Bitcoin as a security. While conceding that the commission could inflict damage on XRP, Deaton believed that the influence of its current transient regulator, Gary Gensler, would be short-lived.\n\nHe further argued that software code itself should not be classified as a security, emphasizing the need for a level playing field where the best technologies could thrive.\n\nUnswayed by Deaton\'s arguments, Keiser remained steadfast in his belief that both ETH and XRP would suffer the same fate. Dismissing chatter about Bitcoin as inconsequential, he declared that Gensler, the current SEC chairman, would pursue Ethereum and XRP as unregistered securities.\n\nKeiser went on to assert that the regulator functioned as a protection racket for the banking cartel, ready to employ national security and the Patriot Act if necessary to eliminate these projects.'}, {'id': 88, 'time': 'Sun, 25 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'ETH Bulls Aim at $2K But is a Retest of $1.8K Coming First? (Ethereum Price Analysis) - CryptoPotato', 'content': 'Ethereum‚Äôs price recently received support at the 200-day moving average and subsequently embarked on a strong bullish rally, breaking above the 100-day MA. This could be a positive indicator for Ethereum‚Äôs mid-term prospects, but it also carries the risk of being a bull trap.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nAfter a period of correction and a significant downtrend, the price reached the $1.6K level, which coincided with the 200-day moving average and found support. The significant buying pressure at this level triggered a rapid reversal and an upward trend toward the critical resistance zone around $2K.\n\nAdditionally, the price surpassed the 100-day moving average at $1.8K, suggesting a bullish bias for Ethereum in the mid-term. However, to confirm the presence of a bull market in 2023 and restore sufficient demand to the market, Ethereum‚Äôs price still needs to overcome the substantial resistance at the $2K region and consolidate above.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nIn general, the Fibonacci retracement tool is helpful for identifying potential reversal points and correction targets during impulsive trends. As previously mentioned, Ethereum‚Äôs price experienced a mid-term correction phase after reaching the yearly high of $2.1K through an impulsive uptrend.\n\nExamining the chart reveals that the bearish correction leg found support and reversed at the 61.8% retracement level, a commonly observed target for correction phases. The prevailing buying pressure within this critical range resulted in a robust bullish trend towards the $2K region.\n\nIf the price successfully surpasses the significant resistance around $2K, it will pave the way for a mid-term bullish trend, as this level holds psychological significance. However, it is worth considering the bearish divergence between the price and the RSI indicator, which suggests the possibility of a slight rejection and short-term consolidation before Ethereum makes its next move.\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nEthereum has been consolidating below the $2K level for the past few months after being rejected from that level. The uncertainty seen on the price chart is also reflected in the futures market sentiment.\n\nThis chart displays the Funding Rates metric, which indicates whether the futures market sentiment is bullish or bearish. Recently, after a period of correction in the market, which coincided with a downtrend in the funding rates metric, the price found support and began a strong rally.\n\nHowever, the metric has started to show a slight uptrend during this bullish rally, suggesting increased buying pressure and a greater tendency among participants to take long positions rather than short positions.\n\nWhile this could be seen as a bullish sign for the market, traders should exercise caution as it may actually be a bull trap, potentially leading to a long-squeeze event.'}, {'id': 84, 'time': 'Sun, 25 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum: Here‚Äôs the silver lining to its declining trends - AMBCrypto News', 'content': 'ETH price hovered around $1,890, inching closer to the $1,900 price zone.\n\nETH supply on exchanges continued to decline, reaching a record low.\n\nEthereum [ETH] trended sideways for weeks and eventually slid.

Nevertheless, amidst this surge, the available supply of Ethereum on exchanges has been steadily dwindling, adding an intriguing twist to the unfolding narrative.\n\nRead Ethereum‚Äôs [ETH] Price Prediction 2023- 24\n\nEthereum maintains a bull trend\n\nLooking at the daily timeframe chart of Ethereum revealed an intriguing journey that began around 15 June when it initiated its upward surge.

While it has yet to reclaim the $2,000 price range, an exciting development unfolded as it successfully shattered the resistance posed by its short Moving Average (yellow line) around the $1,820 price zone.\n\nThis breakthrough indicated a positive shift in the prevailing trend.\n\nThe press time price trajectory has also propelled Ethereum into a bull run, as evidenced by its Relative Strength Index (RSI). As of this writing, the RSI line stood above 60, signifying a strong bullish trend.\n\nEthereum on exchanges declines\n\nDespite Ethereum‚Äôs valiant efforts toward recovery, a fascinating phenomenon persists‚Äîthe dwindling supply of ETH on exchanges. Santiment‚Äôs data revealed that the supply on exchanges, as a percentage of the total supply, had reached an all-time low.\n\nAs of this writing, this supply had declined to approximately 9.1%, marking its lowest level since Ethereum‚Äôs inception.\n\nThe decline in supply commenced back in January, but it was during May that a sharp downturn became apparent. This downward trajectory has persisted until now, further deepening the scarcity of Ethereum available on exchanges.\n\nETH profitability for long-term holders\n\nExamining the profitability of Ethereum for long-term holders revealed that, despite the recent uptrends, they have yet to translate into profitability for these holders.\n\nAs of this writing, the two-year Market Value to Realized Value ratio (MVRV) had dipped below zero, standing at -10% at press time. This indicated that individuals who have held onto ETH during this specific held at a loss.\n\nHowever, there remained a glimmer of hope. A sustained increase in value could potentially propel these holders into a more profitable zone, alleviating their loss position at press time.\n\nFurthermore, traders, as per data provided by CoinGlass, held optimistic expectations for an impending price surge. As of this writing, the funding rate on CoinGlass stood in positive territory.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nThis was a significant indicator of positive sentiment among traders actively taking long positions.\n\nIt is worth noting that a price rise could further enhance the positivity of the funding rate, potentially attracting more traders to take long positions.

But there‚Äôs a compelling twist in the mix: you can earn small amounts of Bitcoin or Ethereum by playing.\n\nThis feature is not enabled by default when you start playing Bling games like Sweet Bitcoin, Ethereum Blast, or Bitcoin Pop. Luckily, it‚Äôs easy to start earning Bling Points while you play levels and watch ads, and then those Points can be converted into BTC or ETH and then deposited into a Coinbase or PayPal account.\n\nWant to earn a little crypto while gaming? Here‚Äôs another way to do so.\n\nHow do I turn on crypto earnings?\n\nBy default, Bling‚Äôs games just look and play like standard mobile games‚Äîalbeit ones with a lot of video ads in the mix. To earn cryptocurrency for playing, you‚Äôll need to enable the feature by signing in with an account.\n\nJust tap the ‚ÄúGet Started‚Äù button at the top of a Bling app screen and then choose whether to log in with a Google or Facebook account or Apple account if you're using iOS. Tapping the downward-pointing arrow at the bottom also unearths an option to log in with an email address instead. Once logged in, you‚Äôll earn Bling Points that can be redeemed for Bitcoin or Ethereum.\n\nScreenshots from Sweet Bitcoin, a Bling Financial game. Image: Decrypt\n\nWhich games does this work with?\n\nAs of this writing, Bling offers nine mobile games across iOS and Android that offer crypto rewards. The in-game interfaces are largely identical, and they all share the same Bling account so you can earn across games. Here are the games available so far, although this list may change over time:\n\nBitcoin Blast (iOS | Android)\n\nBitcoin Blocks (iOS | Android)\n\nBitcoin Food Fight (iOS | Android)\n\nBitcoin Pop (iOS | Android)\n\nBitcoin Solitaire (iOS | Android)\n\nBitcoin Sudoku (iOS | Android)\n\nEthereum Blast (iOS | Android)\n\nSweet Bitcoin (iOS | Android)\n\nWord Breeze (iOS | Android)\n\nHow do I cash out?\n\nYou‚Äôll need to use the Bling Financial website to cash in your earned points for cryptocurrency and deposit your winnings. Simply click the ‚ÄúCash Out‚Äù button in the upper right corner of the Bling website, and then log in with the same account you used in the Bling app.\n\nStory continues\n\nConverting Bling Points to Bitcoin. Image: Decrypt\n\nBling will show you how much you‚Äôve earned. In this example, I have nearly 60,000 Bling points, which equates to 0.00000060 BTC‚Äîor just under $0.02 worth of Bitcoin as of this writing.\n\nYou can then choose either Bitcoin or Ethereum, and have the earnings transferred to a Coinbase account‚Äîor you can choose U.S. dollars and send that to a PayPal account. After cashing out, you‚Äôll have to wait seven days to do so again."}, {'id': 7, 'time': 'Mon, 26 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'HSBC Hong Kong Launches Support for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs - Yahoo Finance', 'content': "HSBC Hong Kong customers can now trade Bitcoin and Ethereum futures Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), broadening access to digital asset derivatives in the emerging Asia crypto hub.\n\nThe ETFs, which are traded as securities, were listed on HSBC Hong Kong‚Äôs so-called ‚ÄúEasy Invest‚Äù mobile app on Monday. They offer traders exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum futures based on derivative contracts that trade on commodity exchanges.\n\nThe specific offerings are CSOP Bitcoin Futures ETF, CSOP Ethereum Futures ETF, and Samsung Bitcoin Futures Active ETF, a representative from HSBC Hong Kong confirmed to Decrypt. The news was first reported by Chinese crypto journalist Colin Wu.\n\nSCOOP: HSBC, the largest bank in Hong Kong, today allows its customers to buy and sell Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs listed on the Hong Kong exchange, and is also the first bank in Hong Kong to allow it. The move will expand local users‚Äô exposure to cryptocurrencies in Hong Kong. pic.twitter.com/vH0LieSVGw ‚Äî Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) June 26, 2023\n\nHSBC is the largest bank in Hong Kong, Wu said, and HSBC is the first lender in Hong Kong to allow its customers access to digital asset ETFs.\n\nAdding ETFs to its investment platform offers HSBC Hong Kong investors access to derivatives, without which customers might seek out access on an unregulated exchange, possibly using a VPN, Sei Labs co-founder Jeff Feng told Decrypt.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a clear opportunity for [HSBC] to get ahead and offer this one product that is otherwise not allowed in Hong Kong,‚Äù he said, adding there‚Äôs a ‚Äúclear customer need.‚Äù\n\nThe CSOP Bitcoin Futures ETF and CSOP Ethereum Futures ETF are managed by CSOP Asset Management, a firm that saw the two products listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in December of last year. The two ETFs were the first in Asia to track digital asset futures, according to the firm‚Äôs website.\n\nStory continues\n\nBoth ETFs invest in futures contracts that trade on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), making them an ‚Äúeasy transparent way for investors to capture the performance‚Äù of Bitcoin and Ethereum, according to CSOP Asset Management.\n\nThe Samsung Bitcoin Futures Active ETF is managed by Samsung Asset Management Hong Kong and invests in CME contracts as well, but launched in January of this year.\n\nWhile there‚Äôs robust demand for spot access to crypto among retail investors in Hong Kong, Feng said that the demand for derivatives is equal, if not greater. And ETFs allow companies to offer exposure to crypto without opening themselves to regulatory risk in a nascent industry to which Hong Kong has only recently signaled openness.\n\n‚ÄúIf all of the centralized exchanges are getting this much regulatory scrutiny, it wouldn't be too wise to go out and try to launch another,‚Äù Feng said of crypto exchanges more generally. ‚ÄúIt's much safer to do what's already been proven. There's a clear playbook.‚Äù\n\nFutures ETFs correlated to the performance of digital assets are nothing new in the United States. While the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has not approved a spot-based Bitcoin ETF yet‚ÄîBlackRock wants to change that‚ÄîProShares' Bitcoin futures ETF launched on the New York Stock Exchange in 2021.\n\nFeng said the ‚Äúsimplicity and convenience‚Äù of ETFs make them a much more palatable option for retail traders compared to other derivatives, such as options, where traders need to understand concepts like strike prices and gamma.\n\n‚ÄúWhen you have simplicity, what you eventually will get is volume,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúPeople will eventually speculate because it‚Äôs just so easy.‚Äù"}, {'id': 4, 'time': 'Mon, 26 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum Poised To Break $2,000 As $12 Million Short Seller Nears Liquidation - NewsBTC', 'content': 'The Ethereum price has followed Bitcoin‚Äôs lead and has seen a 10.3% price increase over the past seven days. News of BlackRock‚Äôs Bitcoin spot ETF filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission took the entire market by surprise and also breathed new life into altcoins. For one trader on the decentralized perpetual exchange GMX, however, the news is not really good news, but rather a nightmare.\n\nEthereum Short Seller Getting Rekt?\n\nThe largest short seller on GMX is using 6.64x leverage to short Ether (ETH) at an entry price of $1,703.97. A total of $1.8 million of collateral is at stake for the anonymous trader. At press time, the position was down 77.4% for a total of -$1.416 million.\n\nAs it stands, the trader‚Äôs short position of about $12 million in ETH will be liquidated when the Ethereum price reaches $1,945.18. According to a report from Chinese journalist Colin Wu, it could be the owner of rebelvarma.lens.\n\nAs popular analyst An Ape‚Äôs Prologue speculates, the ETH short seller could even double down on his bet. As the analyst writes, the consensus assumes that the short position will be liquidated when ETH reaches $1945. However, there are limit orders that could add a total of $149,000 to the trader‚Äôs collateral within the $1935 and $1945 price range. If triggered, this could increase the liquidation price to around $1967.\n\nThe analyst‚Äôs chart below shows how his liquidation price changes with ETH price swings. Until Ethereum reaches $1935, the liquidation price remains at $1945, but limit orders are triggered when ETH enters the $1935 and $1945 range, increasing the liquidation price to $1967.\n\nIn addition, the analyst notes that the address holds about $224,000 worth of other assets spread across Arbitrum and the Binance Smart Chain: $90,000 in USDT, $51,000 in USDC, $64,000 in WBTC and $21,500 in AAVE.\n\n‚ÄúWith a history of mitigating liquidation risk by bridging tokens from other chains to Arbitrum for collateral, we‚Äôll probably see a similar strategy if ETH prices increase. The $224k in available assets could be used to top up collateral in this scenario,‚Äù the analyst notes.\n\nIf the ETH short seller uses up all of its assets and puts them up as collateral, the maximum liquidation price could rise to around $2,000, representing a further 6.5% price increase from the current price. Hence, Twitter user @apes_prologue concludes:\n\nWhile his position appears risky, the danger of liquidation is not as imminent as popularly believed, as he has mechanisms at his disposal to protect his position. Additionally, it is also possible he could have hedged his position in other markets that we are unaware of.\n\nETH On The Verge Of Breaking Above $2,000?\n\nRumors are circulating in the crypto community that the liquidation of the GMX short-seller could trigger a breakout of ETH above $2,000. The 1-hour chart of Ether shows that the price is currently stuck in the price range between $1,964 and $1,930 for the moment. A breakout to the upside or downside could be decisive for the next move.\n\nA look at the 1-day chart reveals that a breakout above $1,930 does not necessarily mean a follow-through to above $2,000. The 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level is at $1,975, where major resistance is expected. Ethereum bulls can only target the psychologically important $2,000 level if they break out above this price level.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Source: Adobe\n\nAfter hitting its highest level in a little under eight months on Wednesday in the mid-$1,900s, Ether (ETH) is experiencing a modest pullback and was last changing hands in the mid-$1,800s.\n\nOn the day, the world‚Äôs second most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization that powers the world‚Äôs most widely used smart-contract-enabled Ethereum blockchain is down a little over 2%, according to TradingView.\n\nBut the cryptocurrency‚Äôs near-term technical outlook continues to look good. ETH has been finding decent support recently from its 21-Day Moving Average, and all of its other major moving averages are on the rise in consecutive order.\n\nThe fact that ETH is currently finding decent support in the mid-$1,800s has spurred optimism that an extension of gains in the short-term toward the August 2022 highs just above $2,000 remains a strong likelihood.\n\nMoreover, ETH‚Äôs 14-Day Relative Strength Index (RSI) is not yet in overbought territory, suggesting a reduced risk of near-term profit-taking.\n\nSome analysts and traders have expressed concerns that, in the wake of a series of key upgrades to the Ethereum blockchain on the 12th of April, ETH could experience some short-term selling pressure.\n\nThe so-called ‚ÄúShapella‚Äù upgrade will, amongst other things, allow for the withdrawal of staked Ether tokens.\n\nMost analysts view the development as a long-term positive for the network ‚Äì it is assumed that more flexible staking withdrawals will eventually attract many more ETH owners into staking their tokens.\n\nBut some think ETH could experience either a ‚Äúsell-the-news‚Äù reaction and have warned that there could be short-term price pressures as investors sell ETH tokens that have been stuck in staking contracts for a long time.\n\nETH staking has been active since late-2020 on Ethereum‚Äôs beacon chain, before the Ethereum blockchain‚Äôs merge to proof-of-stake last September.\n\nPrice Prediction ‚Äì Can ETH Hit An All-Time High in 2023?\n\nEven if ETH was to experience a post-Shapella upgrade dip, many expect the downside would be short-lived.\n\nETH also saw a strong bounce from its 200DMA last month, a strong medium-term bullish indicator.\n\nThe ‚Äúgolden cross‚Äù (when the 50-Day Moving Average crosses above the 200-Day Moving Average) in early February is another good sign for ETH‚Äôs medium-term technical outlook.\n\nMoreover, macro tailwinds, such as expectations that the Fed will be cutting interest rates later this year to stave off a bank crisis and recession, continue to offer crypto markets broad support.\n\nWhile it can certainly be said that ETH has a positive medium-to-long-term outlook, betting on the cryptocurrency to return to all-time highs this year is another thing.\n\nEther hitting fresh all-time highs this year would require it to rally 160% from current levels.\n\nBut this is the crypto market. ETH is already up more than 100% from last year‚Äôs lows in the $800s.\n\nAnd between the months of November 2020 and April 2021, Ether gained 600%.\n\nA 160% rally this year should thus by no means be ruled out as a possibility.\n\nBuy Ethereum Now\n\nEthereum Alternatives to Consider\n\nWhile ETH‚Äôs outlook is strong, investors should nonetheless always be on the lookout to diversify their crypto holdings.\n\nOne high-risk-high-reward investment strategy that some investors might want to consider is getting involved in crypto presales.\n\nThis is where investors buy the tokens of up-start crypto projects to help fund their development.\n\nThese tokens are nearly always sold very cheap and there is a long history of presales delivering huge exponential gains to early investors.\n\nMany of these projects have fantastic teams behind them and a great vision to deliver a revolutionary crypto application/platform.\n\nIf an investor can identify such projects, the risk/reward of their presale investment is very good.\n\nThe team at Cryptonews spends a lot of time combing through presale projects to help investors out.\n\nHere is a list of 15 of what the project deems as the best crypto presales of 2023.\n\nDisclaimer: The Industry Talk section features insights by crypto industry players and is not a part of the editorial content of Cryptonews.com.'}]

The news articles suggest a mixed outlook for the Ethereum (ETH) cryptocurrency market. On one hand, the introduction of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs by HSBC Hong Kong could potentially increase demand and accessibility for digital asset derivatives, indicating a positive market trend. However, the presence of a significant short seller on GMX using leverage to bet against ETH, facing potential liquidation as the price approaches $2,000, could create short-term volatility and downward pressure on the market. Additionally, as the Shanghai upgrade approaches, there are concerns about potential short-term selling pressure post-upgrade.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is experiencing volatility with fluctuating trends in open prices, total transactions, gas usage, and average gas prices. The market sentiment seems uncertain as indicated by the MACD signal switching between buy and sell. On the other hand, the news analyst report paints a more positive picture for Ethereum, highlighting potential catalysts such as Casa's multisignature vault launch and the Ethereum Rainbow chart indicating a price increase. The overall sentiment from the news report suggests a bullish trend for ETH in the near future.

Considering the reflection analyst report, it is evident that a balanced and cautious approach has been effective in navigating the uncertain market conditions for ETH. By synthesizing the information from both the on-chain and news reports, it is crucial to adopt a long-term strategy that prioritizes risk management and profitability.

Given the mixed signals from the reports and the current market uncertainty, a conservative trading approach is warranted. It is important to stay vigilant, monitor key indicators, and adapt to market fluctuations to maximize profitability over the long term. Therefore, my trading action would be to buy ETH with a confidence level of 0.5, reflecting a neutral stance with a slight inclination towards a bullish trend in the long term. This decision allows for potential gains while managing risks appropriately in the volatile market environment.

DAILY RETURN:
-0.00835116826644533
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain, news, and reflection analyst reports, it is clear that there are mixed signals in the ETH market. The on-chain data indicates potential volatility with a bearish bias based on the MACD signal, while the news suggests a bullish outlook for Ethereum due to increasing interest in staking, NFT developments, and technical chart patterns pointing towards a potential price breakout.

Considering the conflicting signals, it is important to adopt a cautious and balanced approach in trading ETH. While short-term gains may be possible, it is crucial to prioritize long-term profitability and risk management. By staying vigilant and adaptable to market fluctuations, traders can navigate the uncertainty and maximize profitability over time.

Given the current market conditions, I would recommend a conservative trading strategy to mitigate risks. Therefore, my trading action would be to buy ETH with a confidence level of 0.3, indicating a moderate level of confidence in the potential bullish outlook for Ethereum in the long term. This decision aligns with the goal of managing risks while aiming for sustainable profitability in the volatile cryptocurrency market.
ACTION:

DAILY RETURN:
0.012262449130932662
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing bearish sentiment, with fluctuations in price, transaction volume, and network activity. The MACD signal consistently indicates a sell trend, suggesting a potential for further price declines in the near future. On the other hand, the news analyst report presents a more positive outlook, highlighting bullish technical indicators and potential price targets reaching $3,000 due to declining exchange balances and increasing staking deposits. However, regulatory uncertainties pose a risk to the market.

In light of these mixed signals, it is important to take a balanced and cautious approach to trading ETH. By synthesizing information from both reports, it is evident that a conservative trading strategy focused on long-term profitability and risk management is warranted. While short-term gains may be possible, the focus should be on sustainable profitability over time.

Considering the current market uncertainty and the need for a conservative approach, I would take a slightly bearish stance on ETH trading. My trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.3, reflecting a moderate level of caution in response to the mixed signals and potential risks in the market.

Social media platforms have become hotbeds of discussion, particularly regarding the potential implications of former SEC director Bill Hinman‚Äôs stance on Ethereum (ETH) in relation to the Ripple case.\n\nHere‚Äôs what the latest dialogue was all about.\n\nRipple Case Mired in Intrigue and Speculation\n\nA blockchain specialist going by the moniker ‚ÄòMr. Huber‚Äô responded to a tweet questioning the relevance of Hinman‚Äôs viewpoint on Ethereum to the evidence stacked against Ripple.

Scenario 2: The second scenario considers that if Judge Torres deems that Hinman‚Äôs exclusion of Ethereum as a security was unlawful, yet a rational individual could have believed that XRP would be governed by similar regulations based on Hinman‚Äôs public stance, XRP might have been sold as a security, but without proper notice, leading again to no penalties.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple News: XRP Price Might Surge More Than 20% If This Scenario Plays Out\n\nControversy Surrounding Hinman‚Äôs Role\n\nAttorney Bill Morgan has introduced a provocative theory regarding the relationship between Hinman and Ethereum.

One of the most valuable digital assets on the planet, it is a decentralized platform that enables developers to create and deploy distributed apps. Who, holds the most Ethereum, or better said ‚Äì WHAT holds the most Ethereum?\n\nThe Biggest ETH Holders Are Not Individuals\n\nThere were 236.48 million Ethereum holders as of June 27, with the top 10 holders holding 31.49%, according to CoinCarp . A year ago, this number stood at 199.31 million, representing an 18.38% increase.\n\nHowever, owners of Ethereum are not only hard to find but also hard to track down. Since many holders will have many addresses, the Ethereum wallet address cannot be used to represent a single individual.\n\nBut when it comes to Ethereum, the biggest ETH holders don‚Äôt get as much attention. Who possesses the most may be easily seen by using an Ethereum block explorer like EtherScan .\n\nAs it can be seen, the largest holdings are frequently companies rather than individuals, but there are undoubtedly some ETH whales, just like there are Bitcoin whales.\n\nSince there is no universal method to identify the owners of Ethereum addresses, there are no public records of ‚ÄúEthereum millionaires.‚Äù However, there are businesses that specialize in locating persons using addresses. It has been claimed that some well-known members of the Ethereum community, including Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Lubin, have amassed riches as a result of their work on the project. They are frequently called ‚ÄúEthereum whales.‚Äù They can influence market mood thanks to their huge wallets.\n\nThey are hopeful about the future of peer-to-peer payments as well as the longer-term application of Ethereum for computing power. Ethereum appeals to many because of its unparalleled versatility.\n\nThe majority of the biggest Ethereum holders are obviously the exchanges, but there are some individuals and protocols holding a lot as well.\n\nTop Ethereum Holders\n\n1) Beacon Chain Contract: ~18 million ETH\n\nThe Beacon Chain contract was the one employed by Ethereum during the transition from proof of work to proof of stake, which was successfully completed in the fall of 2022 with the Merge phase.\n\nOnce the transition to proof of stake was complete, Ethereum owners had the option of staking their cryptocurrency to this address in order to get rewards. The ETH of many large exchanges, including Coinbase and Binance, was pooled to be staked to this contract, which is still being carried out. With more than 18 million ETH in the contract, it is the biggest ETH holder.\n\n2) Binance: ~4.4 million ETH\n\nIt shouldn‚Äôt come as a surprise that one of the largest holders of ETH is also the largest exchange in the world based on trading volume.\n\nHowever, it might come as a surprise to learn that, if you sum up only three of the primary Binance Ethereum addresses, they really control more over 4 million ETH, making them the second-largest ETH holder. The largest amount of Ethereum is unquestionably held by that exchange. Along with their Binance-Peg Tokens address, there are Binance 7, 8, and 14 addresses, which are exchange wallets utilized for various exchange services.\n\nWhen users of the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) bridge their ETH to the BSC, the ETH is held here. It is kept at this Peg address until the ETH is transferred back to Ethereum from the BSC. Address 7, 8, and the peg address are all top 10 holders individually, while Binance 14 is 19th.\n\n3) Wrapped ETH Contract: ~3.7 million ETH\n\nWETH wrapped ETH is another well-liked contract. Since ETH by itself is not an ERC-20 token, using it with DeFi programs like Uniswap is challenging, so the developers developed a method to ‚Äúwrap‚Äù ETH in an ERC-20 token. This makes it compatible with a wide range of apps. It is only more useful; its cost is the same as that of normal ETH. With more than 3.7 million ETH, the WETH contract is the second-largest single address for ETH.\n\n4) Kraken: ~1.7 million ETH\n\nAnother significant ETH holder is Kraken, which ranks fourth with more than 1.7 million and was recently charged by the SEC for its ETH and several other staking possibilities. Even though Kraken is one of the most popular exchanges in terms of trading volume, it appears more plausible that it serves as some form of storage as most exchanges would split up holdings between wallets if they were ‚Äúhot.‚Äù\n\n5) Unknown Fund: ~1.6 million ETH\n\nThe sole description of the fifth-largest Ethereum holder is ‚ÄúFund‚Äù, with no other details. This fund‚Äôs nature, purpose, and controller are all unknown. It it be the largest Ethe...'}, {'id': 0, 'time': 'Tue, 27 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "What is the Ethereum Blockchain: A Beginner's Guide - CCN.com", 'content': 'Key Takeaways\n\nEthereum blockchain was created to address the limitations of Bitcoin and provide a platform for developers to build decentralized applications using smart contracts.\n\nA hard fork in 2016 resulted in the creation of two separate Ethereum networks called Ethereum (the current version) and Ethereum Classic.\n\nIt transitioned from a proof of work (PoW) to a proof of stake (PoS) consensus mechanism in 2022 to address energy consumption concerns and improve scalability.\n\nEthereum blockchain offers versatility and cost efficiency through its support for smart contracts, enabling innovation and reducing transaction costs.\n\nIn 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto introduced a groundbreaking alternative to fiat currency using cryptography to form a sound medium of exchange, called Bitcoin, which became the first cryptocurrency that offered a decentralized alternative to centralized traditional currencies.\n\nBitcoin‚Äôs creation opened the door to a new era of financial freedom and innovation. The potential of blockchain technology was swiftly realized, explored, and admired by numerous individuals. As a result, developers and cryptography enthusiasts began to contemplate whether blockchain had more untapped potential.\n\nWhen he was merely nineteen years old, Vitalik Buterin, one of the founders of the Ethereum blockchain, embarked on an audacious new venture with a mission to push the boundaries of Bitcoin‚Äôs capabilities.\n\nBitcoin, due to its limited design, lacked the versatility to support various functionalities, prompting Vitalik to conceive Ethereum. The latter aimed to establish a platform where developers could construct decentralized applications using smart contracts.\n\nTo realize this vision, a team of individuals such as Gavin Wood (creator of Polkadot and Kusama), Charles Hoskinson (creator of the Cardano blockchain), and Joseph Lubin (founder of ConsenSys), among others, worked assiduously to bring Ethereum to fruition.\n\nLaunched in 2015, Ethereum was initially built on a proof of work (PoW) consensus mechanism, much like its predecessor, Bitcoin. However, the network was designed to be more than just a cryptocurrency exchange platform and switched to proof of stake (PoS) consensus mechanism in 2022. As Ethereum‚Äôs story continues to unfold, its community eagerly awaits the many innovations and developments that lie ahead.\n\nWhat Is The Ethereum Blockchain\n\nAs of Q2 2023, Ethereum blockchain holds the second spot on CoinMarketCap as the largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of $220 billion. The project offers a total and leading technology with a vision to change the world in a variety of interesting and debatable ways.\n\nEthereum is an attempt at a decentralized blockchain platform that offers unique features centered around the provision of smart contracts, decentralized finance (DeFi), and decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nA smart contract can be likened to a digital vending machine. When you insert the precise amount of coins into the machine and select your desired beverage, you‚Äôre essentially entering into a smart contract with the vending machine.\n\nThis is because the vending machine acknowledges your payment, identifies the specific drink you‚Äôve chosen, and fulfills its end of the deal by dispensing the beverage. Fundamentally, a smart contract functions on the same principle as a vending machine: it is straightforward and reliable.\n\nSmart contracts serve as the foundation of Ethereum‚Äôs vision, enabling the development of DeFi and dApps on its platform. These self-executing contracts have terms of the agreement directly written into code and are immutable once deployed on the Ethereum network. This means once the contract is entered it cannot be changed.\n\nEther (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum, powers these smart contracts and is used as a fuel for transactions and computational services on the network.\n\nHistory Of The Ethereum Blockchain\n\nEthereum, like Bitcoin, has a rich history, and has faced many challenges, such as its infamous DAO attack in 2016. The decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) was a blockchain-based venture capital fund that utilized smart contracts to allow investors to fund projects and receive returns on their investments. However, the smart contract code contained a flaw that enabled the attacker to drain a significant amount of ETH from the DAO‚Äôs funds into a child DAO.\n\nThe DAO attack ultimately led to a hard fork of the Ethereum network, which involved rolling back the blockchain to a previous state to undo the damage caused by the attack. This fork resulted in the creation of two separate Ethereum networks, the current Ethereum blockchain (resulting forked blockchain) and Ethereum Classic (the original version of the Ethereum blockchain).\n\nIt is important to note that Ethereum Classic still uses the PoW consensus method, whereas Ethereum moved to a PoS consensus mechanism, commonly known as the Merge upgrade.

Discover SCENE\n\nThough the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is waging legal war across the crypto space, Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin isn‚Äôt breaking a sweat.\n\nWhen asked about regulators potentially treating Ether (ETH) like a security, the Consensys CEO explained during a Tuesday interview with CNBC that the regulatory verdict on Ethereum is already in.\n\n‚ÄúThe SEC has spoken,‚Äù he said, referring to former SEC commissioner Bill Hinman‚Äôs 2018 speech on crypto securities and Ethereum.\n\n\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNew documents have revealed that Hinman received multiple warnings from colleagues that the speech could confuse markets into thinking that the SEC had already deemed the asset a non-security.\n\n\n\nA security is a financial instrument often (but not always) associated with some kind of investment contract. A commodity, by contrast, is a basic or natural good, like gold, wheat, or cattle.\n\n‚ÄúThe CFTC has spoken very crisply a number of times that they consider Ether like a commodity,‚Äù added Lubin.\n\nWhile Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Rostin Benham agrees that many cryptocurrencies are securities, he also thinks the three top assets‚Äîincluding Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum, and Tether (USDT)‚Äîbelong under his agency‚Äôs jurisdiction as commodities.\n\nSEC Chairman Gary Gensler, by contrast, has only publicly deemed Bitcoin as such.\n\n\n\nOn the topic of Ether, Gensler has kept a tight lip. Some videos from his time as an MIT professor suggest he once thought it was a security, while others indicate he believed it had graduated from a security into a commodity by 2018.\n\nMembers of Congress are drafting legislation to clear up this issue, including Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand, and have voiced agreement with the CFTC that Ether is a commodity alongside Bitcoin.\n\n\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really a forgone conclusion at this point,‚Äù said Lubin. ‚ÄúThere may be a regulator or two in the United States that can‚Äôt bring himself to utter the fact that Ether is not a security, but I don‚Äôt know why that‚Äôs the case.‚Äù\n\n\n\nThe SEC sued Binance and Coinbase earlier this month alleging that over a dozen assets listed on their platform were securities, including Paxos-issued stablecoin BUSD.\n\nAD\n\nAD'}, {'id': 4, 'time': 'Wed, 28 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum Price Indicators Signal Extended Correction To $1,790 - NewsBTC', 'content': 'Ethereum price is slowly moving lower from the $1,920 resistance against the US Dollar. ETH could extend its decline toward the $1,790 support.\n\nEthereum is still struggling to surpass the $1,920 resistance.\n\nThe price is trading below $1,900 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $1,885 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could decline further toward the $1,790 support in the coming sessions.\n\nEthereum Price Stuck In A Range\n\nEthereum‚Äôs price attempted another upside break above the key $1,920 resistance zone. ETH failed to gain bullish momentum for a close above the $1,920 level, similar to Bitcoin.\n\nA high is formed near $1,912 and the price is now moving lower. There was a break below the $1,900 level. The price declined below the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent increase from the $1,838 low to the $1,912 high. Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $1,885 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nEther is now trading below $1,900 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. It is now testing the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the recent increase from the $1,838 low to the $1,912 high.\n\nIf Ethereum stays above $1,850, it could attempt another increase. Immediate resistance is near the $1,880 level or the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The next major resistance is near the $1,900 level.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe main barrier is still near the $1,920 and $1,930 levels. A close above the $1,930 zone could start a steady increase and send the price further higher. The next resistance sits near $2,000, above which the price could rise toward the $2,050 level. Any more gains could send Ether toward the $2,120 resistance.\n\nMore Losses in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,900 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,850 level.\n\nThe next major support is near the $1,840 level. If there is a move below $1,840, the price could accelerate lower toward $1,790. Any more losses may perhaps send the price toward the $1,750 support.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD ‚Äì The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI ‚Äì The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level ‚Äì $1,840\n\nMajor Resistance Level ‚Äì $1,900\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

But it‚Äôs been on a roll this month: since the start of June, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is up 98%, jumping from $113 to $224.\n\nThe slightly obscure digital asset‚Äîone of many cryptocurrency ‚Äúforks‚Äù‚Äîis following Bitcoin, like many other coins and tokens which have surged in price since the biggest digital asset experienced a run. But BCH is doing by far the best.\n\nWhy? The coin is one of the lucky four chosen for EDX Markets, a new crypto exchange backed by major Wall Street players Charles Schwab, Citadel Securities, and Fidelity Digital Assets.\n\nEDX, which launched last week, decided to let its traders‚Äîinstitutional investors only‚Äîstart off with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash.\n\nThe reason is simple: regulatory clarity.\n\n‚ÄúThese specific cryptocurrencies are generally perceived as commodities by regulatory bodies, which significantly mitigates potential legal challenges,‚Äù Sei Labs co-founder Jeff Feng told Decrypt.\n\nYouwei Yang, Chief Economist at BTCM, added that the four assets are ‚Äúwidely regarded as digital commodities, making them relatively safe‚Äù from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission because they are made with electricity‚Äîa commodity.\n\nIn perhaps its toughest regulatory crackdown yet, the SEC has gone after a number of major crypto brands for allegedly flogging unregistered securities. Earlier this month, it went after Coinbase for allegedly offering and selling unregistered securities via its staking service. It also targeted Binance, the world‚Äôs biggest exchange, with a massive lawsuit for allegedly ‚Äúoperating as a fking [sic] unlicensed securities exchange in the U.S.A. bro,‚Äù according to the SEC.\n\nIn February, it hit Kraken with a $30 million fine for allegedly failing to register the offer and sale of its crypto asset staking-as-a-service program.\n\nEvery Crypto Project Must Reckon With the SEC's Howey Test\n\nStory continues\n\nThese regulatory enforcements are all because SEC Chairman Gary Gensler thinks‚Äîand has said for years‚Äîthat most cryptocurrencies are unregistered securities.\n\nBut he has made it clear that Bitcoin is a commodity. He has been less clear on Ethereum, but the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CTFC) has said the asset is a commodity.\n\nAnd Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin are both Bitcoin forks‚Äînew cryptocurrencies that emerged from the asset‚Äôs original code‚Äîmeaning they are likely to have the same status in the eyes of regulators.\n\nGreg Moritz, Co-Founder at the crypto hedge fund AltTab Capital, said that ‚Äúnone have been listed by the SEC as unregistered securities,‚Äù adding that all four assets are established and have history, ‚Äúkey factors in the decision-making process of EDX‚Äôs backers.‚Äù\n\nEDX Markets CEO Jamil Nazarali also said that he felt ‚Äúvery comfortable‚Äù that the four assets weren‚Äôt securities.\n\nFor now, these four ‚Äúold school‚Äù cryptocurrencies will give ‚Äúold school‚Äù investors a taste of the crypto world. But things could change, Feng noted. ‚ÄúAs regulations evolve and the understanding of different cryptocurrencies becomes more nuanced, we could anticipate exchanges like EDX broadening their offerings,‚Äù he added."}, {'id': 2, 'time': 'Wed, 28 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Ethereum price won't see $2K anytime soon, market data suggests - Cointelegraph", 'content': 'The price of Ether (ETH) faced strong resistance at $1,920 after a 17.5% rally between June 15 and June 22. Several factors contributed to the limited upside, including worsening macroeconomic conditions, the regulatory cryptocurrency environment and weaker demand for decentralized applications (DApps) on the Ethereum network.\n\nETH price faces macroeconomic headwinds\n\nOn June 26, a federal judge denied a motion from Binance that could have stopped the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from issuing public statements related to the case.\n\nIn addition, in its mid-year outlook, HSBC Asset Management‚Äôs report warned of an economic downturn in the U.S. in the fourth quarter, followed by a ‚Äúyear of contraction and a European recession in 2024‚Äù. The report also noted that ‚Äúcorporate defaults have started to creep up.‚Äù\n\nFinally, International Monetary Fund chief economist Gita Gopinath told CNBC on June 27 that central bankers should ‚Äúcontinue tightening‚Äù by keeping interest rates high for longer than expected.\n\nEthereum network demand, gas fees drop\n\nUsage of DApps on the Ethereum network failed to gain momentum as gas fees dropped 60%. Notably, the seven-day average transaction cost dropped to $3.7 on June 26, down from $9 four weeks prior.\n\nDApp active addresses also declined by 27% in the same period.\n\n30-day Ethereum DApp activity. Source: DappRadar\n\nA large chunk of the decline was concentrated on Uniswap and MetaMask Swap, while most nonfungible token (NFT) marketplaces saw a surge in their unique active wallets (UAW).\n\nDespite Uniswap NFT Aggregator‚Äôs lackluster performance, the sector faced a decent influx of users on OpenSea, Blur, Manifold, LooksRare and Unick.\n\nMore concerningly, however, is that the total value locked (TVL) ‚Äî measuring the deposits locked in Ethereum smart contracts ‚Äî reached its lowest level since August 2020. The indicator declined by 6.9% between April 28 and June 28 to 13.9 million ETH, according to DefiLlama.\n\nETH price rally not supported by derivatives markets\n\nSo how are professional traders positioned for the next ETH price move? Let‚Äôs look at Ether futures to gauge the odds of ETH/USD breaking above the $1,920 resistance.\n\nETH quarterly futures are the preferred instruments of whales and arbitrage desks. However, these fixed-month contracts usually trade at a slight premium to spot markets, as they demand an additional fee to postpone settlement.\n\nAs a result, in healthy markets, ETH futures contracts should trade at a 5‚Äì10% annualized premium, a situation known as contango.\n\nEther two-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nAccording to the futures premium ‚Äî known as the basis indicator ‚Äî professional traders have been avoiding leveraged longs (bullish bets). Despite the modest improvement to 3%, the metric remains far from the neutral 5% threshold.\n\nTo exclude externalities that might have solely impacted the Ether futures, one should analyze the ETH options markets. The 25% delta skew indicator compares similar call (buy) and put (sell) options, and will turn positive when fear is prevalent because the protective put option premium is higher than the call options.\n\nEther 30-day 25% skew. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe skew indicator will move above 8% if traders fear an Ether price crash. On the other hand, generalized excitement reflects a negative 8% skew.\n\nAs displayed above, the delta skew has been flirting with moderate optimism since June 22 but has been unable to sustain it for long. Presently, the negative 2% metric displays a balanced demand for options.\n\nResistance below $2,000 remains formidable\n\nJudging by the ETH derivatives metrics, and declining TVL and DApps use, bears are better positioned to defend the $1,920 resistance. Moreover, the worsening macroeconomic conditions and cryptocurrency regulatory news confirm the moderate pessimism for risk-on assets, including Ether.\n\nRelated: 3 reasons why Ethereum‚Äôs market cap dominance is on the rise\n\nThat does not necessarily mean that Ether is bound to retest $1,750, but it certainly presents an enormous hurdle for ETH bulls after failing to break the $1,920 level on three occasions between June 21 and June 25.\n\nConsequently, at least for the short term, bears have better odds of successfully defending this important price level.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Additionally, technical indicators point towards a potential extended correction in the price of ETH towards the $1,790 support level. The market data also indicates resistance at the $1,920 level, with declining demand for decentralized applications on the Ethereum network and worsening macroeconomic conditions contributing to a bearish sentiment.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing bearish sentiment, with fluctuations in price, transaction volume, and network activity. The MACD signal consistently indicates a sell trend, suggesting a potential for further price declines in the near future. On the other hand, the news analyst report presents a more positive outlook, highlighting bullish technical indicators and potential price targets reaching $3,000 due to declining exchange balances and increasing staking deposits. However, regulatory uncertainties pose a risk to the market.

In light of these mixed signals, it is important to take a balanced and cautious approach to trading ETH. By synthesizing information from both reports, it is evident that a conservative trading strategy focused on long-term profitability and risk management is warranted. While short-term gains may be possible, the focus should be on sustainable profitability over time.

Considering the current market uncertainty and the need for a conservative approach, I would take a slightly bearish stance on ETH trading. My trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.3, reflecting a moderate level of caution in response to the mixed signals and potential risks in the market. This decision aims to mitigate risks and maximize profitability over the long term, aligning with the strategic approach outlined in the reflection analyst report.

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing a bearish trend, as indicated by the decrease in open price, total transactions, and total value transferred. The MACD signal consistently showing a sell trend further supports this bearish outlook. 

On the other hand, the news analyst report presents a mixed outlook for the ETH market, with potential positive factors such as the introduction of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs by HSBC Hong Kong, but also negative factors such as the presence of a significant short seller on GMX and concerns about the Shanghai upgrade.

In reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a cautious and balanced approach is necessary to navigate the mixed signals in the market. Long-term profitability, risk management, and adaptability to market fluctuations are key strategies for success. Given the current market conditions and the need for risk mitigation, a conservative trading approach is recommended to maximize profitability over the long term.

Considering the bearish trend in the on-chain report and the potential short-term risks highlighted in the news report, I would take a conservative approach and decide to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.5. This decision is based on the need to manage risk appropriately and prioritize long-term profitability in the face of market uncertainties.

In reflecting on the reports, it is clear that there are mixed signals in the market, with on-chain data pointing towards a bearish trend while news reports indicate a bullish outlook. This uncertainty emphasizes the importance of a cautious and balanced approach to trading, prioritizing long-term profitability over short-term gains. It is crucial to monitor key trends, such as on-chain data and news developments, to inform trading decisions and mitigate risks effectively.

Considering the current market uncertainty and the need for a conservative trading approach, I would take a neutral stance with a trading action of 0.0.

However, new records show that Hinman was repeatedly forewarned by colleagues that the speech would confuse markets.\n\nThe Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Lubin said, viewed Ether as a commodity. The three most valuable assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum and Tether, according to CFTC Chairman Rostin Benham, should be governed by his agency like commodities.\n\nGary Gensler, the current chairman of the SEC, has only publicly recognized Bitcoin as such and has refrained from declaring Ethereum to be either a security or a commodity. Legislation to clarify the situation is being drafted by Congressmen, including Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand, who have stated their agreement with the CFTC that Ether is a commodity alongside Bitcoin.

Earlier this month, Gensler‚Äôs hammer struck twice as the SEC filed landmark lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase for purportedly offering cryptocurrencies that the regulator deems to be unregistered securities.\n\nThe commission‚Äôs chairman has also hinted that ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, fell under this umbrella after the network‚Äôs monumental shift to a proof of stake consensus mechanism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Gensler wasn‚Äôt always so trenchant a detractor.

While various factors play into the volatility of cryptocurrency prices, the substantial sell-off by a particular "whale" is believed to have significantly contributed to Ethereum\'s decline in this instance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA "whale" in the crypto universe refers to an individual or entity that holds a large amount of a particular cryptocurrency. When such a player makes substantial trades, it often triggers notable price movements. In this case, an Ethereum whale strategically deposited 25,000 ETH (valued at approximately $47.24 million) to Binance, the popular crypto exchange platform, and withdrew 15.9 million USDT 12 hours later.\n\nThe smart whale who deposited 25K $ETH ($47.24M) to #Binance yesterday withdrew 16M $USDT again 9 hrs ago.\n\n\n\nThe drop in $ETH price 11 hrs ago was most likely due to the sell-off of this whale.\n\n\n\nAnd the whale may have ~8K $ETH ($14.7M) left unsold.https://t.co/EucQrT7C4w pic.twitter.com/Aogfv9vOdO ‚Äî Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 29, 2023\n\nRenowned for buying low and selling high, this crypto whale has maintained a perfect win rate for Ethereum trading over the past couple of months. This successful strategy, while profitable for the whale, has recently resulted in downward pressure on ETH\'s price.\n\nJust nine hours after the initial transaction, the whale proceeded to withdraw another 16 million USDT, further contributing to Ethereum\'s downward spiral. Analysts believe the sudden drop in Ethereum\'s price was largely attributed to this whale\'s substantial sell-off.\n\nWith approximately 8,000 ETH (roughly $14.7 million) yet to be sold, this influential whale\'s future trading activities could potentially exert additional selling pressure on Ethereum\'s market value. However, it is also crucial to note that crypto markets can be affected by a myriad of factors, including global economic trends, regulatory news and changes in investor sentiment.\n\nThis recent event underscores the amount of power and influence whales have on the cryptocurrency market.

"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing a bearish trend, as indicated by the decrease in open price, total transactions, and total value transferred. The MACD signal consistently showing a sell trend further supports this bearish outlook. 

On the other hand, the news analyst report presents a mixed outlook for the ETH market, with potential positive factors such as the introduction of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs by HSBC Hong Kong, but also negative factors such as the presence of a significant short seller on GMX and concerns about the Shanghai upgrade.

In reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a cautious and balanced approach is necessary to navigate the mixed signals in the market. Long-term profitability, risk management, and adaptability to market fluctuations are key strategies for success. Given the current market conditions and the need for risk mitigation, a conservative trading approach is recommended to maximize profitability over the long term.

Considering the bearish trend in the on-chain report and the potential short-term risks highlighted in the news report, I would take a conservative approach and decide to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.5. This decision is based on the need to manage risk appropriately and prioritize long-term profitability in the face of market uncertainties.
ACTION:

DAILY RETURN:
0.0040905923580398795
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the ETH market is currently experiencing a downward trend, with decreasing open prices, total transactions, and fluctuating total value transferred. The MACD signal remains at sell, indicating a bearish trend in the near future. On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights positive aspects of the Ethereum ecosystem, such as the positive regulatory environment in Zug, the growth of decentralized applications, and the transition to a proof of stake consensus mechanism, suggesting a bullish outlook for ETH.

In reflecting on the reports, it is clear that there are mixed signals in the market, with on-chain data pointing towards a bearish trend while news reports indicate a bullish outlook. This uncertainty emphasizes the importance of a cautious and balanced approach to trading, prioritizing long-term profitability over short-term gains. It is crucial to monitor key trends, such as on-chain data and news developments, to inform trading decisions and mitigate risks effectively.

Considering the current market uncertainty and the need for a conservative trading approach, I would take a neutral stance with a trading action of 0.0. This reflects a balanced approach to managing risk and maximizing profitability over time, rather than making hasty decisions based on short-term market fluctuations. By staying vigilant and prioritizing long-term strategies, I aim to navigate the volatile ETH market successfully and achieve sustainable profitability in the long run.
ACTION:
0.0
DAILY RETURN:
-0.011019460361685218
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain, news, and reflection analyst reports, it is clear that the overall sentiment in the ETH market is bearish in the short term. The on-chain data indicates a consistent decrease in key metrics, the news highlights regulatory challenges and technical indicators pointing towards a potential price correction, and the reflection report emphasizes the importance of a cautious and balanced approach to trading in the current market conditions.

Considering these factors, it is prudent to prioritize long-term profitability and risk management over short-term gains. The market trend for Ethereum is likely to continue on a bearish trajectory in the short term, with a potential further decline in price towards the $1,790 support level. Therefore, a conservative trading approach is warranted to navigate the current market uncertainty successfully.

Given the bearish sentiment and the need for risk mitigation, I would recommend a short-term selling strategy to capitalize on the potential further decline in ETH price. My trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.8, reflecting a high level of certainty in the bearish market trend and my strategic decision to manage risk appropriately. By prioritizing long-term strategies and remaining adaptable to market fluctuations, traders can navigate the volatile cryptocurrency market effectively and ensure sustainable profitability over time.

Not long ago, Ethereum founder VitalikButerin stressed the significance of Layer 3, saying that the architecture can optimize and improve the network. The heavy-hitting Layer 3 super public chain will link every blockchain to build a truly open, transparent, inclusive, fast and secure decentralized world.\n\n\n\n‚óé The congestion problem under the Ethereum boom needs to be solved\n\nAs the most mainstream smart contract platform, Ethereum is known for its security and decentralized characteristics, but it still lags behind in terms of scalability: Ethereum's current TPS (the number of transactions that can be processed per second) is between 10 and 15, and the supply is insufficient and the demand is strong, resulting in high fees determined by bidding, and each transaction needs to spend several dollars to tens of dollars.\n\n\n\nÂæÆ‰ø°ÂõæÁâá_20230628162753\n\nIn other words, on the first layer of the Ethereum blockchain, the growing demand for network usage has led to network congestion and pushed up transaction costs.Increased storage, network speed, and throughput are fundamental to meaningful mass adoption of Ethereum. Decentralization, Security, Scalability, the three can only choose two, which is also known as the blockchain impossible triangle. Ethereum's initial choice was to abandon scalability and bring it into line with the most important values of Web3.0. But if you implement scalability in a clean and crude way, you sacrifice security or decentralization! In this context, the congestion problem under the Ethereum boom needs to be solved.\n\n\n\n‚óéLayer 3 brings the perfect solution for Ethereum cross-chain scaling\n\nThe congestion problem of the Ethereum boom caught the world's attention, and Scaling was the solution - and that's where Layer 3 came into being. Layer 3 has been actively looking for Ethereum scalability solutions, and after the full research and development of the technical team, it has determined the cross-chain expansion route combining on-chain and off-chain expansion. Layer 3 combines cross-chain technology with Layer 1 and Layer 2 expansion solutions to bring a new chain expansion solution, support cross-chain interaction between major public chains, complete block transactions faster with lower GAS fees, and bring users a silky transaction experience.\n\n\n\nLayer 3, as an Ethereum expansion solution, aims to solve the congestion problem of Ethereum and realize the decentralized, low-cost and high-concurrency Ethereum ecosystem that people yearn for. It can be said that Layer 3 public chains start from the underlying algorithms and consensus protocols to help different public chains connect with each other and exchange value. Layer 3 public chain From the architecture design, to ensure that every public chain, even if there is no first-mover advantage, can be mirrored on the Layer 3 public chain, so that thousands of people understand and use.\n\n\n\nThe Layer 3 public chain's original series of core technologies build a cross-chain ecosystem integrating public chain, wallet, decentralized transaction, decentralized application and other layers to serve finance, artificial intelligence, metauniverse and other fields.\n\n\n\nIn short, the Layer 3 super public chain brings a new paradigm of the digital economy.\n\n\n\nFrom the perspective of technical architecture, Layer 3, like Layer 2, also contains the application Layer, and Layer 3 has better cross-chain interoperability, which means that there will be a lot of use cases that can be migrated to Layer 3.\n\n\n\nIn addition, for those types of use cases that require greater transaction throughput support and strong demand for further reducing network use costs, such as decentralized exchanges and blockchain games, transaction efficiency can also be improved on Layer 3 and real cost reduction and efficiency can be experienced.\n\n\n\nLayer 3's Ethereum cross-chain scaling solution has been tested to be the most secure and widely used scaling solution.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the ETH market is currently experiencing a downward trend, with decreasing open prices, total transactions, and fluctuating total value transferred. The MACD signal remains at sell, indicating a bearish trend in the near future. On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights positive aspects of the Ethereum ecosystem, such as the positive regulatory environment in Zug, the growth of decentralized applications, and the transition to a proof of stake consensus mechanism, suggesting a bullish outlook for ETH.

In reflecting on the reports, it is clear that there are mixed signals in the market, with on-chain data pointing towards a bearish trend while news reports indicate a bullish outlook. This uncertainty emphasizes the importance of a cautious and balanced approach to trading, prioritizing long-term profitability over short-term gains. It is crucial to monitor key trends, such as on-chain data and news developments, to inform trading decisions and mitigate risks effectively.

Considering the current market uncertainty and the need for a conservative trading approach, I would take a neutral stance with a trading action of 0.0. This reflects a balanced approach to managing risk and maximizing profitability over time, rather than making hasty decisions based on short-term market fluctuations. By staying vigilant and prioritizing long-term strategies, I aim to navigate the volatile ETH market successfully and achieve sustainable profitability in the long run.
ACTION:
0.0
DAILY RETURN:
-0.011019460361685218
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain, news, and reflection analyst reports, it is clear that the overall sentiment in the ETH market is bearish in the short term. The on-chain data indicates a consistent decrease in key metrics, the news highlights regulatory challenges and technical indicators pointing towards a potential price correction, and the reflection report emphasizes the importance of a cautious and balanced approach to trading in the current market conditions.

Considering these factors, it is prudent to prioritize long-term profitability and risk management over short-term gains. The market trend for Ethereum is likely to continue on a bearish trajectory in the short term, with a potential further decline in price towards the $1,790 support level. Therefore, a conservative trading approach is warranted to navigate the current market uncertainty successfully.

Given the bearish sentiment and the need for risk mitigation, I would recommend a short-term selling strategy to capitalize on the potential further decline in ETH price. My trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.8, reflecting a high level of certainty in the bearish market trend and my strategic decision to manage risk appropriately. By prioritizing long-term strategies and remaining adaptable to market fluctuations, traders can navigate the volatile cryptocurrency market effectively and ensure sustainable profitability over time.
ACTION:

DAILY RETURN:
-0.00015708549421411533
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the ETH market is currently bearish, with a downward trend in prices and fluctuating transaction volumes. The MACD signal consistently indicating a sell trend further supports this bearish sentiment. 

The news analyst report highlights the uncertainty surrounding the regulatory classification of Ethereum and the impact of market manipulation by whales on price volatility. These factors contribute to the short-term unpredictability of the market and emphasize the need for careful monitoring of regulatory developments and whale activity.

The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a cautious and balanced trading approach, focusing on long-term profitability and risk management. It suggests that a conservative trading strategy, prioritizing risk mitigation and strategic decision-making, is essential in navigating the current bearish market sentiment.

Taking into account all three reports, it is clear that the overall market trend for ETH is bearish in the short term. Therefore, a conservative and long-term trading strategy is recommended to maximize profitability and manage risk effectively.

Based on this analysis, I would take a trading action with a confidence level of 0.3, indicating a cautious approach in the current bearish market.

"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain, news, and reflection analyst reports, it is clear that the overall sentiment in the ETH market is bearish in the short term. The on-chain data indicates a consistent decrease in key metrics, the news highlights regulatory challenges and technical indicators pointing towards a potential price correction, and the reflection report emphasizes the importance of a cautious and balanced approach to trading in the current market conditions.

Considering these factors, it is prudent to prioritize long-term profitability and risk management over short-term gains. The market trend for Ethereum is likely to continue on a bearish trajectory in the short term, with a potential further decline in price towards the $1,790 support level. Therefore, a conservative trading approach is warranted to navigate the current market uncertainty successfully.

Given the bearish sentiment and the need for risk mitigation, I would recommend a short-term selling strategy to capitalize on the potential further decline in ETH price. My trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.8, reflecting a high level of certainty in the bearish market trend and my strategic decision to manage risk appropriately. By prioritizing long-term strategies and remaining adaptable to market fluctuations, traders can navigate the volatile cryptocurrency market effectively and ensure sustainable profitability over time.

The news analyst report highlights the uncertainty surrounding the regulatory classification of Ethereum and the impact of market manipulation by whales on price volatility. These factors contribute to the short-term unpredictability of the market and emphasize the need for careful monitoring of regulatory developments and whale activity.

The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a cautious and balanced trading approach, focusing on long-term profitability and risk management. It suggests that a conservative trading strategy, prioritizing risk mitigation and strategic decision-making, is essential in navigating the current bearish market sentiment.

Taking into account all three reports, it is clear that the overall market trend for ETH is bearish in the short term. Therefore, a conservative and long-term trading strategy is recommended to maximize profitability and manage risk effectively.

Trustworthy stakers are much less likely to actually get slashed.‚Äù\n\nSreeram Kaanan, the founder of EigenLayer, explained there are ‚Äúcomplex risks‚Äù with restaking, and it is important to take a ‚Äúconstrained approach in building restaking.‚Äú\n\n‚ÄúConstraints being what is really good for the ecosystem, and having constraints on building what new innovation can be unleashed based on this concept,‚Äù he stated.\n\nPanelists on the June 29 Bankless podcast episode.

This step comes as the L2 ecosystem continues to witness an influx of projects and protocols.\n\nAccording to L2Beat data, the total value of assets locked on L2 service providers has surged by over 190% in the past year, standing at $9.78 billion at the time of writing. Arbitrum leads the market with a 60% share and a total value locked (TVL) of $5.87 billion.\n\nENS domain name registrations experienced robust growth in Q2 2021. Dune Analytics data shows monthly ENS domain name registrations totalling 79,463 last quarter. June, marked by a significant drop in gas fees on the Ethereum Network, recorded the highest number of registrations during the quarter with 35,932 ENS name registrations.\n\nWhile .eth name registrations ended Q2 with a surge, primary ENS name registrations saw a notable decline. A primary ENS name is a unique domain name registered and associated with an Ethereum address on the ENS platform.

With the latest move of introducing Layer 2 interoperability, ENS Labs takes a significant stride towards improving the operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness of managing ENS domains.\n\nThis development arrives amidst a growing trend of Layer 2 adoption across the blockchain sphere, an effort to counteract the scalability and performance bottlenecks often associated with the Ethereum mainnet.

Consequently, in a recent interview, Buterin stated that he would only stake a limited amount of coins to ensure the network is distributed and remain robust against malicious agents who might try to take over the platform, reversing transactions.\n\nVitalik Buterin Has Doubts On Ethereum Staking\n\nButerin has raised concerns about the potential risks of ETH staking through third-party infrastructure, specifically regarding the exposure of private keys and the danger it poses to his entire stake. He believes that implementing a multi-signature system could provide better protection. However, the current process is more difficult to set up, leading to his increased caution.\n\nIn a multi-sig system, users have their private key to sign transactions. A specific number of signatures must be provided to approve a transaction, which varies based on the Ethereum wallet‚Äôs configuration. This setup boosts security and reduces the risk of unauthorized access to funds.\n\nDuring the Bankless Podcast, the co-founder explains:\n\nProbably the biggest reason why I personally am not just staking all of my ETH, that I‚Äôm instead staking a fairly small portion, is because if you stake your ETH, it has to be all out, like the keys that access it have to be public on some system that‚Äôs online, and for safety, it has to be a multi-sig, and multi-sigs for staking are still fairly difficult to set up, and it gets complicated in a bunch of ways.\n\nETH Prices Stable Below $2,000\n\nHis remarks have generated a lot of discussion. Most critics are concerned about the entire security framework of Ethereum. After shifting from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake system, Ethereum relies on a network of validators who have to stake at least 32 ETH for a chance to approve a block of transactions and earn block rewards and transaction fees. These validators are also needed to secure the network; without them, the blockchain will be susceptible to attacks.\n\nAccording to on-chain data, there are over 643,000 validators spread across the globe who have staked over 20.5 million ETH. On average, each validator has staked 32.17 ETH. Notably, the validator count has steadily risen over the years, and the number of ETH staked has sharply increased despite the recent upgrade permitting stakers to unlock their coins.\n\nCharles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano and one of the original co-founders of Ethereum, said he was ‚Äúlost for words,‚Äù clarifying that all their ADA is staked as expected in a ‚Äúproperly designed proof-of-stake system.‚Äù\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH prices remain firm and weren‚Äôt affected by Buterin‚Äôs comments.

Its immediate downside is protected by the recently reclaimed ascending trendline support, but if declines intensify, it would be prudent for investors to anticipate a minor and brief retracement to stronger support at $1,800 and $1,650, respectively.\n\nHow Will Investors React To Ethereum Price Lifting Above $2,000?\n\nThe sudden interest in the crypto market by institutional investors like Blackrock, Fidelity Investments, and Cathie Wood was a substantial boost for the crypto market in June.\n\nBlackrock‚Äôs decision to apply for a spot Bitcoin ETF has, within a few weeks, encouraged other players like Cathie Wood and Fidelity to cast their nets with the hope of operating a similar product in the US.\n\nMarket participants believe Blackrock has a higher chance of getting the coveted approval, which the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has managed to avoid for several years, citing market volatility and manipulation, among other bottlenecks.\n\nAs more institutional investors stream into the market, major digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum are bound to react positively. Retail investors also see this as a signal that the market is on an upward trajectory.\n\nEthereum‚Äôs sturdiness from support at $1,650 can mainly be attributed to the rise in interest from institutional and retail investors combined.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that with Ethereum holding above $1,900 and particularly on top of the dotted rising trendline, the path with the least resistance gradually turns to the upside. That said, the anticipated breakout above $2,000 is, at the time of writing, a matter of when and not if.\n\nEvaluating Ethereum Price Bullish Outlook\n\nTwo indicators affirm the bullish outlook for Ethereum price, starting with a buy signal from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator. This call to buy Ether triggered on June 20, has managed to keep investor interest intact, but resistance at $2,000 is the biggest stumbling block, at least for now.\n\nA second bullish signal emanates from the SuperTrend indicator, which like the MACD, flipped in support of an Ethereum uptrend on June 20.

Discover SCENE\n\nDespite certain limitations and potential risks, the idea of using Ethereum (ETH) as a layer-2 for the Solana (SOL) blockchain is not as farfetched as it may seem, according to Anatoly Yakovenko, the co-founder of Solana Labs.\n\nIn a series of tweets on Sunday, Yakovenko took a closer look at how such an integration could take shape, suggesting that the technical collaboration, is ‚Äúprobably more likely than you might think at first glance.‚Äù\n\nLayer-2 solutions aim to address scalability issues faced by blockchains like Ethereum, which have experienced congestion and high transaction fees during periods of increased activity. Solana, known for its high throughput and low transaction costs, promises a blockchain platform capable of efficiently accommodating various decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPointing out that these scaling solutions ‚Äúare bridge protocols that provide one-way security,‚Äù Yakovenko argues that Ethereum being a layer-2 for Solana would mean that holders of SOL assets on the Ethereum blockchain would have ‚Äúfinality guarantees‚Äù of being able to safely exit back to Solana even in cases of transaction double spends or an invalid state transition.\n\nWould it be possible for ethereum to be a @solana L2? Probably more likely than you might think at first glance. L2s are bridge protocols that provide one way security.

Some examples of faults, per Yakovenko, include conflicting SPVs for the root, invalid root computation, and censorship.\n\nLimitations and risks of Solana\'s ETH-based L2\n\nThe Solana Labs co-founder also highlighted the limitations and potential risks associated with this integration, saying that while it would be safe to hold SOL assets on the Ethereum blockchain, it will not be safe ‚Äúto lend them or maintain positions against them.‚Äù\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne key risk is the possibility of an Ethereum fault or a contentious social consensus fork within the Ethereum network. In such a scenario, the representations of Solana assets held on Ethereum could become separated from the consensus fork, resulting in a situation where these assets become effectively worthless.\n\nIt would be safe to hold solana assets on ethereum, but not safe to lend them or maintain positions against them. This is because once there is an ethereum fault, ethereum state on solana becomes separated from ethereum the social consensus fork.

While central limit order books (CLOBs) would likely remain functional, automated market makers (AMMs), and non-flash loan borrowing and lending protocols could face limitations or challenges, potentially leading to inefficiencies or constraints in liquidity provision and trading.\n\nClobs are ok, AMMs and non flash loan borrow lending protocols are not. ‚Äî toly üá∫üá∏ (@aeyakovenko) July 2, 2023\n\nYakovenko‚Äôs proposal came hot on the heels of Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin lamenting about how U.S. regulators are targeting various crypto projects, including Solana, which the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in its recent lawsuit against Binance labeled as unregistered securities.\n\n‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt deserve it, and if Ethereum ends up ‚Äòwinning‚Äô through all other blockchains getting kicked off exchanges, that‚Äôs not an honorable way to win, and in the long term probably isn‚Äôt even a victory,‚Äù Buterin tweeted last week.\n\nAD\n\nAD'}]

However, in practice, NEAR believes the overall scaling achieved by rollups collectively has been somewhat disappointing, barely surpassing what a single rollup can offer.\n\nHowever, data from L2 analysis platform L2Beat offers a contrasting view due to increased L2 activity over the past year, as shown in the chart below.\n\nFurther, reviewing the top 10 Ethereum L2s shows Arbitrum One and zkSync Era closing in on Ethereum‚Äôs monthly transaction count. Additionally, Immutable X and Arbitrum Nova have surpassed Ethereum‚Äôs growth in average transactions per second (TPS) over seven days. Notably, Ethereum had a higher active TPS than any L2 scaling solution on the network on July 3.\n\n# Name Past Day TPS 7D Change Max Daily TPS 30D Count Data Source 1 Ethereum 12.29 6.48% 22.37 (2022 Dec 09) 31.45 M Blockchain RPC 2 Arbitrum One 9.69 -4.17% 31.64 (2023 Mar 23) 24.81 M Blockchain RPC 3 zkSync Era 8.63 -14.74% 12.00 (2023 May 16) 22.27 M Blockchain RPC 4 OP Mainnet 6.00 -12.97% 9.26 (2023 Jan 12) 14.82 M Blockchain RPC 5 dYdX 3.09 -38.54% 11.45 (2022 Feb 15) 9.42 M Closed API 6 Immutable X 2.01 7.47% 39.35 (2022 Mar 11) 5.67 M Closed API 7 Starknet 1.79 -9.17% 3.05 (2023 May 16) 4.61 M Explorer API 8 Arbitrum Nova 1.34 18.15% 10.93 (2023 Apr 27) 2.99 M Blockchain RPC 9 ApeX 0.95 2.27% 1.38 (2023 Apr 13) 2.68 M Closed API 10 zkSync Lite 0.89 -27.20% 3.29 (2023 Mar 21) 2.52 M Explorer API 11 Polygon zkEVM 0.64 -5.13% 0.82 (2023 Jun 13) 1.34 M Blockchain RPC\n\nData from L2Beat.com\n\nHowever, the primary cause of NEAR‚Äôs suggested lackluster performance is attributed to the fact that popular Ethereum decentralized applications (dApps) operate on nearly all rollups, resulting in similar transactions being ‚Äòduplicated‚Äô across different rollups.\n\nNEAR‚Äôs Shard-Centric Approach\n\nNEAR Protocol has, conversely, opted to tackle scalability through sharding, which partitions the network into distinct segments built directly into the protocol. According to NEARWEEK, each shard in NEAR‚Äôs architecture can be likened to an optimistic rollup in Ethereum‚Äôs approach.\n\nThe key advantage of NEAR‚Äôs sharding approach lies in its composability, which allows applications on one shard to interact with applications on another shard natively. This homogeneous sharding model allows applications to interact in the same way regardless if they‚Äôre deployed on the same shard, relieving developers from deciding which shard to deploy their applications.\n\nAdditionally, NEAR‚Äôs sharding model offers faster transaction finality, typically within two to three seconds, outperforming the extended finality times in the rollup universe.\n\nWhile NEAR Protocol does not list its real-time TPS on the block explorer, it can be calculated based on data from the most recent blocks. A CryptoSlate analysis of transactions from the NEAR block explorer showed an average TPS of roughly 5.7 transactions per second on July 4. This snapshot of NEAR‚Äôs TPS aligns with the top five L2s on the Ethereum network. The NEAR community foresees the protocol‚Äôs potential through sharding will reach 100,000 TPS in the future.\n\nContrasting Design Philosophies\n\nThe different scaling approaches adopted by Ethereum and NEAR highlight their contrasting design philosophies. While Ethereum prioritizes resilience, maintaining a simple L1 protocol design, NEARWEEK stated NEAR Protocol leans towards a simplified user experience, taking on additional protocol complexity to ensure a superior UX.\n\nFurthermore, it‚Äôs important to note that NEAR is not aiming to be ‚Äújust an L1‚Äù as it seeks to function as a Blockchain Operating System (BOS), providing a universal layer for navigating and discovering open web experiences. Through the BOS, NEAR aims to\n\n‚Äúempower developers and users from various blockchains, including Ethereum Layer 2s, to construct and utilise applications across a multitude of blockchain ecosystems.‚Äù\n\nMore details on NE...'}]

At present, artists can often sell their artworks at significantly higher prices on Ethereum, which also offers greater visibility for artists.\n\n"By bringing communities together and showing artworks side by side, regardless of the chain they were minted on, we aim to elevate generative art," Charlie Middleton, the creative director at fxhash, told Decrypt. ‚ÄúThe chain doesn\'t matter.

The platform has facilitated the movement of approximately $40 million to $45 million, with the lion\'s share of this amount going to the artists.\n\nThe team at fxhash is currently hard at work on the Ethereum integration, with the launch of fxhash 2.0 slated for after the summer.\n\nThis will likely come with a UI and UX overhaul, too, and there are plans for events, both online and in-person, to celebrate the launch.\n\n"Right now we\'ve got our sights focused on an event happening in Berlin, which is related to the hackathon we\'ve just started,‚Äù said Middleton. ‚ÄúAs we get closer to the launch, we\'ll have a clearer idea of what we can plan."\n\nIn a world where the chain often matters more than the art, fxhash is striving to shift the focus back to where it belongs: on the artists and their creations.\n\n"Our goal was always to build tools allowing artists and collectors to live out their passion for generative art,‚Äù fxhash COO Paul Viktor Schmidt told Decrypt. ‚ÄúWe have always prioritized pushing the boundaries of what is possible, and will continue to do so.‚Äù'}, {'id': 4, 'time': 'Wed, 05 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Will ERC 6551 transform Ethereum metaverses with NFT-owned wallets? - CryptoSlate', 'content': 'The proposed ERC 6551 token standard for NFTs is generating interest among crypto enthusiasts, as it would enable digital assets to own other tokens, a development that could significantly transform the NFT and metaverse landscape.\n\nSpeaking to Laura Shin on a recent episode of the Unchained Podcast, Benny Giang and Jayden Windle, two of the authors of the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) for ERC 6551, stated this new standard allows NFTs to own other tokens, essentially equipping them with their own ‚Äòwallets.‚Äô\n\nWhat is ERC 6551?\n\nThe token standard proposal, introduced in February, focuses on creating a system that assigns every ERC-721 (non-fungible token) a smart contract account. This will allow these tokens to own assets and interact with applications without changing existing ERC-721 smart contracts or infrastructure.\n\nThis system comprises two main components: a permissionless registry for deploying token-bound accounts and a standard implementation interface.\n\nThe registry will deploy a unique smart contract account for each ERC-721 token, allowing the token to interact with the blockchain, record transaction history, and own on-chain assets. Control of each token-bound account is delegated to the owner of the ERC-721 token, allowing the owner to initiate on-chain actions on behalf of their token.\n\nThe proposal seeks to be maximally backward compatible with existing non-fungible token contracts. It also uses EIP-155 chain IDs to uniquely identify ERC-721 tokens, allowing for optional support of multi-chain token-bound accounts.\n\nDeveloper reaction\n\nThe initial developer discussion for the proposal centered on potential security implications, such as the risk of duplicating registries and the need for trust verification. Suggestions included creating a registry for broad registration of account Implementations and making the proposal‚Äôs registry canonical due to its permissionless nature.\n\nThe proposal‚Äôs potential implications for reducing airdrop costs were also highlighted, along with a discussion that also raised security worries about adding metadata to the NFT registry.\n\nMore recently, with over 160 comments from Ethereum developers, concerns were raised about the proposal still being in the ‚ÄòDraft‚Äô status, potentially subjecting it to significant changes. Finally, there were discussions about finalizing the naming of functions and the potential impacts on those implementing the EIP.\n\nBenefits of ERC 6551\n\nAs Giang explained on the Unchained Podcast, ERC 6551 was sparked by a simple query ‚Äì\n\n‚ÄúWhat if we had a project that was an NFT project that had a character, and sometimes we call this a PFP (Profile Picture) project, right? Our main question was like, why can‚Äôt you change the clothing or the aesthetic of this PFP character?‚Äù\n\nThis question led to the inception of the ERC 6551 standard, allowing NFTs to own other tokens, essentially giving them their own ‚Äòwallets.‚Äô\n\nGiang further added,\n\n‚ÄúDo you pursue the off-chain way where you build a database, and you have all this kind of centralization where you could render the NFT? Or you go the on-chain way, which is like every item an NFT can be applicable on-chain as a transaction. So through this kind of journey, as we were feeling in the dark in the last eight or nine months, we realized that there was a potential solution.‚Äù\n\nGiang and Windle also discussed the pros and cons of pursuing the on-chain or off-chain method for applying every item an NFT could own as a transaction.\n\nThey concluded that the ERC 6551 standard was a potential solution to the limitations presented by previous attempts to standardize NFTs owning assets, such as the necessity for custom logic in their smart contract. The ERC 6551 standard overcomes these restrictions, granting NFTs the same rights as Ethereum users, allowing them to own assets and take action.\n\nThe podcast guests also highlighted that while ERC 721, ERC 1155, and soul-bound tokens exist as ways to own items on Ethereum, ERC 6551 is not a token standard in the traditional sense because it gives every existing ERC 721 its own wallet, thus unlocking a new layer of compatibility for NFTs.\n\nUse cases of ERC 6551\n\nThe implementation of ERC 6551 has created exciting prospects across various industries, according to the EIP authors. It allows NFTs to own assets and perform actions autonomously, potentially beneficial in gaming, DAOs, infrastructure and tooling, and social networks.\n\nGiang mentioned several projects like ‚ÄòSapiens,‚Äô ‚ÄòFuel Worlds,‚Äô and ‚ÄòParallel Trading Card Game,‚Äô leveraging the standard for gamification. Giang commented, ‚ÄúIt makes a lot of sense for a decentralized game inventory.‚Äù Such games, thus, allow characters to have their own wallets and act independently in the game.\n\nAccording to Giang, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, or DAOs, such as ‚ÄòStation‚Äô and ‚ÄòDow House,‚Äô are also exploring this standard to monitor engagement within their communities.

People are literally burning their money to increase gas fees for everyone else.‚Äù\n\nQedk, a smart contract engineer at Polygon (MATIC), confirmed this, adding that the ERC-20 token would make users spend more gas if they want to mint more tokens.\n\nAccording to tweets from the project founder, Jack Levin, VMPX is the first ever BRC-20 token linked to Ethereum‚Äôs ERC-20 token. The project‚Äôs website states that its supply is 108.62 million but fails to provide additional information about its utility.\n\nVMPX consumed nearly $3M in gas fees\n\nMeanwhile, Etherscan data shows that the VMPX mint contract consumed over 1,500 ETH, around $3 million, in gas fees during the last 24 hours. This represents around 30% of all the gas fees spent during the period, above those generated by the Uniswap (UNI) decentralized exchange.\n\nHarrison, the co-founder of PopPunk, pointed out that those who minted the token paid gas fees as high as 1.36ETH.\n\nEigenPhi, a DeFi data platform, corroborated Harrison‚Äôs statement, adding that an average mint transaction of VMPX was 0.167ETH, around $317 per tx.\n\nThis high network activity saw Ethereum network fees jump to as high as 76.3 Gwei during the reporting period, according to Ultrasound.money.\n\nA representative from Push Protocol, the Ethereum messaging service, told CryptoSlate:\n\nGas fees still play a vital role in interacting with Ethereum and is probably one of the reason projects are moving to L2s or prefering off-chain yet verifiable executions.‚Äù\n\nMentioned in this article'}, {'id': 7, 'time': 'Thu, 06 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum Users Have Been Burning ETH To Mint VMPX Tokens - Yahoo Finance', 'content': "The smart contracts that account for the highest transaction fees on Ethereum are generally household names, so an unknown project topping the charts is an unusual event.\n\nThat‚Äôs what happened this week when users racing to use a smart contract to mint a token called VMPX pushed gas prices on Ethereum to their highest levels since May.\n\nEthereum Users Have Been Burning ETH To Mint VMPX Tokens\n\nVMPX is an asset designed to connect the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains, according to Jack Levin, the founder of the XEN ecosystem, a token with ties to VMPX.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre developing one of the first bridges between the world's largest crypto ecosystems, Bitcoin and Ethereum,‚Äù he told The Defiant, adding that holders will be able to stake VMPX in order to earn fees when people transfer assets between the two blockchains.\n\nVMPX led all contracts in terms of burned ETH as of July 6, putting it ahead of typical gas guzzlers like Uniswap and the USDT stablecoin.\n\nEthereum Users Have Been Burning ETH To Mint VMPX Tokens\n\n$90M Burned\n\nProjects in the XEN ecosystem have spiked gas before.\n\nXENTorrent, another project in the ecosystem, accounted for 11% of gas usage in April.

The news articles highlight the significant impact of the newly launched ERC-20 token VMPX on the Ethereum network, leading to a spike in gas fees and ETH burns. This high network activity has caused Ethereum fees to rise and has drawn attention to the potential drawbacks of the token's minting contract. Additionally, external factors such as macroeconomic events, regulatory developments, and declining total value locked in Ethereum's smart contracts may contribute to resistance in Ether's price breaking $1,970.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nNoted cryptocurrency analyst Benjamin Cowen recently shared a cryptic chart that has sparked debate among his followers. The chart, which appears to be a reverse representation of the Ethereum (ETH) to Bitcoin (BTC) pair, has left followers pondering its significance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the Twitter post, Cowen, well-known for his incisive crypto analyses, did not explicitly mention the chart\'s name. However, he posed a simple question to his followers: "Is this bullish or bearish?" The enigmatic chart and the question have since provoked considerable speculation within the community.\n\nThe crux of the debate revolves around the interpretation of the ETH/BTC chart. A bullish ETH/BTC chart implies that Ethereum\'s value is set to appreciate against Bitcoin. In contrast, a bearish chart suggests that Bitcoin will outperform Ethereum. In the broader perspective, a bullish ETH/BTC chart could also be indicative of an impending surge of volatility on the crypto market.\n\nOver the past weeks, the ETH/BTC chart has shown a downward trend, which could indicate that Bitcoin has been outperforming Ethereum in the crypto race. However, this trend seems to be flattening out, which could potentially suggest a changing dynamic between the two leading cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhile the intention behind Cowen\'s post remains a mystery, it has undeniably succeeded in generating discussion and speculation among crypto enthusiasts. The ETH/BTC pair has long been viewed as an important metric in the crypto space, providing insight into the relative performance of the two largest cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn case of a breakthrough on ETH/BTC, we might see a surge of volatility on the cryptocurrency market, especially in the DeFi and NFT sectors.

Discover SCENE\n\nSix months after launching a protocol that lets people mint NFT-like media assets on the Bitcoin blockchain, the Ordinals space is rapidly evolving. Not only are new products springing up one after another, but the Ordinals-based BRC-20 tokens are now expanding onto none other than Ethereum, the dominant NFT and token ecosystem.\n\nTwo of the largest BRC-20 tokens on the market, ORDI and OXBT, have partnered with Emblem‚Äîa tool that lets users store tokens across blockchains without need for a bridge‚Äîto release BRC-20 Curated Collections.\n\n‚ÄúThis should be considered a day in which BRC-20s began exploring what their asset class is,‚Äù said Jake Gallen, who is in charge of NFT strategy and product at Emblem.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n‚¨õÔ∏èüüß $ORDI and $OXBT MEGATHREAD üüß‚¨õÔ∏è üöÄ VAULTING IS NOW LIVE üöÄ üî∏ How to Mint\n\nüî∏ Where to Trade\n\nüî∏ Vaulting Mechanics\n\nüî∏ Details, Info, Integrations, and Partnerships pic.twitter.com/AANoZjTVxs ‚Äî Emblem Vault (@EmblemVault) July 6, 2023\n\nBRC-20 tokens use the Ordinals protocol to generate what are effectively fungible tokens built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. Broadly, they‚Äôve been used thus far to create a wide variety of meme tokens, with the total market cap of all BRC-20s briefly nearing $1 billion in May before falling sharply since.\n\nGallen told Decrypt that the BRC-20 Curated Collections are important ‚Äúbecause we can now test what type of asset BRC-20s are most closely related to.‚Äù He‚Äôs looking forward to ‚Äúhow the community views them,‚Äù and whether they want to trade them like fungible tokens ‚Äúor want some variety.‚Äù\n\nHe teamed with Adam McBride, colleague and self-proclaimed NFT archaeologist, to share a video deep dive earlier this week about the collection launch. An official launch was pegged for next week, but the functionality is already live and the resulting NFTs are being traded on the OpenSea and Blur marketplaces.\n\nAccording to McBride, the innovation at play with the new partnership is to sidestep traditional cross-chain bridges. He explained that ‚Äúbefore, users would send their BRC-20s to a Bitcoin wallet, which then would mint new ERC-20s on Ethereum.‚Äù\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEmblem‚Äôs solution, created in-house, is to create specialized vaults. Before Ordinals, Emblem vaults were used to transfer digital artwork minted on other Bitcoin-related protocols (like Counterparty) over to Ethereum, where they were newly minted as ERC-721 NFTs. The Rare Pepe collection is a prominent example.\n\nIn this case, with Ordinals-based BRC-20 tokens, users send their ORDI or OXBT to a vault which stores the private keys and holds the tokens. Then, using a single ERC-721 token, users will mint their Bitcoin-based NFT on Ethereum.\n\nIn essence, ‚Äúthe BRC-20 sits inside a Taproot wallet, which sits inside an NFT,‚Äù said Gallen, explaining that ‚Äúthe NFT (which is an ERC-721 token) is the one doing all the traveling.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm super excited to see how the Ethereum marketplace will react to this,‚Äù said McBride. ‚ÄúThis will bring a level of ownership which is far more superior than what already exists, unlocking a bunch of use cases like farming, lending, and other stuff that is built out on Ethereum smart contracts.‚Äù\n\nThe creator of BRC-20s and ORDI in particular, pseudonymous on-chain data enthusiast Domo, did not reply to a request for comment. According to Gallen, however, Domo ‚Äúis really excited to get to show his creation to Ethereum,‚Äù adding that ‚Äúgetting those tokens to OpenSea and Blur is huge.‚Äù\n\nGallen told Decrypt that the Emblem team has interacted more with ORDI builders than holders, whereas they are in direct contact with the OXBT community‚Äîled by the pseudonymous BitGod‚Äîsince it is more ETH-native, "so the interest in ETH-denominated trading is much higher."\n\nNonetheless, Gallen said that Emblem‚Äôs team ‚Äúbelieves Bitcoin can equal or overtake Ethereum in NFT trading volume, but with its own culture and style.‚Äù'}, {'id': 3, 'time': 'Fri, 07 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum, Bitcoin Choose Different Tradeoffs But Both Are Valuable -- Vitalik Buterin - CCN.com', 'content': 'Key Takeaways\n\nVitalik Buterin highlights the pros and cons between Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nEthereum co-founder highlights both BTC and ETH‚Äôs ‚Äúcore commitments to values‚Äù during Twitter Space.\n\nButerin also notes that Bitcoin and Ethereum don‚Äôt execute privacy very well.\n\nVitalik Buterin highlighted fundamental differences between the core design of Bitcoin and its smart contract pioneering predecessor Ethereum having trade-offs during a widely-tuned-into Twitter Space on July 6 .\n\nButerin, who co-founded Ethereum alongside eight other influential cryptocurrency developers, spoke at length with Bitcoin advocates Eric Wall and Udi Wertheimer about the technical and cultural nuances of either protocol.\n\n‚ÄúI think they‚Äôre definitely different experiments in terms of the culture and unavoidable trade offs that they‚Äôre making and that‚Äôs something that I‚Äôve only really come to realize over time.‚Äù\n\nButerin believes there is great value in Bitcoin and Ethereum continuing to co-exist, while admitting he had separated the technical and cultural aspects as best he could\n\n‚ÄúWhen I was starting with Ethereum I was looking at them as a kind of technical\n\nsystems and cultural systems somewhat separately. I had my beliefs on culture, that maximalism is crazy.‚Äù\n\nButerin said he had focused on taking a system from Bitcoin, which was fairly basic, and creating a more programmable system that mirrors ‚Äúhow computers evolved‚Äù.\n\nFundamental System Choices\n\nWith technological and cultural aspects intermingled in the development of both Bitcoin and Ethereum, Buterin highlighted the inevitable trade-offs of these systems.\n\n‚ÄúThere are points at which you have to make certain choices. Like if you make a system that supports more functionality, then any kind of functionality that you support ends up having risks, right?\n\nButerin said that extensive functionality requires protocol complexity, but functionality itself can introduce risks to a blockchain system.\n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs an example of something that we saw during the last few years.‚Äù\n\nProof-of-Work vs Proof-of-Stake\n\nEthereum, which originally employed Bitcoin‚Äôs proof-of-work consensus algorithm, shifted to proof-of-stake consensus in 2022 during the highly anticipated Merge.\n\nThe change in its core consensus protocol saw stakers introduced as the new ‚Äòminers‚Äô of the network. Staking 32 ETH is required to be a validator, which then receives rewards for processing transactions and maintaining the network.\n\nThe change also caused a split within the Ethereum community as Buterin highlighted, referring to the Ethereum DAO fork of 2016 which caused a fork in the chain, leaving ETH as we know it today and Ethereum Classic (ETC) as two separate chains.\n\n‚ÄúA lot of the people who were in favor of a more purist approach toward immutability ended up\n\ngoing to Ethereum Classic and people who are much stronger proof of work proponents.‚Äù\n\nValuable Experiments\n\nButerin believes that many of the ‚Äúsubtle choices‚Äù made by both protocols in terms of functionality end up providing value and continue to co exist.\n\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs just like a lot of these subtle choices that both platforms have made that like really go beyond the question of being general purpose or not trying to be general purpose?‚Äù\n\nHighlighting a plethora of differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum which ended up in either protocols ‚Äúchoosing different trade offs‚Äù down the line.\n\n‚ÄúThe result of all this is that we have these two different experiments that seem to me to be valuable. I‚Äôm happy that they‚Äôre both continuing to exist.‚Äù\n\nButerin added that both protocols can also be considered ‚Äúmore honorable‚Äù than ‚Äúoverinflated‚Äù scams that the cryptocurrency space has been littered with over the years.\n\n‚ÄúI do think that there is a kind of core commitment to values in there that I think is valuable for the space to actually provide something that matters to people.‚Äù\n\nAnother central theme emphasized by Buterin was the need for blockchain to move beyond its current limitations by prioritizing scalability:\n\n‚ÄúWe need to find ways to scale up blockchain systems to handle a larger number of transactions without sacrificing security or decentralization.‚Äù\n\nThis sentiment echoes the growing consensus within the industry, as developers and innovators strive to enhance the capabilities of blockchain networks.'}]

"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the market trend for ETH is currently bearish, with indicators such as the MACD signal on sell and fluctuating total transactions and gas usage pointing towards a potential further decline in the near future. On the other hand, the news analyst report presents a more positive outlook for Ethereum, highlighting factors such as potential price patterns mirroring with Solana, significant investments in options contracts, and upcoming upgrades that could lead to an upward trend.

In light of these conflicting reports, it is crucial to adopt a balanced and cautious approach to trading ETH. While short-term gains may be tempting, prioritizing long-term profitability and risk management is key in navigating the volatile market. By staying informed on market trends, positive news developments, and being prepared to adjust trading actions accordingly, traders can effectively manage risks and maximize overall profit.

Considering the current market uncertainty, a conservative trading approach is warranted to ensure sustainable profitability over time. Therefore, my trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.5, reflecting a cautious stance in light of the conflicting reports and the need to manage risks effectively in the current market environment.

*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market has been experiencing a downward trend with fluctuating indicators, suggesting volatility. The recent switch in MACD signal to a buy trend could potentially indicate a reversal towards a bullish direction, but further confirmation is needed. The news analyst report highlights mixed sentiments in the market, with positive developments like Avail's Data Attestation Bridge and potential opportunities from Bitcoin BRC-20 token migration, but also regulatory concerns impacting certain projects like BarnBridge.

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a cautious and balanced approach is crucial in navigating the current market conditions. Monitoring key on-chain indicators and staying informed about news developments are essential for making informed trading decisions. Given the uncertainty and conflicting reports, prioritizing long-term profitability over short-term gains is recommended to effectively manage risks.

Considering the synthesized reports, the market trend for ETH may see short-term volatility due to regulatory concerns but could experience growth in the long term with new developments and partnerships. Therefore, a conservative trading approach that focuses on long-term strategies is advised to navigate potential challenges and maximize profitability.

Based on the analysis and the recommended approach, I would take a trading action with a confidence level of 0.5, indicating a neutral stance in the market to manage risks effectively.

She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nIn a recent video, Guy Turner, the host of Coin Bureau, has captivated the attention of Coin Bureau‚Äôs 2.28 million subscribers by unveiling two key catalysts that could potentially ignite a powerful bullish run for Ethereum (ETH). These upcoming milestones hold the promise of driving ETH‚Äôs price to new heights.\n\nProto-dank sharding upgrade\n\nThe first milestone highlighted by Turner is the eagerly anticipated proto-dank sharding upgrade, officially known as EIP-4844. This groundbreaking upgrade seeks to address Ethereum‚Äôs long-standing scalability challenge, allowing the network to achieve a level of scalability comparable to centralized computer systems.\n\nBy tackling Ethereum‚Äôs primary bottleneck‚Äîdata availability‚Äîproto-dank sharding introduces special blobs of data that enhance transaction data accessibility. This boost in scalability is expected to result in lower fees, faster transaction speeds on layer-2 solutions, and an overall improvement in Ethereum‚Äôs performance.\n\n‚ÄúThe biggest upcoming milestone for Ethereum is the EIP-4844 upgrade‚Äù\n\nEnhancing Privacy, Post ETH Staking?\n\nTurner then turns the spotlight to Ethereum‚Äôs renewed focus on privacy, marking it as the second significant milestone. Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin has openly acknowledged privacy as one of the Ethereum ecosystem‚Äôs major challenges. To tackle this issue, Ethereum developers have been diligently exploring solutions, such as the implementation of stealth addresses.\n\nThe recent attention to privacy has been further intensified by the Shappella upgrade, which has sparked increased interest from institutional investors. Recognizing the growing demand for privacy from these investors, Ethereum aims to deliver enhanced privacy features that align with their requirements.\n\nWith these two powerful catalysts on the horizon, Ethereum‚Äôs potential for a remarkable price surge is gaining momentum. As Ethereum continues to address critical challenges and push the boundaries of innovation, investors and enthusiasts eagerly anticipate the impact these developments will have on the cryptocurrency‚Äôs value.'}, {'id': 11, 'time': 'Sat, 08 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Tron Founder Justin Sun Moves Massive Ethereum On-Chain, Sell-Off Incoming? - U.Today', 'content': "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTron Founder Justin Sun is in the headlines today after his latest on-chain transaction was brought to life. According to insights shared by crypto sleuth Lookonchain, Justin Sun transferred a total of 23,000 ETH worth approximately $43 million to Poloniex. While the purpose of the transfer remains unknown, there has been growing speculation from crypto Twitter.\n\nPotential reasons for funds movement\n\nJustin Sun owns the Poloniex exchange and, as a crypto founder with many top Web3.0 companies in his portfolio, the recent funds movement, which is not uncommon with him, can mean a lot of things. First, Justin Sun may set his eyes on gradual liquidation to take advantage of the recent bouts of price surges that Ethereum has experienced over the past few months.\n\nAccording to an extensive review of the associated wallet address, it was discovered that Justin Sun is a functional trader in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem, partaking in a series of staking activities from which he earns regular rewards. As a platform that supports staking, part of the reason for moving the funds to Poloniex might be to also stake it there as he has a record of doing this.\n\nAnother plausible reason is to cushion liquidity on the Poloniex exchange. With Justin Sun's direct oversight on the trading platform, ensuring there is enough liquidity to fulfill all customers' orders is essential, and this funds movement can be directed to this purpose.\n\nJustifiable fears?\n\nJustin Sun is undeniably a market whale with large holdings of different digital currencies beyond Ethereum. While the recent moves with respect to the Ethereum transfer have sparked fear of a possible sell-off, the fear of a sell-off might be unjustified.\n\nThis is because the total sum of the funds might not make a dent in the Ethereum market, which boasts a market capitalization of over $224 billion. Should Justin Sun choose to sell off the quoted ETH tokens, the impact on the market may not be as grievous as is being projected."}, {'id': 5, 'time': 'Sat, 08 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'These Two Catalysts Could Send Ethereum‚Äôs Price Exploding Higher, According to Coin Bureau‚Äôs Guy Turner - The Daily Hodl', 'content': "Coin Bureau host Guy Turner is listing two catalysts that could potentially trigger a bullish run for Ethereum (ETH).\n\nIn a new video, Turner tells Coin Bureau‚Äôs 2.28 million subscribers that two upcoming milestones could send ‚Äúcould send ETH‚Äôs price higher.‚Äù\n\nAccording to Turner, one of the milestones is the proto-danksharding upgrade.\n\n‚ÄúThe biggest upcoming milestone for Ethereum is the EIP-4844 upgrade which is colloquially referred to as proto-danksharding. The reason why proto-dank sharding is a big deal is because it will basically allow Ethereum to reach a level of scalability that‚Äôs comparable with centralized computer systems. This will be achieved by addressing Ethereum‚Äôs main bottleneck to scalability which is data availability‚Ä¶\n\nProto-danksharding solves this by making it possible for special blobs of data to exist on the Ethereum blockchain. These blobs make transaction data more readily available which should increase Ethereum scalability, lower its fees and increase transaction speeds on its layer-2s.‚Äù\n\nThe Coin Bureau host further says that the second upcoming milestone for Ethereum is an effort to enhance privacy.\n\n‚ÄúBesides proto-danksharding, Ethereum developers have apparently been hyper-focused on privacy.\n\nBack in January, [Ethereum creator] Vitalik [Buterin] penned a blog post where he referred to privacy as ‚Äòone of the largest remaining challenges‚Äô in the Ethereum ecosystem and proposed stealth addresses as one solution.\n\nIn April, privacy on Ethereum came into the spotlight again because of supposed privacy concerns related to ETH staking.\n\nJust last month, Vitalik penned another blog post where he noted privacy as being one of the ‚Äòthree transitions that Ethereum must implement or else it will fail.‚Äô\n\nThe sudden focus on privacy is not all that surprising when you realize that institutional investors want privacy more than anyone else.

While this groundbreaking event garnered much attention, there‚Äôs another metric steadily ascending in the background, silently shaping the future trajectory of ETH with great potential impact.\n\nRead Ethereum‚Äôs [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nEthereum new addresses surge\n\nAmidst the focus on Ethereum‚Äôs staking and price trends, it‚Äôs easy to overlook other crucial metrics. However, recent Santiment data sheds light on a quietly surging aspect: the network‚Äôs remarkable growth.\n\nThe data indicated a consistent influx of new users joining the network, signaling potential market cap expansion.\n\nA closer examination of the chart revealed that over 580,000 new addresses were created between 1 July and 7 July alone. This remarkable surge further highlighted the underlying strength and promising trajectory of ETH.\n\nETH on exchanges decline\n\nAccording to the latest data from Coin Market Cap, Ethereum held an impressive 19% of the total cryptocurrency market cap. With this, it secured its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency, surpassed only by Bitcoin [BTC], which claimed over 49%. Despite ETH‚Äôs market dominance, ETH holders actively withdrew their holdings from exchanges.\n\nSantiment‚Äôs chart revealed that the supply of Ethereum on exchanges, relative to the total supply, stood at a mere 9.1%. This suggested that less than 10% of all ETH remained on exchanges, while the majority had been moved to other storage methods.\n\nFurther analysis of the chart revealed that approximately 11.3 million ETH was being held on exchanges at press time, indicating a visible decline. This withdrawal trend underscored the growing preference among Ethereum holders for alternative storage solutions.\n\nAlso, it reflected their confidence in the long-term value of their holdings.\n\nEthereum price declines as TVL dominates\n\nAccording to data from DefiLlama, Ethereum maintained its position as the leading blockchain in terms of Total Value Locked (TVL), compared to other chains. As of this writing, the total TVL across all chains was $44 billion, with Ethereum commanding over $26 billion.\n\nRealistic or not, here‚Äôs ETH‚Äôs market cap in BTC‚Äôs terms\n\nThis meant that Ethereum held more than half of the entire TVL in the market, showcasing its dominant presence in decentralized finance.\n\nHowever, ETH has experienced a recent decline.

Discover SCENE\n\nProto-danksharding is going to completely change Ethereum‚Äîand for the better, says core developer Mario Havel.\n\nAt ETH Barcelona over the weekend, Havel told Decrypt that the next big Ethereum upgrade, dubbed "Dencun," is nearing the "final stages of planning." The upgrade will do many things, but one of the major changes is the introduction of the proto-danksharding feature, which will allow the network to scale and handle up to 100,000 transaction per second, devs say.\n\n‚ÄúThe majority of the focus right now is on the implementation of EIP-4844, also known as proto-danksharding,‚Äù Havel explained. According to the core developer, EIP-4844 sets the foundation for data sharding through the introduction of a new transaction type‚Äîthe oddly named ‚Äúdata blob.‚Äù\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBlob blocks also introduce what‚Äôs called a KZG commitment. The name stands for Kate-Zaverucha-Goldberg, the names of the original authors who came up with it.\n\nAccording to Havel, the KZG commitment will point to certain ‚Äúblobs‚Äù of information. That\'s helpful for layer-2 scaling solutions, like Optimism and Arbitrum, because they batch transactions together in what are known as "rollups" and currently have issues accessing data needed to verify those transactions.\n\nThe easier it is for a rollup to access the data it needs, the faster and cheaper the transactions can be verified and reported back to the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nAccording to Carl Beekhuizen and Trent van Epps, two members of the Ethereum Foundation who are working on proto-danksharding, the blobs set the foundation for data sharding.\n\nOn the Epicenter Podcast earlier this year, they clarified the idea, saying that instead of having multiple simultaneous sidechains, there is only one chain but with ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù amounts of information.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe data can then get split up on the one chain, allowing for individual stakers or smaller sized machines to be responsible only for a sliver of that large amount of information. And, says Havel, that data will only be stored for a few weeks at a time.\n\nKZG commitments are at the end of their ‚ÄúKZG summoning ceremony,‚Äù or a ‚Äúmulti party computation ceremony,‚Äù said Havel, which calls upon the community to help with the scaling effort.\n\nHavel also explained that blobs will only store data for a limited amount of time, and will never touch the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), the environment where all smart contracts live and interact with one another, nor the Ethereum state directly.\n\n‚ÄúInstead, they will create a KZG commitment, which will allow us to handle data much more efficiently and in a much cheaper way,‚Äù he explained, given the fact that blobs are small enough that they make disk use manageable.\n\nHavel explained that blobs will only store data for a limited amount of time, and will never touch the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). ‚ÄúWe will be able to handle data much more efficiently, and in a cheaper way as well,‚Äù he concluded.\n\nAdditional reporting by Rodrigo Martinez.'}]

Since their launch, Ordinals have been creating a stir in the Bitcoin community, setting record numbers of inscriptions on multiple occasions.\n\nApart from Bitcoin\'s Ordinals and Ethereum\'s NFTs, several other blockchains have also made significant strides in the NFT market.

Discover SCENE\n\n‚ÄúI think if we want Bitcoin to be more than payments, it needs more scaling solutions,‚Äù said Vitalik Buterin, on a Twitter Spaces this week, pointing to several experiments that Ethereum has been trying out over the past years.\n\nBut the main problem, for him, is politics.\n\n‚ÄúBitcoin has really weird politics,‚Äù he said, adding that he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt vibe with them.‚Äù\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOver 32,000 people tuned in to listen as the Ethereum inventor talked with "altcoin slayer" Eric Wall and Bitcoin developer Udi Wertheimer about what Bitcoiners can learn from Ethereum.\n\nThe trio tackled one of the main pain points of the world\'s biggest cryptocurrency by market cap: Bitcoin\'s slow transaction throughput, and thus the need for layer two scaling approaches to increase the speed at which people can send and receive the digital asset.\n\nThe majority of the discussion revolved around scaling, which is where Buterin, Wall, and Wertheimer think Bitcoiners could learn the most from the presumed rival chain.\n\n‚ÄúI think if we want Bitcoin to be more than just payments, it will need scaling options like Plasma or ZK Rollups,‚Äù said Buterin, both of which have been tried on Ethereum. Optimism and Arbitrum are two successful examples of ‚Äúrollups‚Äù that could serve as case studies for Bitcoin, he said, adding that it would ‚Äúbe good to have an open mind‚Äù with regards to ZK-snark based solutions‚Äîindicating a clear preference.\n\nEthereum has been experimenting with a wide variety of scaling solutions over the years, and is in the process of its latest update, EIP-4844, which introduces blob blocks‚Äìenabling up to 100,000 transactions per second.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWall pushed the idea that Bitcoin should be studying these trials, fearing that the ecosystem will be left with less secure rollups. Buterin responded that the proposal will likely draw ‚Äúcontroversy with security hawks.‚Äù\n\nWall, who has been taking center stage as of late with the Taproot Wizards, brought up Bitcoin‚Äôs security model, and the 21 million hard cap. It‚Äôs a question that Buterin said he has grappled with, although he pointed to Ordinals as providing a reasonable fee market to cover the reducing block subsidies as well as subsequent security concerns.\n\nButerin also thinks Ordinals have brought a ‚Äúreturn to builder culture‚Äù which in his words ‚Äúis very good.‚Äù He added that he ‚Äúdefinitely see signs of hope now that we have Ordinals,‚Äù calling them a ‚Äúreal pushback to laser eyed maximalism.‚Äù\n\nButerin also tried to find ten things that both ecosystems shared. He pointed to claims of immutability by both chains, along with the fact they both have issues with layer-1 privacy. Buterin also mentioned that both Ethereum and Bitcoin have showcased how difficult it is to do things in decentralized consensus models.\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder ended on a rather optimistic note, trying possibly to bring together both communities.\n\n‚ÄúI think a world where there is at least one of these chains is better than one with none,‚Äù he concluded.'}, {'id': 20, 'time': 'Sun, 09 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum Node Locations Raise Concerns About US Government Involvement | Bitcoinist.com - Bitcoinist', 'content': 'Ethereum is currently the largest proof of stake (P0S) network after transitioning from a proof of work (PoW) mechanism late last year. This means that the network now uses validators to carry out transactions as opposed to miners using energy-intensive computers to solve complex mathematical problems to do the same thing ‚Äì something that has been applauded as a step in the right direction by many in the space.\n\nHowever, the location of Ethereum nodes worldwide, particularly their concentration in a particular location, has raised concerns among participants after a Twitter user pointed out a disturbing fact.\n\nMore Than 50% Of Ethereum Nodes Are In The United States\n\nOn Sunday, a Twitter user that goes by Hamzah Khan made a post revealing that over 50% of Ethereum‚Äôs nodes are being hosted in datacenters in the United States.\n\nThere are currently about 5,500 nodes running Ethereum, and about half are based in the US. Of these, over half are in a single data center in Virginia, 20 minutes away from the white house and the CIA headquarters. FUD Morning üôè ‚Äî Hamzah Khan (@_khanhamzah) July 9, 2023\n\nMore interestingly though was that of this massive share of the node distribution being hosted in the country, more than 50% were being hosted in a single datacenter.\n\nThe location of this particular datacenter was of the most interest. The datacenter which is located in the state of Virginia is reportedly only 20 minutes away from the headquarters of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), as well as the White House.\n\nNow, while the location has been pointed out, it shows no participation of the US government in the running of Ethereum. Rather, as the Ether.fi website points out, it shows that Ethereum is not as decentralized as participants would like.\n\nETH price falls below $1,900 support | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nAdditionally, Mike Silagadze, CEO of Ether.fi, also responded to the tweet to clarify that the number of nodes on its website needed to be updated. Compared to the 5,500 on the website, Silagadze said there were now around 6,800 Ethereum nodes running. But as another Twitter user pointed out, it doesn‚Äôt change the ‚Äòdistribution‚Äô of the nodes already pointed out above.\n\nThe Rise Of Liquid Staking\n\nBecoming a validator on Ethereum carries a high barrier to entry because valuators are required to have a total of 32 ETH. At current prices, this translates to around $60,000 to run a single validator node. And since a large percentage of users cannot afford this, liquid staking protocols have seen a lot of success for the services they offer.\n\nLiquid staking protocols such as Lido Finance and Rocket Pool allow investors to still become validators even if they don‚Äôt have up to 32 ETH. Users are able to pool their ETH together to make a validator. This way, they are able to earn rewards without operating a full node themselves.\n\nLido leads ETH liquid staking | Source: DeFiLlama\n\nOver the last year, protocols such as Lido Finance have seen sharp growth, propelling them to the forefront of ETH staking. Currently, there is over $14 billion staked on the Lido liquid staking protocol, accounting for around 30% of the total staked ETH. In total, liquid staking now accounts for more than 37% of the total staked ETH, and rising.\n\nThis growth was born out of the need for more decentralization in the Ethereum network as nodes become more spread out. However, despite the rise in liquid staking, Ethereum nodes are still highly concentrated, mainly in the United States.'}]

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nCryptocurrency markets often undergo significant price fluctuations, leading to unique buying opportunities known as "fire sales." The term refers to situations when an asset is perceived to be oversold, prompting interested investors to buy in at relatively low prices. For Ethereum (ETH), one of the leading indicators that tracks these opportunities is the rainbow chart, and it is currently signaling a "fire sale."\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo understand what this means, let\'s first examine the rainbow chart concept, typically used in Bitcoin (BTC) analysis. The Bitcoin rainbow chart is a logarithmic price chart that applies color-coded bands to represent the predicted price growth of BTC over time. Each color corresponds to different levels of price action, from the red "maximum bubble territory" to the dark blue "basically a fire sale."\n\nThese charts are based on the assumption that Bitcoin\'s price will follow a predictable exponential growth pattern over the long term, with periodic boom-and-bust cycles.\n\nTranslating this to Ethereum, the rainbow chart concept suggests that Ethereum is currently in "fire sale" territory, indicating that ETH could be significantly undervalued at its current price levels.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to remember that these charts require different calculations when applied to Ethereum. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a capped supply and predictable inflation, Ethereum\'s monetary policy is more complex, particularly with its transition from proof of work (PoW) to proof of stake (PoS).\n\nThis shift alters Ethereum\'s inflation rate and introduces a new deflationary mechanism through the burning of transaction fees, fundamentally changing the dynamics that the rainbow chart seeks to model.\n\nWhile Ethereum\'s rainbow chart may currently indicate a "fire sale," these metrics should not be used in isolation. Investors should account for Ethereum\'s unique monetary policy changes, market conditions and other technical indicators when making investment decisions.'}, {'id': 31, 'time': 'Mon, 10 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Rise Amid Uptick In BTC Wallets To All-Time High: Analyst Says This Is How Lo - Benzinga', 'content': 'Major cryptocurrencies traded in positive territory on Monday evening as the number of wallets holding at least one Bitcoin reached a record-breaking 1,008,737 million, according to Glassnode data.\n\nCryptocurrency Gains +/- Price (Recorded 9:30 p.m. EDT) Bitcoin BTC/USD +1.69% $30,578 Ethereum ETH/USD +1.56% $1883 Dogecoin DOGE/USD +0.92% $0.065\n\nWhat Happened: The growing distribution of wallets with a minimum of one Bitcoin indicates a surge in decentralization within the network.\n\nIn May, the number of wallets holding at least one bitcoin surpassed one million and has been steadily increasing ever since.\n\nTop Gainer (24 Hour)\n\nCryptocurrency Gains +/- Price (Recorded 9:30 p.m. EDT) Mina +17.04% $0.50 Polygon +9.42% $0.7413 Wrapped BTC +9.09% $30,497.39\n\nAt the time of writing, the global crypto market capitalization stood at $1.19 trillion, an increase of 1.67% over the last day.\n\nUS stocks rebounded on Monday, signaling a positive turn for Wall Street after a challenging week.

Miner profitability was one of the key reasons for the elevated price targets, but that might not be as easy as electricity costs grow and over-surging debt payments," wrote Edward Moya, Senior Analyst at OANDA.\n\nHe added, "Bitcoin appears locked in a range, but that might continue as we may have to wait months before getting any concrete ETF updates."\n\nPseudonymous trader Altcoin Sherpa said that we may have to wait about eight months for the next Bitcoin bull run. According to the trader, Bitcoin‚Äôs price action on the weekly time-frame chart appears bullish, as it currently sits above its major exponential moving averages (EMAs), resembling a similar pattern seen in 2019.\n\n"We can see on the one-week, all of the EMAs are clumping together and tightening up.

And close to 24 million Ethereum is currently locked up across 744,000 validators that process transactions, according to a dashboard on Dune Analytics created by a user named hildobby.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEthereum is one of many blockchains that utilizes a proof-of-stake consensus model, which, in the case of Ethereum, involves validators pledging at least 32 Ethereum for the chance to validate transactions and receive associated fees.\n\nBut that hasn‚Äôt always been the case. In September of last year, after much anticipation, Ethereum transitioned from proof-of-work‚Äîan energy-intensive process used by networks like Bitcoin‚Äîto proof-of-stake. And for months, staked Ethereum couldn‚Äôt be withdrawn until an upgrade this past April enabled it.\n\nFor reference, around $29 billion worth of Ethereum, or 14.5% of ETH in circulation, was pledged leading up to the pivotal Shanghai upgrade that enabled staking withdrawals.\n\nMonday‚Äôs milestone represents a noteworthy achievement and captures the success of Ethereum‚Äôs journey toward a consensus model that‚Äôs ultimately friendlier on the environment, prominent venture capitalist and crypto analyst Adam Cochran told Decrypt.\n\n‚ÄúThis is a huge point of progress for the network, aligning economic incentives with security goals works and is critical for a decentralized network,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe should all be proud of this milestone.‚Äù\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen it comes to how people stake their Ethereum, Lido Finance, the crypto market‚Äôs largest liquid staking protocol, is by far the most popular choice. Allowing users to stake ETH in any amount and receive a staked Ethereum token called ‚ÄústETH‚Äù in exchange, it accounts for nearly 32% of all staked Ethereum, according to Dune.\n\nCryptocurrency exchanges are also big players. Coinbase, Kraken, Binance, and OKX account for around 19% of all staked Ethereum, according to Dune. In a bear market, where trading volumes are depressed, staking has helped exchanges find an alternative source of revenue.\n\nYet regulators in the U.S. have their qualms with how staking services are offered to customers, alleging they run afoul of securities laws. Both Kraken and Coinbase have faced regulatory heat for staking products this year‚ÄîKraken settled a lawsuit in February and Coinbase‚Äôs is ongoing.\n\nFinancial institutions are paying attention to staking and exploring how it can bolster the products they offer, in Canada, at least.

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
The news articles provide a mixed outlook for the ETH cryptocurrency market. The first article suggests that Ethereum may be undervalued and in a "fire sale" territory based on the rainbow chart concept, indicating a potential buying opportunity. However, the second article highlights a hack on the DeFi protocol Arcadia Finance, resulting in a significant loss of funds, which could lead to negative sentiment and impact market confidence. On the other hand, the third article mentions that staked Ethereum now accounts for 20% of the total supply, showcasing increased participation in the network and potential long-term stability. Overall, while the market may experience short-term volatility due to the hack incident, the long-term trend could be positive with growing staking activity supporting Ethereum's network security and sustainability.

However, the bears were seen active near the $1,900 resistance zone.\n\nThere is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,900 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ether is now trading above $1,865 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nImmediate resistance is near the $1,890 level. The first major resistance is near the $1,900 zone and the trend line. The trend line is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the key decline from the $1,955 swing high to the $1,825 low.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nA close above the $1,900 resistance could start a decent increase toward $1,975. The next major resistance is near the $2,000 level. Any more gains could send Ether toward the $2,050 resistance or even $2,120.\n\nAnother Rejection in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,900 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,865 level or the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThe first major support is near the $1,825 level, below which there is a risk of a larger decline. The next major support is near the $1,740 level. Any more losses could send Ether toward the $1,720 support level in the near term.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD ‚Äì The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI ‚Äì The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level ‚Äì $1,825\n\nMajor Resistance Level ‚Äì $1,900\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market has been experiencing volatility, with fluctuations in key indicators such as total transactions, gas usage, and total value transferred. The switch in MACD signal from sell to buy suggests a potential reversal in the market trend, but the stability of unique addresses raises uncertainty about the sustainability of this buy signal.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights positive catalysts for Ethereum, including upgrades addressing scalability and privacy concerns, as well as growing interest and confidence in the cryptocurrency based on new addresses, declining ETH on exchanges, and dominance in decentralized finance.

Considering the reflection analyst report, a balanced and cautious approach to trading in the volatile ETH market has been effective in managing risks and maximizing profitability. Long-term profitability should be prioritized over short-term gains, with a focus on monitoring key trends and making strategic decisions based on both on-chain and news developments.

In conclusion, the market trend for Ethereum appears to be positive in the long term, with potential for a significant rally based on positive catalysts and indicators. Therefore, a conservative trading approach is recommended to navigate potential challenges and uncertainties, while capitalizing on long-term growth opportunities.

Based on the synthesized reports and the emphasis on long-term strategies, I would take a trading action with a confidence level of 0.7, indicating a moderately positive outlook for the ETH market.

0.7
DAILY RETURN:
-2.3386673379199863e-05
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, we see a mixed picture for ETH with a potential bullish reversal indicated by the MACD signal shifting from sell to buy. The total transactions are decreasing, but the total value transferred is fluctuating, suggesting some market volatility.

The news analyst report adds to this mixed outlook by highlighting potential bullish momentum for ETH to surpass $2000, but also raises concerns about decentralization and increasing competition in the NFT market.

Reflecting on the reports, it is clear that a balanced and cautious approach is necessary in the current volatile market. While there are positive indicators for ETH's price, there are also challenges that need to be considered. Therefore, a long-term strategy focused on managing risks and maximizing profitability is recommended.

Considering the uncertainty in the market and the need for a conservative approach, I would take a slightly cautious stance with a trading action of 0.3, indicating moderate confidence in the potential bullish reversal but also acknowledging the challenges and volatility in the market. This approach allows for strategic decision-making to navigate the current market conditions effectively.
ACTION:
0.3
DAILY RETURN:

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the ETH market is currently experiencing volatility with mixed bullish and bearish signals. The fluctuating trends in open price, total transactions, gas used, and average gas price indicate uncertainty in market direction. The switching MACD signal further adds to the unpredictability of the market.

On the other hand, the news analyst report presents a mixed outlook for ETH. While there are concerns about a recent hack on the DeFi protocol, there are also positive indicators such as Ethereum potentially being undervalued and the increasing staking activity contributing to long-term stability.

In reflection, a balanced and cautious approach has been effective in managing risks and maximizing profitability in the volatile ETH market. Monitoring key on-chain indicators and staying informed about news developments have been crucial in making informed trading decisions.

Considering the mixed signals and uncertainties in the market, it is recommended to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains. A moderately conservative stance with a focus on strategic decision-making is advised to navigate potential challenges and capitalize on growth opportunities.

Therefore, my trading action would be 0.3, reflecting a moderate level of confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.

Therefore, a long-term strategy focused on managing risks and maximizing profitability is recommended.

Considering the uncertainty in the market and the need for a conservative approach, I would take a slightly cautious stance with a trading action of 0.3, indicating moderate confidence in the potential bullish reversal but also acknowledging the challenges and volatility in the market. This approach allows for strategic decision-making to navigate the current market conditions effectively.

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the ETH market is currently experiencing volatility with mixed bullish and bearish signals. The fluctuating trends in open price, total transactions, gas used, and average gas price indicate uncertainty in market direction. The switching MACD signal further adds to the unpredictability of the market.

On the other hand, the news analyst report presents a mixed outlook for ETH. While there are concerns about a recent hack on the DeFi protocol, there are also positive indicators such as Ethereum potentially being undervalued and the increasing staking activity contributing to long-term stability.

In reflection, a balanced and cautious approach has been effective in managing risks and maximizing profitability in the volatile ETH market. Monitoring key on-chain indicators and staying informed about news developments have been crucial in making informed trading decisions.

Considering the mixed signals and uncertainties in the market, it is recommended to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains. A moderately conservative stance with a focus on strategic decision-making is advised to navigate potential challenges and capitalize on growth opportunities.

Therefore, my trading action would be 0.3, reflecting a moderate level of confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately. This approach aligns with the recommendation to prioritize long-term profitability and navigate the current market uncertainties effectively.

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the ETH market is currently experiencing volatility with mixed bullish and bearish signals. The fluctuating trends in open price, total transactions, gas used, and average gas price indicate uncertainty in market direction. The switching MACD signal further adds to the unpredictability of the market.

On the other hand, the news analyst report presents a mixed outlook for ETH. While there are concerns about a recent hack on the DeFi protocol, there are also positive indicators such as Ethereum potentially being undervalued and the increasing staking activity contributing to long-term stability.

In reflection, a balanced and cautious approach has been effective in managing risks and maximizing profitability in the volatile ETH market. Monitoring key on-chain indicators and staying informed about news developments have been crucial in making informed trading decisions.

Considering the mixed signals and uncertainties in the market, it is recommended to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains. A moderately conservative stance with a focus on strategic decision-making is advised to navigate potential challenges and capitalize on growth opportunities.

Therefore, my trading action would be to buy ETH with a confidence level of 0.7, indicating a moderately positive outlook on the market trend and a strategic decision to focus on long-term profitability.

The ETH cryptocurrency has been experiencing a consistent uptrend with increasing open prices and total transactions, gas used, average gas prices, total value transferred, successful transactions, and unique addresses. The MACD signal has been consistently indicating a buy sentiment. However, the recent open price of 2003.25 saw a decrease in total transactions and successful transactions, along with a higher average gas price, leading to a sell signal. This could potentially indicate a short-term correction in the market trend. It is advisable to closely monitor the market for further developments to determine the future direction of the ETH price.

NEWS ANALYST REPORT:
"""
The recent news articles indicate a positive sentiment towards Ethereum (ETH) as it hits $2,000 for the first time since May following a favorable XRP ruling, showing a 5% rise over the past 24 hours and a 14% gain over the last month. Additionally, on-chain metrics show growth and stability for ETH, with the total value of staked ether increasing by 70% since the beginning of the year. The rise in staking, coupled with decreasing ETH balances on exchanges, suggests a decrease in sell-side pressure and a growing demand for ETH. Furthermore, Ethereum scaling protocols utilizing zero-knowledge rollups are driving innovation and adoption, with major launches and investments in the sector. Overall, these factors indicate a bullish trend for Ethereum in the cryptocurrency market.

*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that there are mixed signals in the market, with a buy sentiment indicated by the MACD signal but a sell signal triggered by the recent decrease in total transactions and successful transactions. The news analyst report, on the other hand, paints a bullish picture for Ethereum, highlighting positive sentiment, growth in staking, decreasing sell-side pressure, and innovation in scaling protocols. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a balanced and cautious approach, prioritizing long-term profitability and staying informed about key indicators and news developments.

Taking into account the mixed signals and uncertainties in the market, it is prudent to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains. While short-term fluctuations may present opportunities for quick profits, a focus on long-term profitability and risk management is crucial in navigating the volatile ETH market effectively.

Considering the overall bullish sentiment in the news analyst report and the importance of long-term strategies highlighted in the reflection analyst report, I would recommend a moderately conservative trading approach. Therefore, I would take a trading action with a confidence level of 0.5, indicating a neutral stance in the market and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.

The Ethereum NFT Sensation's Wild Ride - Yahoo Finance", 'content': "CryptoPunks have been back in the news of late. Seedphrase, a DJ who owns the rarest CryptoPunks NFT out there (CryptoPunk #8348), announced this month that he had signed to talent agency WME for a new record release. And in June, Yuga Labs‚Äîwhich acquired CryptoPunks in May 2022‚Äîannounced that it intended to release a book on the popular NFTs. So what, exactly, is this oddly-named commodity with its pixellated avatars?\n\nYuga Labs Is Writing the Book on CryptoPunks‚ÄîLiterally\n\nThe market for crypto collectibles released as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) exploded in 2021, with $2.5 billion in transaction volume in the first six months as NFTs entered the mainstream.\n\nCryptoPunk DJ Seedphrase Signs to WME, Plans to Release Music\n\nThe boom also saw NFT enthusiasts rediscovering some of the earliest non-fungible tokens, propelling the value of these crypto collectibles to hitherto-unknown highs.\n\nOne of these early NFT projects was CryptoPunks: a set of randomly generated pixel-based avatars. Some of the rarest, most desirable CryptoPunks have sold for millions of dollars. Seriously! By mid-2022, the tokens had seen over $2 billion total sales volume.\n\nHere‚Äôs what you need to know about one of the most popular NFT collections around.\n\nWhat are CryptoPunks?\n\nCreated by development studio Larva Labs, CryptoPunks are a series of 10,000 images tokenized as NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain. An NFT is effectively a deed of ownership to a digital item, and in this case, holding a CryptoPunks NFT means that you are the sole owner of a one-of-a-kind pixel avatar. As mentioned above, ownership of CryptoPunks changed hands from Larva to Yuga Labs in May 2022. Yuga is the creator of the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT.\n\nBeginner's Guide to NFTs: What Are Non-Fungible Tokens?\n\nEach CryptoPunk is randomly generated from a list of dozens of attributes, which means there‚Äôs an array of designs: people, zombies, apes, and even aliens. The aliens and zombies are among the most popular avatars that have commanded some of the highest sale prices to date.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhere did CryptoPunks come from?\n\nBelieve it or not, CryptoPunks were released for free back in 2017. Ethereum‚Äôs ERC-721 non-fungible token standard wasn‚Äôt even a thing at that point, and the two-person team at Larva Labs released them as an experiment. Ethereum wallet owners snatched up the 9,000 CryptoPunks that were released to the public, while Larva Labs held onto the rest.\n\nEthereum NFT CryptoPunks Hit $1 Billion in Total Sales\n\nNFT volume gradually rose over the next three years, but it wasn‚Äôt until late 2020 and especially early 2021 that demand skyrocketed for these provably scarce digital collectibles. The secondary market value for CryptoPunks shot through the roof, leading to multi-million-dollar NFT sales, auctions at Christie‚Äôs and Sotheby‚Äôs, and a wealth of CryptoPunks used as Twitter profile pictures.\n\nWhat‚Äôs so special about them?\n\nCryptoPunks have some high-profile owners, too, such as rapper Jay-Z, YouTube personality Logan Paul and tennis champion Serena Williams.\n\nOn top of that, there are clear differentiators that make certain CryptoPunks more desirable and valuable to collectors. Alien avatars are the rarest of the randomized images, and as such, alien CryptoPunks are among the most expensive NFTs sold to date. Ape and zombie designs are also in demand.\n\nMost of the CryptoPunks just look like humans with varying features and accessories, however, and the plainer-looking ones are close to the market floor in terms of asking price on NFT marketplaces.\n\nThe future\n\nWhat‚Äôs next for CryptoPunks? Well, they will likely continue to change hands on secondary markets, potentially generating huge returns for investors who bought in before the surge.\n\nThere‚Äôs no way to tell whether the current level of demand will continue, but the entry-level price for Punks continues to rise. As of July 14, 2023, the average CryptoPunk NFT goes for about 53 ETH (about $2000)\n\nThis story was originally published on January 10, 2022 and was updated on July 14, 2023."}, {'id': 1, 'time': 'Fri, 14 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum scaling protocols drive zero-knowledge proof use: Finance Redefined - Cointelegraph', 'content': 'Welcome to Finance Redefined, your weekly dose of essential decentralized finance (DeFi) insights ‚Äî a newsletter crafted to bring you the most significant developments from the past week.\n\nThis week, Finance Redefined looks at the growing popularity of zero-knowledge proof-based scalable solutions.

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain, news, and reflection analyst reports, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing volatility and uncertainty. The on-chain data indicates fluctuating trends with high activity levels, while the news suggests a potential bullish trend with the introduction of Linea and positive analyst sentiments. The reflection report emphasizes the importance of a balanced and cautious approach, prioritizing long-term profitability over short-term gains.

Considering the mixed signals and uncertainties in the market, it is prudent to adopt a moderately conservative trading approach. Monitoring key indicators such as total transactions, gas usage, and total value transferred will be crucial in making informed decisions. Long-term strategies should be prioritized to navigate potential challenges and capitalize on growth opportunities effectively.

Given the overall market outlook, I would take a slightly cautious approach and assign a trading action of 0.3.

By maintaining a strategic and balanced approach, I aim to manage risks effectively and maximize profitability in the long run.

But with Ethereum Improvement Proposal 4844 or EIP-4844, things might get interesting for a certain set of altcoins.\n\nRead more: Ethereum Improvement Proposal EIP -4844 turns experts bullish, will ETH price rally?\n\nEthereum gas fees to improve vastly in EIP-4844\n\nEthereum (ETH) has already undergone major hard forks in the last few years, ranging from London Hardfork to the recent Merge upgrade. All of these code changes are aimed at making the Ethereum blockchain more secure and scalable while keeping it decentralized.\n\nThe latest in the line of upgrades is the EIP-4844, aka Shard Blob Transactions update, which is aimed at reducing gas fees by introducing a special transaction type. The official EIP website for Ethereum summarizes the goal of this upgrade as follows.\n\nIntroduce a new transaction format for ‚Äòblob-carrying transactions‚Äô which contain a large amount of data that cannot be accessed by EVM execution, but whose commitment can be accessed. The format is intended to be fully compatible with the format that will be used in full sharding."\n\nThis new transaction formation will be forward-compatible and will be used in future upgrades of sharding.\n\nWhy Layer 2 solutions are in the spotlight?\n\nIn addition to preparing the Ethereum blockchain for full dank sharding, the EIP-4844 will have a huge impact on gas fees. Despite the Merge or London hard fork, the gas fees for Layer 1 (L1) solutions are still high for many users. While Layer 2 (L2) solutions have reduced gas fees by three to eight times than L1 chains, it is still high for many retail investors.\n\nAlthough EIP-4844 is aimed at reducing gas fees for Ethereum‚Äôs beacon chain, the benefits of it will inevitably be compounded for Layer 2 scaling solutions. Hence, this update will attract many investors to interact with L2 chains like Optimism (OP), Arbitrum (ARB), Polygon (MATIC/POL) and so on.\n\nWhile this speculative move will improve the fundamentals of L2 chains, it will also attract traders and prospective buyers looking to capitalize, which could trigger a massive rally for these altcoins.'}, {'id': 11, 'time': 'Sat, 15 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Polkadot second to Ethereum: What it means in the bull market - AMBCrypto News', 'content': 'Polkadot‚Äôs revenue and fees remained stable last month, and TVL rose .\n\nMetrics and market indicators were bullish on the token.\n\nPolkadot [DOT] outperformed the rest of the crypto market as it was only behind Ethereum [ETH] at press time, reflecting higher adoption.

As per CoinMarketCap, DOT was up by more than 6% and 9% in the last 24 hours and week, respectively.\n\nAt the time of writing, it was trading at $5.63 with a market capitalization of over $6 billion, making it the 13th largest crypto. A look at DOT‚Äôs metrics gave an understanding of what caused this surge.\n\nWhile DOT‚Äôs price declined, its Open Interest also went down.

GHO‚Äôs code was audited four times before its mainnet launch. The price of AAVE is up nearly 60% in the past month.\n\nAave Launches GHO Stablecoin On Ethereum Mainnet\n\nAave is seeking to capitalize on the demand for a good decentralized option in the stablecoin sector with GHO.\n\nConfidence in incumbent stablecoins was recently rattled, with each of the top four centralized stablecoins briefly depegging this year.

These anime-style Avatars are some of the most recognizable PFPs in the NFT market, second only to Yuga Labs‚Äô Bored Ape Yacht Club.\n\nThe Azuki story is as polarizing as it is compelling. While Azuki NFT collections have boasted astronomic price appreciation and explosive trading volume, the ecosystem has been tarnished by a dark history of failed projects and disappointing new collections.\n\nDespite its flawed reputation, the Azuki NFT ecosystem has been a trendsetter within the cryptocurrency space. The Azuki community has been through multiple baptisms of fire and come out the other side uncharred and unfazed.\n\nIn this article, we‚Äôll take the Red Bean and go down the Rabbit Hole to explore all the non-fungible tokens and FUD that shape this mysterious and iconic Web3 startup.\n\nWhat Are Azuki NFTs?\n\nInitially, Azuki NFTs were a collection of 10,000 unique digital avatars, each boasting a distinctive Japanese anime-themed design. Launched in January 2022 by a group of artists based in Los Angeles, Azuki‚Äôs skyrocketed in popularity, becoming a sensation in the Ethereum (ETH) NFT community.\n\nSince then, the Azuki Ecosystem has expanded, with multiple NFT collections and a tight-knit Web3 community. Ownership of an Azuki avatar grants access to a range of exclusive benefits, including Whitelist opportunities for new NFT drops, collaborations with streetwear brands, and invitations to live events.\n\nThis is all part of the Azuki vision to create a vibrant and interactive community known as The Garden, where artists, builders, and Web3 enthusiasts put their creative heads together to shape the future of the decentralized internet.\n\nThe Azuki Metaverse\n\nIf The Garden represents the beating heart of the Azuki community, Hilumia is the thriving on-chain Metaverse that will host Azuki‚Äôs digital experience.\n\nHilumia development is still in its early stages, so it‚Äôs still not completely clear what this blockchain-based digital universe will look like. The Azuki Metaverse is divided into ten separate areas, including a Skatepark, Dojo, and Arcade.\n\nWhat‚Äôs Growing in The Garden: Azuki Collections\n\nA range of NFT collections have taken root and sprouted with the Azuki Garden. Each collection represents a different aspect of the Azuki universe, offering a diverse range of digital assets for collectors and enthusiasts.\n\nAzuki Main Collection\n\nThe Azuki main collection is the cornerstone of the Azuki universe. Launched in January 2022 through a Dutch Auction, Azukis are 10,000 unique digital avatars, each hand-drawn and boasting an anime-inspired aesthetic. These avatars have quickly gained popularity for their distinctive style and the unique traits they possess.\n\nDuring the initial mint, the Azuki NFT collection sold out in minutes, registering about $30 million USD in sales, trending on NFT marketplaces like OpenSea, and catapulting Azuki into the spotlight of the NFT world.\n\nEach Azuki avatar is a unique piece of digital art, with individual characteristics that set it apart from the rest. From different hairstyles and clothing to unique accessories like swords, skateboards, and boomboxes, the diversity of Azuki avatars mirrors the community‚Äôs diversity.\n\nLike Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs, an Azuki pfp is one of the most popular digital flexes. Repping an Azuki NFT on social media is a sure way to get noticed within NFT circles.\n\nBeanz\n\nIn a bid to make entrance to The Garden more accessible and reward existing holders, Azuki Beanz sprouted from the dirt. Chiru Labs, the team behind the Azuki ecosystem, describes Beanz as sidekicks that help expand the wider Azuki community.\n\nDuring the Beanz airdrop, Azuki holders were gifted two new NFTs. At their all-time high, Beanz fetched 5 ETH on NFT Marketplaces. The Beanz airdrop was considered a shining success that not only rewarded loyal members of the Azuki community but also added a new layer of intrigue and anticipation around the Beanz collection.\n\nAzuki Elementals\n\nIf you can‚Äôt tell the difference between OG Azuki‚Äôs and Azuki Elementals, you‚Äôre not alone. The release of Chiru Labs new collection was met with both anticipation and controversy. Despite raking in $38 million USD within 15 minutes of its release, the Elementals collection faced overwhelming criticism from community members.\n\nCan you blame them? Azuki Elementals are so similar in appearance to the original collection that many loyal supporters abandoned The Garden, calling Chiru Labs nothing more than grifters and cash-grab artists guilty of extracting millions from the NFT space.\n\nWhile there are slight differences and the occasional Animal avatar, the similarities in design and aesthetic led to a significant backlash, with critics arguing that the Azuki Elementals felt like a cheaper and diluted version of the main collection. In the wake of the controversy, Azuki ecosystem floor prices dumped by over 40%.\n\nIn a desperate bid to stop the flow of criticism from ...'}]

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nRecent data reveals that Ethereum (ETH) whales are significantly selling off their holdings. One such instance involved a transaction where a whale sold 4,549 ETH for approximately $8.78 million, at a price of $1,930 around 14 hours ago. Notably, this particular whale initially spent $6 million to buy 4,549 ETH at a price of $1,319 on Jan. 9, which means they made a profit of approximately $2.78 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis sell-off pattern among ETH whales might have been triggered by a strategic move to reap the benefits of the cryptocurrency's recent surge in value. This market situation largely stems from the positive court decision in favor of Ripple's XRP, which had a ripple effect on several other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum.\n\nA whale sold 4,549 $ETH for 8.78M $USDT at a price of $1,930 14 hrs ago.\n\n\n\nThis whale spent $6M to buy 4,549 $ETH at a price of $1,319 on Jan 9, and has earned $2.78M so far.https://t.co/pzSfTqYuPn pic.twitter.com/PEtWS9LXmE ‚Äî Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 16, 2023\n\nThe court's decision seems to have provided a significant boost to the overall cryptocurrency market sentiment, leading to a considerable price appreciation for several tokens, Ethereum included.\n\nSubsequent to the XRP court decision, Ethereum surged to around $2,000. This impressive rally undoubtedly offered an attractive profit-taking opportunity for ETH whales who had acquired their holdings at lower price levels. As such, the current ETH sell-off by whales could be a reflection of these large investors cashing in on their profits, an understandable move considering the crypto market's notorious volatility.\n\nHowever, as whales started selling, the price of Ethereum began to retreat from its $2,000 level, a natural market reaction to a substantial sell-off. This recent activity in the Ethereum market serves as a reminder of the significant influence whales can wield on crypto prices, often leading to sharp price fluctuations."}, {'id': 16, 'time': 'Sun, 16 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Celo blockchain proposes return to Ethereum ecosystem, transition to L2 - Cointelegraph', 'content': "CLabs, the organization responsible for developing the Celo blockchain, is seeking to return to the Ethereum ecosystem by transitioning from an independent EVM-compatible layer-1 blockchain to an Ethereum layer-2 solution.\n\nAccording to a proposal discussion on Celo‚Äôs governance forum, the transition would include leveraging OP Stack as the architecture to become an Ethereum L2 blockchain, eliminating the need to monitor tooling and libraries composability through upgrades, thus ‚Äúmaking it easy for Celo developers to utilize the full gambit of Ethereum tooling/libraries.‚Äù\n\nOther key differentiating factors would include an off-chain data availability layer operated by Ethereum node operators and protected by restaked Ether (ETH), along with transforming current validators into decentralized sequencers for L2.\n\nLayer-1 and Layer-2 blockchains differ primarily in purpose, but also in their design and architecture. While L1 networks are designed to be self-sufficient, L2 solutions are aimed at enhancing the performance of L1 blockchains rather than operating independently.\n\ncLabs proposed upgrade. Source: Celo's governance forum\n\nBenefits from the transition were said to include increased security while maintaining low gas fees. ‚ÄúWe expect no material change of gas fees. As the proposal is for an L2 solution with off-chain data availability, gas costs can be a lot lower than on other L2s,‚Äù reads the proposal, scheduled to be discussed on a governance call on July 21 before being released for a ‚Äútemperature check‚Äù on the following day.\n\nBy adopting the proposal, end-users would not be affected by the migration, and CELO tokenholders would retain control over core contracts by voting on governance proposals. Additionally, CELO tokens will also be used to pay for gas.\n\nAlthough the transition seems purely technical, it may affect the Celo ecosystem in different ways. As per the forum discussion, it could potentially enable more liquidity to flow between Celo and other chains but also generate extra costs for sequencers, such as fees on the data availability layer and gas on Ethereum. In addition, it is also unclear whether sequencers' rewards would match with current validators‚Äô rewards.\n\nWith blockchains becoming increasingly competitive, Celo has been working on improving its mobile experience by incorporating increased functionality and particular features. The Celo ecosystem is also targeting developing economies, where more technological solutions for payments are in demand.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Here‚Äôs how Ethereum‚Äôs ZK-rollups can become interoperable"}, {'id': 22, 'time': 'Sun, 16 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'This Week in Coins: XRP Leads Alt Week as Solana, Cardano and Polygon Outperform Bitcoin and Ethereum - Decrypt', 'content': 'Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt‚Äôs Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub.

While Ethereum is up by more than 60% year to date, it\'s still down significantly from the all-time high of $4,891.70 that it hit nearly two years ago. So it has plenty of potential upside.\n\nThat next big catalyst could be a blockchain upgrade that\'s tentatively scheduled to take place before the end of the year. In mid-2022, The Merge galvanized investors, and the crypto at one point rose 85% from the end of June to mid-August just before the upgrade took place in September. (The gain, of course, didn\'t last amid the brutal crypto winter.)\n\nCould this pending upgrade have a similarly positive impact?\n\nNot all tech upgrades are created equal\n\nAt the outset, it\'s important to differentiate between transformational upgrades and incremental upgrades. The Merge, which turned Ethereum from a proof-of-work blockchain into a proof-of-stake blockchain, was monumental. That helps to explain why there was so much investor excitement about The Merge.\n\nThe coming upgrade, known as Dencun (a mashup of "Cancun" and "Deneb"), will be more incremental. It has two goals: to reduce transaction fees on the Ethereum blockchain and to increase the network\'s throughput. In short, it will help Ethereum to run faster and cheaper, and that\'s certainly worthwhile. But is it really a big deal?\n\nThe answer will depend on how much of an impact Dencun has on blockchain performance. Right now, Ethereum\'s transaction fees (known as "gas fees") can become exorbitant during peak periods of demand. Thus, any change that brings down these fees significantly is certainly important. Moreover, Dencun is the next big step on Ethereum\'s path to becoming able to handle 100,000 transactions per second. That\'s a huge number. To put it into context, the Visa (V 1.20%) credit card network can handle about 65,000 transactions per second.\n\nThe big picture\n\nThe really exciting part, if you\'re a long-term crypto investor, is how the new upgrade fits into the bigger picture. Ethereum has planned a series of improvements as part of its long-term plan to ensure it remains a best-in-class blockchain. In November, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin released an updated roadmap for development, and Dencun is part of stage one of a five-stage process.\n\nTo put it another way, Ethereum is not resting on its laurels after The Merge. After this stage, which is known as The Surge, there will be The Scourge, The Verge, The Purge, and The Splurge. Even if each of these developmental stages lasts for only six months or so, that\'s still a solid two to three years more of regular improvements being made to the blockchain.\n\nShould you buy Ethereum?\n\nOn its own, Dencun might not be enough to make Ethereum soar. It\'s just an incremental change to help the blockchain run faster and smoother. Yes, it will improve scalability and efficiency, and it will introduce a new transaction type, but it\'s not a transformational change like The Merge.\n\nHowever, if you consider this tech upgrade as one step in a long-term process designed to make Ethereum a best-in-class blockchain, then it\'s an exciting story. Some crypto traders have even suggested that Ethereum could more than double in value to the $5,000 price level as a result of this upgrade.\n\nPersonally, I think that\'s expecting too much from this upgrade since the all-time high for Ethereum is just under $5,000, and that was during the peak of a huge bull market for risky assets like cryptocurrencies. But as more details about Dencun get released, and as more people understand how it could put Ethereum on the path to 100,000 transactions per second, then it\'s not out of the realm of possibility that the token will experience an extended rally heading into 2024. For that reason, I\'m bullish on Ethereum\'s prospects.'}, {'id': 1, 'time': 'Sun, 16 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Enterprise blockchain: 'Ethereum for Business' explains key use cases - Cointelegraph", 'content': 'The cryptocurrency market has encountered its share of ups and downs over the past year, but blockchain technology continues to see impressive growth as businesses seek digital transformation.\n\nRecent findings from the market research platform, MarketsandMarkets, estimated the global blockchain market size to be $7.4 billion in 2022. While notable, the report indicates that the blockchain sector is expected to generate $94 billion in revenue by the end of 2027. If these findings are accurate, this will result in a compound annual growth rate of 66% from 2022 to 2027.\n\nBreaking down ‚ÄòEthereum for Business‚Äô\n\nSpecifically speaking, many enterprises today are using the Ethereum blockchain to improve outdated business processes. Paul Brody, global blockchain leader for Ernst & Young (EY), told Cointelegraph that he believes the Ethereum network will drive the most growth for the enterprise blockchain market going forward.\n\nTo bring this to light, Brody recently published Ethereum for Business. According to Brody, this book intends to help non-technical, C-level executives and company leaders understand how and why Ethereum applies to specific use cases.\n\nBook cover. Source: University of Arkansas Press\n\nTo ease readers into the subject matter, Brody begins part one of the book by explaining how Ethereum works using relatable language. ‚ÄúThere are three foundational concepts that are useful to understand ‚Äî the distributed ledger, the programmable ledger, and consensus algorithm,‚Äù he writes. Brody then explains that every ‚Äúfinancial system has a ledger,‚Äù but notes that the difference between centralized, traditional systems and Ethereum is that ‚ÄúEthereum‚Äôs ledger is public and distributed to all participants.‚Äù\n\nThe first chapter also explains the terminology associated with blockchain networks. Brody writes that ‚Äúbatches of transactions are known as ‚Äòblocks.‚Äô‚Äù He ends the chapter by mentioning that the Ethereum network is often attractive to business users because it offers the ‚Äúconvenience of an integrated digital business‚Äù without a centralized market operator.\n\nBefore going in-depth on specific use cases, Brody spends the next few chapters of the book detailing terminology like wallets, tokens and smart contracts. For instance, in chapter four, he writes:\n\n‚ÄúIn Ethereum, both the money and the stuff can be represented as tokens, while the terms of the exchange between two parties can be captured in a smart contract.‚Äù\n\nBrody adds that everything of value is stored in a wallet when using the Ethereum blockchain: ‚ÄúWallets are just a name for a digital account where you can store your keys and the access rights to contacts and assets you control through those keys.‚Äù\n\nRecent: AI in healthcare: New tech in diagnosis and patient care\n\nChapter five focuses on oracles; as Brody mentions, ‚Äúenterprise transactions will require extensive use of oracles‚Äù since external data sources will be essential for completing smart contracts for business purposes.\n\nThe information presented at the beginning of Brody‚Äôs book is extremely useful for readers that may be new to the blockchain sector. The following chapters focus on concepts like privacy, which is a crucial consideration for enterprises leveraging blockchain.\n\nIn chapter six, Brody writes, ‚ÄúThough enterprises require privacy, blockchains do not, by default, offer privacy.‚Äù Given this, Brody focuses this section on privacy applications that can be applied to support enterprise transactions. Although Brody mentions at the beginning of the book that the read is not meant to promote EY‚Äôs blockchain work, he does detail how Nightfall and Starlight ‚Äî two privacy mechanisms created by EY ‚Äî are used by businesses to ensure private blockchain transactions.\n\nReal-world enterprise Ethereum use cases\n\nPart two of Brody‚Äôs book focuses on use cases and case studies. This section is probably the most interesting because it explains why the technology could be helpful for business processes.\n\nTokenization is heavily discussed in section two, with Brody writing that it is ‚Äúthe single most important thing enterprises can do in the blockchain space.‚Äù He adds that tokenization is often the first decision that firms using blockchain make since this can be used to digitize assets that can be easily tracked and managed.\n\nAlthough Brody explains the difference between ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens, he emphasizes that the ERC-1155 standard is gaining traction among enterprises due to its blend of fungible and nonfungible properties. Brody shares that an EY client in the pharmaceutical industry is currently using ERC-1155 tokens to track serialized medicine packages. ‚ÄúUsing the 1155 standard, this firm can mint large volumes of tokens and transfer them in big batches to distributors and others,‚Äù he writes.\n\nBrody continues sharing real-world examples of how EY clients apply the Ethereum blockchain. For instance, he explains how Italian beer producer Peroni uses blockchain for traceability, allowing consume...'}]

On the other hand, the news analyst report suggests a bullish market trend for Ethereum and other altcoins driven by technological advancements and positive regulatory developments. The upcoming tech upgrade for Ethereum is expected to improve scalability and efficiency, leading to increased demand for ETH.

In reflection, a moderately conservative approach focusing on long-term profitability and risk management has been effective in navigating the volatile ETH market. It is important to monitor on-chain metrics and news developments to capitalize on growth opportunities while managing risks effectively.

Considering the mixed signals in the market, it is advisable to maintain a moderately conservative trading approach to navigate uncertainties and capitalize on potential upward trends in the cryptocurrency market.

Therefore, I would take a slightly bullish stance with a trading action of 0.3, reflecting my confidence in the long-term positive market trend for ETH while also being mindful of potential short-term risks.

The funding round, led by prominent investment firm Dragonfly, demonstrates growing interest in Ethena's cutting-edge stablecoin project.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThus, in response to the challenges faced by previous stablecoin ventures, the start-up has developed a unique approach to ensuring its stablecoin, known as USDe, maintains a stable value relative to the U.S. dollar. By employing Ethereum derivatives and a hedging mechanism, Ethena aims to ensure that the value of USDe remains pegged to the dollar.\n\nThe difference\n\nThe key to this solution lies in the innovative use of collateral from users, allowing the platform to effectively hedge price exposure through shorting Ethereum via perpetual swaps. Through a balanced combination of staked ETH and derivatives, Ethena aims to neutralize any potential gains or losses, safeguarding the stability of USDe.\n\nThe start-up wants to distinguish itself from previous attempts at algorithmic stablecoins, such as the infamous Terra Luna. Moreover, Ethena's approach sets it apart from current stablecoin leaders USDC and USDT, which predominantly rely on traditional fiat-based assets like bills and bonds.\n\nThe success of Ethena's funding round is further amplified by the support it has garnered from prominent players in the cryptocurrency industry. Notable investors include big crypto exchanges and, additionally, Arthur Hayes. The founder of BitMEX and his family office have provided crucial backing to the project.

Discover SCENE\n\nzkSync is taking yet another step to decentralize.\n\nNamed after a mythical creature found in Lewis Carroll‚Äôs poem ‚ÄòThe Hunting of the Snark,‚Äô the team behind zkSync has launched the latest upgrade to the speedy layer-2 network.\n\nThe launch is in so-called mainnet shadow mode, per the team, as part of the launch's phased rollout. This mode is a testing zone that runs in parallel to the mainnet.\n\nzkSync is a novel scaling solution for Ethereum and one of the few that use zero-knowledge (zk) rollups to do so. Rollups come in two varieties: zk and optimistic. Both batch transactions off of the mainnet, roll them up into even smaller bundles, then those bundles are compressed into a proof, and settled on Ethereum.\n\nPart of that process involves a prover. This piece of technology is what does the compressing and packing of all those transactions. It's the cryptographic equivalent of a trash compactor, except it's not trash but potentially thousands of dollars in crypto activity.\n\nGiven the high computing power needed to generate those proofs, however, the barrier for users to participate is quite high.\n\nThe latest upgrade will address precisely this.\n\nCalled Boojum, which, per Carroll, is the most dangerous variety of Snark (itself a fictionalized creature), the tech will lower the hardware barrier to help secure zkSync.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe new prover can be operated with as little as 8 gigabytes of hardware, whereas the average prover demands roughly 500 gigabytes on average, said zkSync CEO Alex Gluchowski.\n\n‚ÄúSo far, we've seen the benchmark competitors indicating something like north of 500 gigabytes of RAM for a prover,‚Äù he told Decrypt. ‚ÄúAnd as you can only run it on the cloud, it's not ready for this [wide adoption]. Our prover requires only eight gigabytes of GPU RAM and it can run on GPUs that are compatible with gaming computers.‚Äù\n\nAlong with lowering the hardware demands, Boojum is also doing all its transaction compressing for much cheaper, too. Cutting costs here is crucial, even if it's only pennies.\n\n‚ÄúJust because a single transaction costs $1 to produce, or even 10 cents, or even less than that, getting through hundreds of thousands of transactions per second would mean massive expanding, and you will probably not have enough of the hardware in the vulnerable clusters to produce and sustain this load,‚Äù said Gluchowski.\n\nInstead of several large data centers supporting a blockchain network, especially one executing such taxing computations as generating cryptographic proofs, the upgraded prover will make it accessible to anyone.\n\nJust like miners on Bitcoin and validators on Ethereum are paid for securing their networks, so too would provers on zkSync, he said.\n\nThe zkSync CEO even argued that it could be a viable way to repurpose the mining industry.\n\n‚ÄúI personally don't think the proof of work will be a sustainable source of business,‚Äù he told Decrypt. ‚ÄúThey will have to shift to something that actually provides normally redundant value, not like waste kind of work. Actually like doing some useful work.‚Äù\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWith this step in the decentralization step executed, Gluchowski said that the next step is to decentralize zkSync‚Äôs sequencer. This piece of a blockchain is responsible for ordering transactions in each block.\n\nExecuting this step also suggests a token launch in the future, he told Decrypt.\n\n‚ÄúWhen you decentralized the sequencer, you will need some way to permissionlessly verify transactions,‚Äù said Gluchowski."}]

The wallet in question held 61,216 ETH worth around $116 million at the time of the transfer.\n\nüí§ üí§ üí§ üí§ üí§ üí§ üí§ üí§ üí§ üí§ A dormant pre-mine address containing 61,216 #ETH (116,396,127 USD) has just been activated after 8.0 years!https://t.co/f79T0fYa7b ‚Äî Whale Alert (@whale_alert) July 18, 2023\n\nThe wallet first made a small transfer of 0.05 ETH to crypto exchange Kraken, which was likely a test transaction before sending a larger amount. Shortly after, the user transferred the wallet‚Äôs entire balance to the exchange, prompting some market participants to speculate that millions of dollars‚Äô worth of sell pressure was due to hit the market for ETH.\n\nPre-mined ETH was issued as a reward to Ethereum‚Äôs early supporters, including those who funded the project during its Initial Coin Offering (ICO). The network started off with a supply of 72 million ETH, of which 83% was distributed to those who purchased the cryptocurrency in a crowd sale conducted in July and August 2014.\n\nThe crowd sale participants sent a total of 31,000 BTC to a designated Bitcoin address in exchange for an Ethereum wallet address to which the ETH they purchased would be distributed to after the network‚Äôs official launch.\n\nAccording to blockchain data analysed by CoinDesk, 6,600 transactions were sent to the Bitcoin address, although the consensus among industry watchers is that the true number of crowd sale participants is far smaller, with big players likely splitting their purchases into multiple wallets. The average purchase price of ETH amounted to $0.30 per coin for those that took part.\n\nWhile most early buyers sold off their coins as the price of ETH rose significantly over the years, the remaining pre-mine addresses were thought to be staunch supporters of the cryptocurrency or those that lost their private keys and could no longer access their wallets.\n\nIf the wallet‚Äôs owner does intend to sell, he or she will be cashing out on what is likely one of the largest returns on an initial investment in history.'}, {'id': 8, 'time': 'Tue, 18 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum: What $10B worth ETH burned means for the network - AMBCrypto News', 'content': 'The value of ETH burned since 2021 approached $10 billion.\n\nGas usage on the Ethereum network dropped due to low activity.\n\nSince the implementation of Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559 (EIP-1559), an upgrade aimed at improving the network‚Äôs transaction fee mechanism, Ethereum [ETH] has witnessed a significant amount of ETH being burned.\n\nRead Ethereum‚Äôs [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nThe mechanism, which reduces the supply of ETH, has resulted in the burning of nearly $10 billion worth of ETH tokens, Dune Analytics revealed.\n\nCoping with the hope\n\nImplemented in August 2021, the Ethereum team developed EIP-1559 as one of the London Hark Fork Improvement Proposals. This happened alongside EIP-3554, 3198, 3529, and EIP-3541.\n\nAll these developments happened in preparation for its transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS). For EIP-1559, the objective was to get rid of the previous fee market mechanism relating to its main gas fee calculation.\n\nWhile many users had hoped that the development would reduce gas fees on the network, it didn‚Äôt. Instead, it brought about a discrete base fee, aimed at prioritizing transactions when validating blocks.\n\nFurther information from Dune, the analytics platforms showed that projects like Uniswap [UNI], Circle [USDC], and NFT marketplace OpenSea, played vital roles in the increase.\n\nAt press time, nearly 300,00 ETH each had been burned via Uniswap and OpenSea. And the reason for this is clear. Uniswap maintained its position as the leading Decentralized Exchange (DEX).\n\nSo, a lot of ETH swaps with other tokens influenced its rise. For OpenSea, its place as the number on the Ethereum-based marketplace puts it in the aforementioned positions. As for USDC, its position as the favored stablecoin in DEXes helped up its rank.\n\nGas usage falls\n\nHowever, Ethereum gas used had decreased as of this writing. According to Santiment, the ETH gas used was 16.05 billion. Used gas usage spikes when there‚Äôs a lot of activity on the network.\n\nAnd this demand for ETH causes a rise in gas prices. So, the fall in usage reflects a relatively less busy period for the Ethereum network.\n\nOn looking at the network growth, the on-chain data provider revealed that the metric had decreased sharply. Typically, network growth measures the rate of adoption and influx of new users into a network.\n\nSo, when the network growth increases, it means that a project has impressive traction. However, when the metric decreases, it implies that utilization is low. And this is usually accompanied by low liquidity.\n\nIn conclusion, Ethereum‚Äôs burn mechanism has relatively addressed the network‚Äôs concerns around transaction fees.\n\nAlso, the substantial amount of ETH burned also demonstrates the demand and usage of the Ethereum network, as well as the effectiveness of creating a more deflationary ecosystem. Whether it will improve or not, time will tell.'}, {'id': 9, 'time': 'Tue, 18 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Vitalik Buterin Explains How Ethereum Plans to Make Crypto Wallets as Simple as Email - Decrypt', 'content': 'Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt‚Äôs Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nModern account abstraction is ‚Äúreally elegant‚Äù because it doesn‚Äôt require changes to the underlying protocol like other upgrades before it, said Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin at the Ethereum Community Conference (ETHCC) in Paris.\n\nDevelopers have been working on account abstraction, or different iterations of it, since 2015, even before Ethereum was launched. The idea is to switch from Externally Owned Wallets, or EOAs, to smart contract-based wallets. If they pull it off, managing a crypto wallet would become as easy as managing an email account.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat would mean users could potentially recover their seed phrase‚Äîthe private key used to sign trasnactions‚Äîas easily as they can reset the password on an email account.\n\nThe latest version is EIP-4337 (Ethereum Improvement Proposal 4337), also known as Account Abstraction Using Alt Mempool. The Ethereum (ETH) upgrade would allow users to create non-custodial wallets as programmable smart contracts. This would unlock a number of features, such as easy wallet recovery, signless transactions‚Äìwhich translates into lower transaction fees‚Äìand team wallets (also known as multisignature wallets).\n\nAccording to Buterin, the upgrade could be one of the driving catalysts for Web3 adoption around the world. ‚ÄúOne of the key properties we want blockchains to have is that they give you money before you register,‚Äù he said.\n\nThe idea, he said, is for users to be able to receive any token, like a stablecoin, that isn‚Äôt Ethereum with their smart contract wallet and be able to pay the gas fees without having to converthold ETH.\n\nIn order to allow for these types of wallets and transactions to be broadcasted, the latest account abstraction upgrade would enable the use of ‚Äúpaymasters,‚Äù which allow users to pay for gas fees with whatever token they are transacting with.\n\nEIP-4337 also incorporates signature aggregators‚Äîwhich allow for multiple signers to join together, and only one gets used in a transaction.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nButerin claimed today that ‚Äúthis is a pretty big deal,‚Äù especially in rollups, due to the outsized footprint of a signature on these types of layer 2 solutions. Ethereum layer 2 scaling solutions, like Arbitrum or Optimism, batch transactions together and verify them off the Ethereum mainnet. Account abstraction would allow for signature aggregation. In simple terms, that would allow for more data compression, which translates into cheaper computation, and according to the Ethereum co-founder, ‚Äúwill reduce costs by 86 times.‚Äù\n\nThis is not the only Ethereum upgrade currently in the works. Proto-danksharding, or EIP-4884 is also underway. It‚Äôs quickly become one of the main focuses of development on the network because it sets the foundation for a new data type which will drastically reduce costs and make data usage more efficient.'}, {'id': 3, 'time': 'Tue, 18 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Crypto survey finds 47% of investors expect Ether to 'surpass' Bitcoin - Cointelegraph", 'content': 'Fidelity Digital Assets released a ‚ÄúQ2 2023 Signals Report‚Äù on July 18, which claimed that Ether‚Äôs outlook for the next 12 months and the long term is positive. Year-to-date, Ether (ETH) has gained 62%, but while the investment firm might be short-term bullish on Ether, that does not mean it believes that the month-long bullish channel will be sustained.\n\nWhile institutional investors like Fidelity Digital Assets may have a bullish longer-term vision for ETH\'s price, let‚Äôs compare their analysis against network and market data to see if they‚Äôre on the money.\n\nEther/USD 1-day price index. Source: TradingView\n\nBeyond the technical indicators, the rationale behind Fidelity‚Äôs bullish outlook for Ether is the network‚Äôs higher burn rate versus coin issuance, the ‚Äúnew address momentum‚Äù and a growth in the number of network validators.\n\nFidelity ‚ÄúQ2 2023 Signals Report,‚Äù July 18. Source: Fidelity Digital Assets\n\nAccording to the Fidelity report, the net issuance since the Merge in September 2022 resulted in a net supply decrease of more than 700,000 Ether. Additionally, the analysts claim that Glassnode data showing an increasing number of Ethereum addresses that transacted for the first time ever proves healthy network adoption.\n\nThe report also points to a 15% increase in the number of active Ethereum validators in the second quarter.\n\nThe expectation around EIP-1153 is also building momentum for the Ethereum network, as the ‚Äútransient storage opcode‚Äù improves smart contract efficiency, reduces costs and amplifies the Ethereum Virtual Machine design. The change is especially meaningful for decentralized exchanges (DEXs), where Ethereum‚Äôs dominance declined to 46% from 60% six months prior, according to DefiLlama data.\n\nDencun upgrade expected to reduce transaction costs\n\nAnother potentially bullish factor for the Ethereum network is the anticipated upgrade on the leading DEX, Uniswap. According to a July 17 presentation at the Ethereum Community Conference, the upcoming Uniswap v4 will allow users to build unlimited types of pools using programmable buttons (hooks), native ETH support and a singleton contract that performs internal transactions before settling final balances.\n\nThe announcement fueled the likelihood that EIP-1153 will be included in the next ‚ÄúDencun‚Äù upgrade, which triggered Slingshot and DeFi Pulse co-founder Scott Lewis.\n\ni had missed the news that uniswap labs got eip1153 into cancun.\n\n\n\nthey kept the details for wanting eip1153 secret from the community, only publishing v4 only after inclusion was finalized.\n\n\n\ninformal governance captured by an insider-aligned, for-profit monopoly. sad day. ‚Äî scottlewis.canto‚ûï (@scott_lew_is) June 13, 2023\n\nIf approved, the implementation will be vital for the Ethereum network to recoup the market share lost due to high gas fees, as the seven-day average transaction cost has been above $4 since February. Consequently, Ethereum‚Äôs total value locked has dropped to its lowest level since April 2020, at 13.55 million ETH, according to DefiLlama.\n\nMoreover, decentralized application activity has dwindled, as shown by DappRadar‚Äôs unique active wallets‚Äô 30-day data: Uniswap, minus 28%; 1inch Network, minus 14%; MetaMask Swap, minus 8%; and OpenSea, minus 5%. As a comparison, in the same period, BNB Smart Chain‚Äôs PancakeSwap gained 10%, and Polygon‚Äôs Uniswap users increased 8%.\n\nDerivatives metrics remain flat\n\nEther quarterly futures have been signaling unease among professional traders. Those fixed-month contracts typically trade at a 5% to 10% premium compared to spot markets to compensate for the delayed settlement, a situation known as contango.\n\nEther 3-month futures premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nAccording to data from Laevitas, the Ether three-month futures premium currently stands at 4%, which is below the neutral threshold and lower than the 5.5% level seen on July 14. This indicator is clear evidence that traders are less inclined to use leverage for bullish ETH positions.\n\nMore concerningly, Ether‚Äôs 59% gains year-to-date might have caused investors to become overly optimistic. A recent survey from CryptoVantage of 1,000 North Americans that invested in cryptocurrencies over the past five years found that 46% named Ether as the top contender to surpass Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nRelated: Bitcoin rally will lead to "speculative blow-off top‚Äù in 2024, Mark Yusko predicts\n\nCoins with the best chances of surpassing Bitcoin. Source: 2023 CryptoVantage survey\n\nThis is a somewhat startling point of view, but it could be misleading since the survey did not ask whether any coin would eventually flip Bitcoin, so respondents don‚Äôt necessarily place strong odds on this outcome.\n\nFidelity‚Äôs analysis has given valid reasons for why the firm is bullish on Ether‚Äôs 12-month price performance, but in the shorter term, the recurrent high gas fees and lack of interest from leverage buyers signal increased odds of the Ether price breaking below the channel support.\n\nThis article is for gene...'}, {'id': 5, 'time': 'Tue, 18 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum Developers Are Discussing The Plan For The Dencun Upgrade - The Crypto Basic', 'content': 'Not that long ago, the Ethereum blockchain underwent the Shanghai and Capella upgrades; the former impacted ETH‚Äôs execution layer, while the latter targeted the Consensus Layer. The network upgrades seem to have pushed Ethereum‚Äôs price higher, attracting a lot of investors (and speculators) in the cryptocurrency market. If you haven‚Äôt considered this asset class in the past, it‚Äôs high time you take ETH seriously. As you learn more about how to buy Ethereum, you‚Äôll find that it‚Äôs better to purchase tokens on an exchange; it‚Äôs your responsibility to pay the gas fees.\n\nEthereum‚Äôs developers have proven they‚Äôre committed to steadily improving the network. The much-awaited Shapella Upgrade is live, and ETH has many more upgrades in the pipeline to enhance scalability, security, and sustainability. Surprising or not, developers are preparing for the upcoming upgrade on the Ethereum Mainnet, the Dencun upgrade, that will reduce transaction fees, expected in late 2023. If all goes as hoped, it will enable new use cases. According to Tim Beiko, Protocol Support for the Ethereum Foundation, the developers are in the final stages of planning for Dencun, having a provisional set of EIPs.\n\nWhat‚Äôs New in The Recent Ethereum Upgrade?\n\nThe Dencun upgrade combines two upgrades, namely Deneb (the Execution Layer upgrade) and Cancun (the Consensus Layer upgrade). Some of the main improvement proposals considered for inclusion are:\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nEIP-4844 . Also referred to as Proto-Danksharding, EIP-4844 introduces temporary ‚Äúdata blobs‚Äù to the Beacon Chain for a short period of time. The format will be fully compatible with that used in full sharding. This proposal will lower the gas cost of Layer 2 transactions considerably.

This proposal brings about two new opcodes, namely TSTORE and TLOAD, which enable storage to be used provisionally.

SSZ structures with optional values can be represented with the idiomatic types of the underlying programming languages. Using simple serialize encoding, developers guarantee transaction formats are forward-compatible.\n\nBesides the EIPs that are formally part of the Dencun upgrade, client teams have proposals that might be included. Let‚Äôs take EIP-2537 as an example. It focuses on the BLS12-381 curve, used for signatures within Ethereum 2.0. There‚Äôs no denying that Dencun is an essential step in Ethereum‚Äôs development, but let‚Äôs not forget that it‚Äôs still a work in progress.\n\nEthereum Is Undergoing a Period of Tremendous Transformation\n\nPeople are becoming increasingly comfortable with blockchain technology, and the more they use it, the more they rely on it. As Ethereum advances, we continue to see more changes; it‚Äôs hard, if not impossible, to anticipate its next move. Over the years, ETH has managed to adapt as new ideas have emerged from research and development, positioning itself as a powerful contender in the cryptocurrency industry. It faces regular updates meant to improve its technical capabilities, mainly realized with hard forks.

In June 2014, the Ethereum ecosystem held a sale event that gave early team members and co-founders the chance to take part and gather pre-mined Ether.\n\nThe tokens are now worth more than $116 million eight years later. Although the wallet owner's identity and the motivations behind the money transfer are unclear, they could be due to a variety of reasons, such as profiting from the rise in Ethereum's price.\n\nTo avoid any loss brought on by human error, the wallet's owner sent a test transaction worth 0.05 ETH to the Kraken address before starting the whole transaction. Despite the size of the transfer, the fee for the transaction was only $1.5, and the gas price was 25.475673161 gwei."}, {'id': 3, 'time': 'Wed, 19 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum ICO participant awakens after 8 years, moves $116M to Kraken - The Block', 'content': "A participant in Ethereum's initial coin offering (ICO) has resurfaced after remaining dormant for over eight years.

One ETH is currently trading at over $1,900.\n\nThe Ethereum ICO participant was inactive for more than 2900 days.

Such movements to crypto exchanges often indicate an intention to sell an asset, stake it or acquire other assets. The ETH price remains unaffected by the transfer, with the asset continuing its upward trend.\n\nSeveral dormant crypto holders have moved funds in recent months.

Also in April, a bitcoin (BTC) whale that had been inactive for a decade transferred 279 BTC ‚Äî worth $7.8 million at the time of the transaction ‚Äî to three new addresses.

That's where Cymbal sees an opening.\n\nIt takes the same kind of public blockchain data that‚Äôs flowing through standard explorers and turns it into a feed that‚Äôs not only visual and easily understandable at a glance, but also social.\n\n‚ÄúToday, tools like Etherscan are the best in class for looking at the blockchain‚Äîbut they resemble command line interfaces. We want to get to the GUI,‚Äù Cymbal CEO and co-founder Eric Feng told Decrypt, alluding to the past computing shift from text-based navigation to graphical user interfaces.\n\nCymbal looks more like a social network than a pure data resource, serving up dashboards that take transaction details and wrap them up with NFT artwork‚Äîfrom the Bored Ape Yacht Club and other top collections‚Äîalong with data trends, public information on known wallet owners, relevant news stories from media outlets, and more.\n\nIt also runs that data through an AI tool to generate a conversational summary of transactions and trends, to make things even more understandable for the average user. Feng said that Cymbal is running the tool through OpenAI‚Äôs GPT large language model.\n\nCymbal is launching with a focus on NFTs, but Feng said that richer data regarding cryptocurrency and token transactions will be added in time, as his team works to ‚Äúbuild out a full Etherscan replacement.‚Äù Support for the Solana blockchain is coming in a matter of weeks, he added, with Ethereum scaling network Polygon not far behind.\n\nFeng said that Cymbal started with NFTs for a couple of reasons. The tokens are often tied to artwork, which makes them visual in nature‚Äîideal for this kind of platform. NFTs are also often the first way that people are onboarded into the crypto space these days, he added, and that accessibility layer also played a role in Cymbal‚Äôs decision-making.\n\nStory continues\n\n‚ÄúWe consider NFTs to be the gateway to Web3,‚Äù he told Decrypt.\n\nA screenshot of the Cymbal interface. Image: Cymbal\n\nCymbal looks like a social network, and it can be used like one too. Users can follow wallets and projects, plus wallet owners can claim their own page and then personalize it to become a ‚ÄúWeb3 profile‚Äù of sorts, Feng said. He suggested potential messaging, content publishing, and other social features to come in time.\n\nThe startup has raised a total of $18.5 million to date with notable investors in the mix, including Coinbase Ventures, Solana Ventures, CAA Connect, UTA Ventures, Shima Capital, and Google Ventures (GV). Notable angel investors include Kleiner Perkins‚Äô John Doerr, Dapper Labs co-founder Roham Gharegozlou, and outgoing Polygon Labs president Ryan Wyatt.\n\nFeng‚Äîa former CTO at Hulu and veteran of Meta and Microsoft‚Äîsaid that Cymbal sees revenue-generating opportunities with targeted advertising based on wallet data, along with selling its curated data to app builders via API access. He said it‚Äôs akin to business models used by other block explorers, as well as crypto price trackers.\n\nOpepen PFPs Are Taking Over NFT Twitter‚ÄîHere's What's Going On\n\nCymbal is positioned as a way to not only help the average NFT and crypto user better understand the blockchain space, but also help expand the industry as more accessible tools come online.\n\n‚ÄúThere is a subset of hardcore crypto people that can read Etherscan, just like there's people in ‚ÄòThe Matrix‚Äô that could look at the green squiggly lines and understand what's going on,‚Äù Feng told Decrypt. ‚ÄúGreat. This is not for them.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt's for the masses,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúIt's not the tens of thousands of hardcore crypto people right now. It's for the tens of millions of people that hopefully will come into the ecosystem if we can create better tooling for them.‚Äù"}, {'id': 0, 'time': 'Wed, 19 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Will Ethereum Be a Trillion-Dollar Cryptocurrency by 2025? - The Motley Fool', 'content': 'Currently trading at just under $2,000, Ethereum (ETH 0.42%) has a market capitalization of $227 billion, making it the world\'s second-largest cryptocurrency. Ethereum now accounts for about 20% of the entire value of the $1.2 trillion crypto market.\n\nSo what would it take for Ethereum to more than quadruple in value to become a trillion-dollar cryptocurrency? For one, it would require Ethereum to continue to find innovative use cases for its blockchain technology. Second, it would most likely require Ethereum to surpass Bitcoin (BTC 0.56%) as the world\'s most popular cryptocurrency. Let\'s take a closer look at both of these factors.\n\nPost-Merge roadmap\n\nThe good news is that Ethereum\'s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, has plenty of upgrades, changes, and tweaks planned for the cryptocurrency. At the end of November 2022, he released an updated roadmap for Ethereum, and it\'s impressive. According to Buterin, Ethereum\'s transformation is still only 55% complete, even after last year\'s landmark upgrade known as The Merge. There are five big upgrade stages ahead, known as the Surge, Scourge, Verge, Purge, and Splurge.\n\nThe big question, of course, is what types of innovative use cases will emerge from each of these upgrades. In April, we saw the completion of one such upgrade, known as Shapella, which made crypto staking on the platform much more attractive to investors. The next big upgrade, now scheduled for the end of 2023, could lead to Ethereum being able to support 100,000 transactions per second in the near-term future. That type of raw processing speed would make Ethereum much more attractive to both users and developers.\n\nEthereum has a strong track record of innovation, and each new improvement to the blockchain typically leads to a completely unexpected new use case scenario. Thus, if there are five upgrades ahead, that\'s five new opportunities for new breakthrough innovations. Ethereum\'s post-Merge roadmap might be incredibly wonky, filled with terms like "proto-danksharding," but I think it could be the key to unlocking this crypto\'s full valuation potential.\n\nCan Ethereum flip Bitcoin?\n\nIn crypto circles, one hypothetical scenario is known as "the flippening." This is the moment when Ethereum finally surpasses Bitcoin as the world\'s most valuable cryptocurrency. Throughout its history, Ethereum has always played second fiddle to Bitcoin in terms of market capitalization. At some point, though, Ethereum could eventually "flip" Bitcoin.\n\nMost likely, Ethereum will need to surpass Bitcoin for it to become a trillion-dollar cryptocurrency. Until it happens, the math simply doesn\'t work. Investors can\'t assume that the entire crypto market is going to increase in value at the same rate as Ethereum. The math only works if Ethereum gains market share from other cryptos such as Bitcoin.\n\nThere are several factors in Ethereum\'s favor here. A big one is Ethereum\'s smart contract platform, which gives it much greater utility than Bitcoin. With Ethereum, the number of use cases includes non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, the metaverse, and Web3. And just about every new technological innovation -- such as artificial intelligence -- is better suited to running on Ethereum than Bitcoin. Thus, in the near-term future, it is likely that Ethereum will grow faster than Bitcoin.\n\nMoreover, thanks to The Merge, Ethereum is now a modern proof-of-stake blockchain, while Bitcoin is still an old proof-of-work blockchain. That means Ethereum no longer requires crypto mining, and that makes the blockchain 99.9% more energy efficient. Given the debate on the environment and climate change, this is a big deal. For example, in September 2022, the White House released a detailed study on the harmful environmental effects of Bitcoin mining. As people become more aware of the environmental effects of different cryptos, it might lead to more investors moving their money out of Bitcoin and into Ethereum.\n\nThe path to $1 trillion\n\nWhile Ethereum definitely has a path to a $1 trillion market cap, the road will not be easy. Consider, for example, that only a handful of stocks currently have trillion-dollar market valuations. Getting to this valuation for Ethereum would represent a real milestone, and one that will likely require overcoming a number of regulatory obstacles along the way.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, I\'m bullish on Ethereum\'s medium- to long-term prospects. Within the next few years, it is entirely within the realm of possibility that Ethereum will become a trillion-dollar cryptocurrency as long as it continues to execute on its roadmap for growth.'}]

The entire ETH holding, which is now worth around $116.9 million, cost the whale slightly less than $19,000 at the time of the ICO.\n\nEthereum is trading at $1,910 at time of writing.\n\nWhile the mysterious wallet now holds zero Ethereum, there are numerous other tokens that it owns.\n\nDuring Ethereum‚Äôs ICO more than 50 million ETH were sold raising around $17.3 million at the time.

He told Decrypt that Ordinals provides a new way for the firm to use its fleet of data-center-grade Nvidia GPUs, which it‚Äôs been using to mine altcoins after Ethereum switched to proof-of-stake during the ‚Äúmerge‚Äù and made miners obsolete.\n\n‚ÄúWe will create generative AI art with our own GPUs, on our own fine-tuned model of Stable Diffusion, [...] and then use our hash power on the Bitcoin network to inscribe those on the Bitcoin blockchain,‚Äù he said.\n\nWhat Is 'The Merge'? Ethereum‚Äôs Move to Proof of Stake\n\nOrdinals launched earlier this year, and the buzzy Bitcoin protocol has led to a wave of innovation with crypto‚Äôs oldest coin. As a way for people to create NFT-like assets on Bitcoin by ‚Äúinscribing‚Äù data on individual satoshi, equal to 1/100,000,000 of a whole Bitcoin, Ordinals has also been a significant windfall for Bitcoin miners that benefit from elevated transaction fees.\n\nEven though Bitcoin transaction fees from Ordinals inscriptions have cooled over the past couple of months‚Äîfervor surrounding BRC-20 tokens, which are built on top of Bitcoin using Ordinals, sent them sky high‚ÄîKilic said HIVE is definitely ‚Äústill leaning into them.‚Äù\n\nKilic compared the initiative to jet fighter squadrons like the Blue Angels who show off their skills by flying in tight formations. He described HIVE‚Äôs project as ambitious because it taps so many different segments of HIVE‚Äôs business, including its cloud computing platforms and custom versions of AI models like Stable Diffusion.\n\nBitcoin Mining Revenue Hits $184 Million in Q2 Amid Ordinals Fervor\n\n‚ÄúWe want to do a soup-to-nuts AI and Ordinals project that‚Äôs fully integrated,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a reflection of our core competencies as a technology leader in the AI and Bitcoin space.‚Äù\n\nStory continues\n\nAside from creating a digital art pipeline, Kilic said HIVE is working with its custody providers to start transacting uncommon sats found through Ordinals. Uncommon sats, which are valued at a premium, are the first sat of each Bitcoin block. Kilic said HIVE has 272 of them. Sat is a common abbreviation for satoshi, the smallest denomination of Bitcoin that data is inscribed on.\n\nWhen Ethereum shifted to proof-of-stake last year, it changed the way that transactions are verified on the network and greatly reduced its energy consumption. With Bitcoin, miners use large amounts of energy to verify transactions through proof-of-work.\n\nEthereum Energy Usage, Carbon Footprint Down 99.99% After Merge: Report\n\nAfter Ethereum‚Äôs transition to proof-of-stake, HIVE said it was exploring alternatives to Ethereum mining. Developing a generative art pipeline using new technologies fits into HIVE‚Äôs overall corporate strategy of maximizing resources, Kilic said.\n\nHIVE went public in 2017 and trades on the TSX Venture Exchange in Canada under the HIVE.V symbol. It has also traded on the Nasdaq since 2021 under the HIVE symbol. Shares of HIVE currently change hands at $5.66, and the company has a market capitalization of around $477 million.\n\nEchoing comments made by MicroStrategy co-founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor, who said Ordinals holds potential in the realm of app development, Kilic said the protocol enables companies like HIVE to experiment with Bitcoin in previously unimagined ways.\n\n‚ÄúI think that it‚Äôs unleashing a whole new era,‚Äù Kilic said. ‚ÄúWe're all super supportive of it.‚Äù"}, {'id': 7, 'time': 'Thu, 20 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Introducing Bitrock - A Revolutionary Ethereum IBFT 2.0 Side Chain with Multichain DEX Swap - Yahoo Finance', 'content': "Bitrock\n\nROERMOND, NETHERLANDS , July 20, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bitrock , an Ethereum IBFT 2.0 Proof of Authority (PoA) side chain, is pleased to announce its official launch as a game-changing layer 2 solution in the blockchain industry.

This was confirmed by Arltduv, a Crypto Directory in a Twitter Post on July 20, 2023.\n\nThese incidents have had a negative impact on user confidence and contributed to the decline in the overall value locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols, with Ether-based protocols accounting for more than 90% of the total TVL.\n\nEthereum‚Äôs Daily Active Addresses Decline\n\nIn addition to the revenue decline, Ethereum‚Äôs daily active addresses experienced a notable drop of 6% during Q2 2023. The metric measures the number of unique wallet addresses that have conducted transactions on the Ether blockchain per day during the quarter. Despite the ongoing bear market, the decline in daily active addresses hasn‚Äôt worsened significantly, indicating a level of resilience in user activity.\n\nETH price resting at $1,891 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nEthereum‚Äôs performance during the second quarter suggests that while it faced challenges in network revenue and daily user engagement, the platform remains a key player in the DeFi space. The continuous efforts to improve the network‚Äôs usability and scalability are crucial in attracting a broader user base, as demonstrated by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin‚Äôs recent proposal.\n\nETH Still King Of DeFi\n\nDespite the decline in daily users and network revenue, Ethereum has managed to maintain its spot as the leading blockchain when it comes to DeFi activity. The network currently accounts for more than 50% of Total Value Locked (TVL) across all blockchains, establishing it as the leader in this regard.\n\nLayer 2 blockchains such as Arbitrum and Polyon built atop the Ethereum network are also doing incredibly well. Arbitrum is currently sitting at $2.649 billion in TVL, with Polygon trailing behind at $1.044 billion in TVL.\n\nIn terms of price, ETH is still closely following the performance of Bitcoin. The altcoin is trading at $1,892 at the time of this writing, with meager gains of 0.07% in the last day.\n\nFeatured image from Yahoo Finance, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

However, the MACD histogram oscillates below the zero line, implying a slight bearish sentiment among investors.\n\nAdditionally, the 50-day exponential moving average aligns around $1,920, with Ethereum‚Äôs price moving above and below this level, reflecting investor indecisiveness.\n\nEthereum Price Chart ‚Äì Source: Tradingview\n\nShould Ethereum surpass the $1,920 level, it holds the potential to target resistance at $1,945 or $1,975, indicating a continuation of the upward trend.\n\nConversely, a bearish breakdown below $1,900 could lead to a price decline towards $1,880 or even lower to $1,845.\n\nIn conclusion, closely monitoring the $1,900 level is essential, as a decisive move above or below this point could signal a shift in the market trend.\n\nTop 15 Cryptocurrencies to Watch in 2023\n\nStay informed about the latest initial coin offering (ICO) projects and alternative cryptocurrencies by regularly exploring our carefully selected collection of the top 15 digital assets to watch in 2023.\n\nThis thoughtfully curated list has been compiled by industry experts from Industry Talk and Cryptonews, ensuring that you receive professional recommendations and valuable insights.\n\nStay ahead of the game and discover the potential of these cryptocurrencies as you navigate the ever-changing world of digital assets.\n\nFind The Best Price to Buy/Sell Cryptocurrency\n\nCryptocurrency Price Tracker ‚Äì Source: Cryptonews\n\nDisclaimer: Cryptocurrency projects endorsed in this article are not the financial advice of the publishing author or publication ‚Äì cryptocurrencies are highly volatile investments with considerable risk, always do your own research.'}, {'id': 1, 'time': 'Fri, 21 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Ethereum (ETH): You Don't Want to Miss This Pattern - U.Today", 'content': "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecently, Ethereum has entered the ascending price channel, a pattern typically associated with an ongoing bullish trend. An ascending channel is characterized by two parallel trend lines, both slanting upward at the same angle, with the price oscillating between the upper and lower bounds.\n\nCurrently, Ethereum is situated at the lower border of this channel. In previous instances, a touch at the lower trend line within this pattern often precedes a rally toward the upper boundary. If Ethereum follows this pattern, we could expect a bullish move in the near future.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that Ethereum recently experienced a breakdown from the $2,000 level, a psychological barrier for many traders. This could apply some downward pressure on ETH. Yet, the current position on the ascending channel's lower border may provide enough support to counteract this bearish factor.\n\nAdditionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) - a popular momentum indicator - is presently hovering around the neutral 50 mark for Ethereum. This level often serves as a demarcation line between bullish and bearish market conditions. Notably, the RSI is maintaining its level above 50, implying that the prevailing uptrend could still have some steam.\n\nLastly, Ethereum's recent volatility appears to be lower than usual. In the world of cryptocurrencies, a decrease in volatility can often be a precursor to a significant price movement. A sudden surge in volatility could therefore potentially trigger a strong price swing for Ethereum.\n\nShiba Inu is asleep\n\nIn the world of meme cryptocurrencies, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has held a significant place, with a community that is known for its zeal and resilience. However, recent market trends suggest dampening energy surrounding this token, with volatility significantly waning, putting SHIB in an anemic state.\n\nSHIB recently encountered a critical resistance level, which typically represents a price point that an asset struggles to break above due to heightened selling pressure. Unfortunately, as it stands, the token is experiencing a rapid reduction in volatility.\n\nAn asset without volatility may become less attractive for traders looking to capitalize on price swings. Therefore, the diminishing volatility of SHIB could lead to a potential increase in selling pressure, which is the last thing SHIB needs at this crucial juncture.\n\nThe current status of SHIB paints a picture of a token that is losing momentum. Unless the scenario changes - with an influx of positive news or an increase in its adoption - the current anemic state could continue.\n\nPEPE's bounce is possible\n\nThe meme-based cryptocurrency market has often showcased its unpredictable nature, with sudden price movements keeping investors and traders on their toes. One such crypto asset, Pepe (PEPE), a popular meme token, has been showing signs of a potential upward price trajectory. PEPE has once again touched its local low at approximately $0.0000015, an event that has historically led to price reversals.\n\nThis local low coincides with a 50 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) support level, as well as a support line on the token's local trend. The Exponential Moving Average is a type of weighted moving average that gives more weight to the latest data. In PEPE's case, the token's price has come to rest on this 50 EMA line, suggesting that it could potentially be in for a price boost.\n\nMoreover, this is not the first time such a price pattern has been noticed for PEPE. In the past, similar falls to this threshold have led to relatively swift price reversals. If the past is any indicator, and if the pattern continues to hold true, PEPE may be poised for a 10% run upward from its current position.\n\nOf course, any such prediction is contingent on a number of factors, including overall market sentiment, investor interest and the general performance of meme-based cryptocurrencies. With that said, the recent trend and historical data for PEPE give investors some cause for optimism."}]

(Ethereum Price Analysis) - CryptoPotato', 'content': 'Ethereum buyers have been struggling to push the price above the significant resistance region of $2K. Nevertheless, the price is currently navigating a crucial range bounded by that level and the dynamic support provided by the 100-day moving average.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nOn June 21st, Ethereum managed to surpass the 100-day moving average and continued its prevailing uptrend after a pullback, eventually reaching the critical resistance area at $2K. Yet, the bullish momentum faded due to increased selling pressure around this level, resulting in minor rejections.\n\nNevertheless, the price finds support at the 100-day MA, currently situated at $1,867, which has prevented further declines over the past few weeks. A breakout from this significant price range will likely play a pivotal role in determining Ethereum‚Äôs overall prospects in the mid-term.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nUpon analyzing the 4-hour timeframe, a bearish trend for Ethereum becomes evident as the price broke below its multi-week upward trendline after facing rejection at the $2K resistance zone. A subsequent pullback confirmed the breakout.\n\nAt present, ETH remains confined between two critical price levels: the static resistance at $2K and the critical support at $1,850. This suggests the potential for a range-bound market stage characterized by consolidation candles and the absence of a strong trend.\n\nThe price is expected to remain within this range until a breakout occurs, revealing the upcoming direction for Ethereum.\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe provided chart displays the Estimated Leverage Ratio in correlation with ETH‚Äôs price. This metric gauges the average leverage employed by participants in the futures market. Generally, higher values indicate more investors are taking on greater leverage and risk in the derivatives market.\n\nIn recent weeks, the Estimated Leverage Ratio has seen a slight increase, suggesting that the futures market may be getting overheated due to the recent bullish price trends. However, it hasn‚Äôt reached concerning levels yet. Nonetheless, if the metric continues to surge, caution is advised as it could lead to a short or long-squeeze event.\n\nIn such a scenario, Ethereum‚Äôs price could experience a sudden and significant movement.'}, {'id': 5, 'time': 'Sat, 22 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Solana To Skyrocket by Over 870% Once Ethereum‚Äôs Bull Run Starts, Predicts Crypto Analyst ‚Äì Here‚Äôs the Timeline - The Daily Hodl', 'content': "A widely followed crypto analyst believes that Solana (SOL) will come close to its all-time highs once Ethereum (ETH) kicks off its bull market.\n\nIn a new strategy session, the host of InvestAnswers tells his 446,000 YouTube subscribers that Solana could go up to $250, an increase of more than 870% from its current price of $25.75.\n\nAccording to the pseudonymous analyst, Solana‚Äôs rise will likely be triggered by Ethereum‚Äôs Cancun upgrade, which is expected to further elevate the leading smart contract platform‚Äôs scalability.

But what has been driving this bearish retracement?\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nOutflows from whale addresses may have largely contributed to ETH‚Äôs downside. A recent Glassnode alert offered some confirmation. It revealed that the number of addresses holding 100 or more ETH recently fell to their lowest level in the last eight years.\n\nThe Glassnode alert warrants a look at whether other whale categories have been contributing to sell pressure. We found that addresses holding at least 1,000 ETH and those above the 10,000 ETH (Denoted by blue and black respectively) have been trimming their balances.\n\nIn other words, they have been contributing to the downside.\n\nWe also found something interesting.

This is during the same period that whales have been selling off some of their ETH.\n\nIn other words, ETH‚Äôs price action in the last few weeks has been significantly influenced by whale games.\n\nOne in the chamber?\n\nWe looked into the supply distribution which collaborates with the Glassnode address activity analysis above. However, we observed that addresses holding over 10 million ETH have been growing during the month.\n\nIn addition, the same whale category controls the second largest share of ETH in circulating supply.\n\nIt was unclear whether the aforementioned address category represented private addresses or exchange addresses. Aside from that, addresses holding between 1,000 and 100,000 ETH shifted in favor of accumulation in the last 24 hours.\n\nAlso, investor confidence remained favorable for the bulls, judging by the steady rise in weighted sentiment.\n\nETH‚Äôs MVRV ratio has also been steadily rising during the last four months and was at its highest level during the same period.

The proof-of-work (PoW) consensus was used by Ethereum for the first seven years of its life, much like Bitcoin.\n\nThe network's security was then derived from the enormous quantities of energy needed to solve mathematical puzzles, as any attacker would have to obtain 51% of the chain's energy usage, which is a nearly impossible feat.\n\nEthereum is now secured by stakers rather than miners. To be a validator, which is in charge of ensuring the validity of new blocks, stakers must stake 32 ETH.\n\nConsensus mechanisms, which allow a decentralized network to confidently decide which blocks to add to the chain, are the most important aspect of any blockchain's security. If the consensus mechanism is exploited, as might happen in a 51% attack, the chain could suffer irreparable harm.\n\nEthereum Deneb/Cancun testing efforts progress\n\nChristine Kim summarizes the Ethereum ACDE call, a twice-weekly conference call where Ethereum client teams debate and plan updates to the Ethereum execution layer (EL).\n\nThis week, developers talked about DevNet 8 planning and some adjustments to Deneb/Cancun EIPs.

These significant asset movements have suggested a potential price dip for ETH.\n\nCoinGecko data shows that the second-largest cryptocurrency has been experiencing a slight price decline, losing 2.5% of its value in the past week. As of this writing, the Ether token changes hand at $1,892.65, with a negligible 0.2% gain in the last 24 hours.\n\nEthereum Registers $383 Million Worth Of ETH In CEX Inflows\n\nAccording to data from IntoTheBlock, Ethereum witnessed the largest inflows into centralized exchanges in the past two months. The data analytics platform found that at least $383 million worth of ETH was deposited into these exchanges.\n\nIntoTheBlock also revealed that a significant percentage of the CEX inflows came from a single address and in a single transaction. This deposit came from an old wallet that accumulated 61,216 ETH during the Ethereum Initial Coin Offering (ICO).\n\nThis pre-mine wallet had been dormant for eight years, with its constituent ETH worth more than $116 million untouched. On Wednesday, July 19, this address became activated, and its stash of Ether tokens was abruptly moved to another address associated with the Kraken exchange.\n\nData from Whale Alert shows that a significant amount of Ether tokens has been transferred to crypto exchanges by several whales over the past week. Notably, more than 200,000 Ether tokens have been transferred to Coinbase in separate transactions within this period.\n\nIndeed, the movement of massive amounts of ETH to centralized exchanges can signal impending selling pressure, which can drive the asset‚Äôs price down. However, not all large transfers to an exchange precipitate a downward price movement, as the whales might not intend to sell immediately or all at once.\n\nTotal ETH Staked Reaches All-Time High\n\nThe Ethereum network has been experiencing a steady increase in the total amount of ETH staked on the blockchain. According to data from IntoTheBlock, this figure has reached $52.3 billion, representing its highest value ever.\n\nThe data analytics company also noted that with an increasing amount of staked ETH, the Ethereum blockchain is bound to become even more secure, as there will be a corresponding decrease in the risk of the network being taken over by a single entity.\n\nIt is worth noting that this surge in staking activity can be linked to the successful launch of the Shapella upgrade. The Shapella upgrade offered a new dimension to ETH staking, as investors can now lock and unlock their assets at will.\n\nThis increased flexibility eliminated a substantial portion of risk that has been attributed to ETH staking in the past.\n\nETHUSD trading at $1,886.82 | Source: ETHUSD daily chart from TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Getty, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain, news, and reflection analyst reports, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing uncertainty and volatility. The on-chain data shows fluctuations in various metrics, indicating a lack of clear direction. However, the switch in MACD signal from sell to buy suggests a potential reversal in the market trend. The news analyst report highlights positive developments such as a long-dormant participant transferring a significant amount of ETH and planned upgrades for Ethereum, which could drive further adoption and value appreciation.

In reflection, a moderately conservative approach focusing on long-term profitability and risk management has been effective in navigating the volatile ETH market. It is important to monitor on-chain metrics, news developments, and key trends such as upcoming upgrades and regulatory developments to make informed trading decisions.

Considering the mixed signals in the market and the need for a cautious approach, it is advisable to adopt a slightly conservative trading stance. Emphasizing long-term strategies over short-term gains will help navigate uncertainties and capitalize on potential growth in the cryptocurrency market.

Based on the synthesized reports, I would take a trading action with a confidence level of 0.5. This reflects a neutral stance, balancing the potential for market growth with the need to manage risks effectively in the current uncertain environment.

After reviewing the on-chain, news, and reflection analyst reports, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing a mixed trend with some positive indicators. The on-chain data suggests a potential bullish trend with an increase in successful transactions and unique addresses, along with a switch in the MACD signal from sell to buy.

Taking into consideration the mixed outlook and the need for caution in the current market conditions, it is advisable to adopt a slightly conservative trading approach. While there are positive indicators pointing towards a potential bullish trend, the recent breakdown from the $2,000 level and overall market volatility suggest the importance of managing risks effectively.

Therefore, my trading action would be to buy ETH with a confidence level of 0.5. This decision reflects a balanced approach, considering the potential for a bullish trend but also acknowledging the existing uncertainties and risks in the market. By focusing on long-term profitability and risk management, I aim to maximize overall profit while navigating the volatile ETH market effectively.

The Ethereum (ETH) market is currently experiencing a period of consolidation, with the price trading within a narrow range around $1,870-$1,900. While some analysts predict a potential breakout towards $1,879, others suggest a decline towards $1,800-$1,820 zone. Despite the overall bearish sentiment in the altcoin market, Ethereum stands out as a potential exception due to its bullish price pattern and strong fundamentals, as evidenced by the surge in total ETH staked by validators to a new peak of $52.3 billion. This could indicate resilience and stability in the Ethereum network, potentially leading to a positive market trend for ETH in the near future.

"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the reports from the on-chain analyst, news analyst, and reflection analyst, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing some uncertainty but also showing signs of potential growth. The on-chain data indicates a fluctuating trend with a recent buy signal on the MACD, suggesting a possible shift towards a bullish trend. The news articles highlight significant developments within the Ethereum ecosystem, showcasing innovation and potential for increased adoption and investment. The reflection analyst emphasizes the importance of a moderately conservative approach focusing on long-term profitability and risk management in navigating the volatile market.

Taking into account the synthesized reports, it is advisable to adopt a long-term strategy that balances potential market growth with risk management. While short-term gains may be tempting, a slightly conservative trading approach is warranted given the current market uncertainties. By closely monitoring on-chain data, news developments, and key trends, traders can capitalize on growth opportunities while effectively managing risks.

Considering the overall market trend and the importance of a long-term strategy, I would take a trading action with a confidence level of 0.5. This reflects a neutral stance, indicating a balanced approach to trading ETH with a focus on long-term profitability and risk management.

0.00023917007474993923
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain, news, and reflection analyst reports, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing a mixed trend with some positive indicators. The on-chain data suggests a potential bullish trend with an increase in successful transactions and unique addresses, along with a switch in the MACD signal from sell to buy. The news analyst report highlights both positive developments such as the integration of Polygon ID and challenges like the recent hack on Conic Finance. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a moderately conservative approach focusing on long-term profitability and risk management.

Taking into consideration the mixed outlook and the need for caution in the current market conditions, it is advisable to adopt a slightly conservative trading approach. While there are positive indicators pointing towards a potential bullish trend, the recent breakdown from the $2,000 level and overall market volatility suggest the importance of managing risks effectively.

Therefore, my trading action would be to buy ETH with a confidence level of 0.5. This decision reflects a balanced approach, considering the potential for a bullish trend but also acknowledging the existing uncertainties and risks in the market. By focusing on long-term profitability and risk management, I aim to maximize overall profit while navigating the volatile ETH market effectively.

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a moderately conservative approach focusing on long-term profitability and risk management is recommended. By closely monitoring on-chain metrics, news updates, and upcoming trends, traders can capitalize on growth opportunities while managing risks effectively.

In conclusion, the market trend for ETH appears to be positive in the long term, despite short-term uncertainties. Therefore, a slightly conservative trading stance is advised to navigate potential volatility and capitalize on long-term profitability.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThe quest for dominance between Ethereum (ETH) and its most obvious rival, Cardano (ADA), is taking a whole new shape, with new metrics defining how well each protocol is faring. A sneak peek into both protocols' decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, per data gleaned from DeFiLlama, especially as it relates to the Total Value Locked (TVL) metric, shows that Cardano has a clear lead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer the DeFiLlama data, there is a significant plunge in the total ETH tokens locked within its smart contract; however, the reverse is the case as concerns ADA. For a better perspective, while the total ETH locked in its DeFi protocol as far back as January was pegged at 18.28 million units, the current figure has now plummeted back to 13.33 million units at the time of writing.\n\nCardano, on the other hand, saw the total TVL in its DeFi smart contracts pegged at 198.65 million ADA tokens as of Jan. 1, and today, this ADA lockup has grown to 571.92 million, an indication of consistent growth and embrace of new applications making their way onto the Cardano blockchain.\n\nMore upsides for Cardano\n\nWhile the individual token lockup in DeFi smart contracts is in favor of Cardano, the protocol still lags behind in other significant areas.

This wide disparity in token market capitalization also compliments the overall dollar value of TVL on both protocols.\n\nHowever, amid all these, Cardano has a significant upside that investors can watch out for.

The token is tied to the Worldcoin ecosystem, which users receive upon creation of a privacy-preserving digital identity (World ID).\n\nIn order to create a World ID, users have to have their biometric data captured. This is taken in the form of an iris scan carried out by Worldcoin‚Äôs proprietary, high-tech optic Orb hardware.\n\nThe long term vision of the project would see Orb‚Äôs being built and distributed around the world, allowing users to create their own World ID‚Äôs which can be used for a myriad of use cases.\n\nWorld ID‚Äôs act as a ‚Äúproof of personhood‚Äù that make use of zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-proofs) to protect the underlying data, including biometric, KYC and AML data. WorldCoin will also enable users to ‚Äúreserve‚Äù their respective IDs with a phone number in select countries, with an iris scan required to complete the process and receive a World ID.\n\nThe concept of proof of personhood is not new to the blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem, as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin addressed at length in a thought-provoking essay centered around the use case.\n\nWhat do I think about biometric proof of personhood?https://t.co/yozo1buW24 ‚Äî vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) July 24, 2023\n\nUnpacking Worldcoin\n\nButerin delves into the technicalities of proof of personhood blockchain protocols and the potential benefits and pitfalls of projects that are blazing a trail for the use case.\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder highlighted two key focal points of proof of personhood protocols, namely proving human identity and potential being a means to distribute universal basic income in the future.\n\n‚ÄúWorldcoin is unique in that it relies on highly sophisticated biometrics, scanning each user‚Äôs iris using a piece of specialized hardware called ‚Äúthe Orb‚Äù.‚Äù\n\nAs Buterin explains, WorldCoin Orbs are set to be distributed around the world to allow users to create their respective digital ID. He also highlighted privacy and security concerns around the Orb, design issues regarding its native token and some ethical concerns around whether biometrics ‚Äúare a good ideal at all‚Äù.\n\nThe protocol was originally deployed on Polygon in its beta phase, while the current version runs on the Ethereum mainnet using a scalable batching architecture through layer 2 protocol Optimism. The project has over two millions users enrolled.\n\nSocioeconomic Considerations\n\nAs Buterin continues to explain, Worldcoin aims to produce Orbs to be widely distributed around the world in public spaces that will make digital IDs accessible for anyone to get.\n\nButeriun crediting Worldcoin for committing to decentralizing through a variety of technical aspects , including its architecture as a layer on Ethereum using Optimism‚Äôs scaling SDK. Worldcoin also makes use of privacy centric zero-knowledge proofs, which allow a person to prove ownership of a credential without revealing any of the underlying data.\n\nNevertheless, efforts to ensure decentralization do not detract from criticisms against the protocol which Buterin highlighted, including privacy and security concerns around the Orb, issues with its WLD tokens and ethical issues relating to company decisions.\n\nButerin opined that broader considerations around biometrics and proof of personhood projects are ‚Äúa good idea at all‚Äù:\n\n‚ÄúRisks include unavoidable privacy leaks, further erosion of people‚Äôs ability to navigate the internet anonymously, coercion by authoritarian governments, and the potential impossibility of being secure at the same time as being decentralized.‚Äù\n\nFour Major Risks\n\nButerin‚Äôs essay outlines four major risks that come to mind when considering Worldcoin‚Äôs approach to proof of personhood.\n\nThe first is privacy and whether the registry that contains human iris scans may reveal information:\n\n‚ÄúAt the very least, if someone else scans your iris, they can check it against the database to determine whether or not you have a World ID. Potentially, iris scans might reveal more information.‚Äù\n\nWorld IDs are not easily accessible and may not be reliably accessible around the world unless the hardware is mass produced and easily accessible.\n\nButerin highlights centralization as another risk, considering that the Orb is a hardware device which leaves users with no way of verifying that it was built properly and doesn‚Äôt have ‚Äúbackdoors‚Äù:\n\n‚ÄúHence, even if the software layer is perfect and fully decentralized, the Worldcoin Foundation still has the ability to insert a backdoor into the system, letting it create arbi...'}]

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain, news, and reflection analyst reports, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing a mixed trend with some positive indicators. The on-chain data suggests a potential bullish trend with an increase in successful transactions and unique addresses, along with a switch in the MACD signal from sell to buy. The news analyst report highlights both positive developments such as the integration of Polygon ID and challenges like the recent hack on Conic Finance. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a moderately conservative approach focusing on long-term profitability and risk management.

Taking into consideration the mixed outlook and the need for caution in the current market conditions, it is advisable to adopt a slightly conservative trading approach. While there are positive indicators pointing towards a potential bullish trend, the recent breakdown from the $2,000 level and overall market volatility suggest the importance of managing risks effectively.

Therefore, my trading action would be to buy ETH with a confidence level of 0.5. This decision reflects a balanced approach, considering the potential for a bullish trend but also acknowledging the existing uncertainties and risks in the market. By focusing on long-term profitability and risk management, I aim to maximize overall profit while navigating the volatile ETH market effectively.
ACTION:
0.5
DAILY RETURN:
-0.017534104067875478
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that there is a bullish trend in the ETH market, supported by increasing total transactions, total gas used, total value transferred, unique addresses, and successful transactions. The mixed sentiment in the MACD signal suggests some uncertainty but overall, the market outlook appears positive.

On the other hand, the news analyst report presents a more uncertain picture with mixed sentiment surrounding Ethereum. While there are potential price dips and increased inflows into centralized exchanges to consider, there are also positive indicators such as record network security and anticipation of a significant move in the near future.

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a moderately conservative approach focusing on long-term profitability and risk management is recommended. By closely monitoring on-chain metrics, news updates, and upcoming trends, traders can capitalize on growth opportunities while managing risks effectively.

In conclusion, the market trend for ETH appears to be positive in the long term, despite short-term uncertainties. Therefore, a slightly conservative trading stance is advised to navigate potential volatility and capitalize on long-term profitability.

Based on the synthesized reports and the emphasis on long-term strategies, I would take a trading action with a confidence level of 0.7, indicating a moderately positive outlook for ETH.

Recent entrants include Mantle Network and Consensys‚Äô Linea. Projects like Scroll, Taiko and Honeypot are geared up to enter the game.\n\nThese second-layer protocols are intended to help scale the network by shifting some of the computational processes off Ethereum itself. For users, this means cheaper and faster transactions compared to how they might proceed on the mainnet.\n\nL2 networks have, over time, become economies of their own, collecting billions of dollars worth of digital assets in locked-up deposits along the way.\n\nToday‚Äôs crop of L2 networks chiefly break down into two categories: optimistic rollups and zero-knowledge (ZK) rollups.\n\nOptimistic rollups move user transactions off-chain and then post the data back to Ethereum as ‚Äúcalldata.‚Äù Zero-knowledge rollups, on the other hand, also post their transactions off-chain, but they can validate that it is accurate without revealing the information inside.\n\nOf those building optimistic rollups, prominent players in the game are Arbitrum, Optimism, Base and Mantle. The first two, Arbitrum and Optimism, have amassed nearly $9 billion in total value locked (TVL) between the two protocols.\n\nToday‚Äôs zkSync-centric rollups include Polygon zkEVM, Starknet, Scroll and Linea.\n\nSo optimistic\n\nToday, optimistic rollups are the dominant protocols in the L2 space, according to data from L2BEAT, an information portal for the ecosystem.\n\nArbitrum currently possesses the highest market share, with a TVL of $5.82 billion.\n\nArbitrum developer Offchain Labs is still exploring ways for the protocol to become a stage-3 optimistic rollup, according to co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Harry Kalodner. Under that framework, the rollup would be completely run via smart contracts.\n\n‚ÄúI firmly believe that ZK rollups are much more complicated than optimistic rollups, and the amount of people who actually understand the tech is very tiny,‚Äù Kalodner said.\n\nIn conversation, Kalodner noted that L2 growth often involves a trade-off between permissionless and accessibility of the technology.\n\n‚ÄúWe want to see everybody who wants to have an Arbitrum chain, have an Arbitrum chain, and we‚Äôre balancing that with the competitive realities of the market and being the technical leader,‚Äù Kalodner said.\n\nOptimism is the second-biggest rollup, with a TVL of $2.42 billion. Unlike Arbitrum, Optimism‚Äôs source code is completely open-source, meaning that anyone can use the code to build their own L2.\n\nOf those, Base Protocol, Coinbase‚Äôs decentralized L2 network, has most prominently used the Optimism stack to help build out its so-called superchain vision.\n\nJesse Pollak, head of protocols at Coinbase, believes that on-chain computation will compete directly with the likes of Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud over the next decade. In his view, future apps will be able to run their own infrastructure at a much higher rate.\n\n‚ÄúThe mental model I have for this is you can think of Base and OP mainnet as a shared compute model where you‚Äôre in the same compute environment, then certain apps will scale out of the compute environment‚Ä¶they‚Äôre going to be app chains or L3s,‚Äù he said.\n\nPollak notes that Base is focused on maximizing decentralization and security for as cheap as possible.\n\n‚ÄúThe strategy for us is to create an open source code base, that‚Äôs standardized, configurable, modular, creates decentralized governance and funding infrastructure that attracts developers and makes them feel like they‚Äôre part of something bigger than themselves,‚Äù Pollak said.\n\nPollak added: ‚ÄúThis way we have a bottoms-up groundswell of technology that even if it looks a little bit chaotic in the beginning, and maybe a bit slower.

Validators or miners on the network verify these transactions, making Ethereum a truly decentralized system.\n\nYou initiate a transaction when you send Ether (ETH) from one address to another. This transaction is then broadcast to the Ethereum network, where it is checked and verified.\n\nOnce the transaction gets a confirmation, it is added to a new block and permanently recorded on the blockchain.\n\nHow Ethereum Transactions Work\n\nEthereum transactions function through a series of steps:\n\nAn external account initiates a transaction, such as sending ETH to another user. The transaction request is broadcast to the Ethereum network. Validators on the network execute the transaction and propagate the change to the entire network. A transaction fee is deducted during the validation process. The validated transaction is included in a block.\n\nThere are different types of transactions on the Ethereum network, including regular transactions (from one account to another), contract-execution transactions (interactions with deployed smart contracts), and contract-deployment transactions (deploying the code of a smart contract).\n\nAlso read: Ethereum: Users Holding 1000+ ETH, Drops to 5-Year Low\n\nTracking an Ethereum Transaction: A Step-by-Step Guide\n\nNow that we‚Äôve covered the basics, let‚Äôs dive into the steps on how to check an Ethereum transaction:\n\nStep 1: Acquiring the Transaction Hash\n\nYour journey to tracking your Ethereum transaction starts with obtaining the transaction hash. This unique identifier is given to every transaction on the Ethereum network. You can find this hash in the history or activity section of the crypto wallet or exchange platform you used to conduct the transaction.\n\nStep 2: Using an Ethereum Blockchain Explorer\n\nWith your transaction hash at hand, the next step is to visit an Ethereum blockchain explorer. These are online tools that allow you to view information about transactions, blocks, and addresses on the Ethereum blockchain. Some popular Ethereum blockchain explorers include Etherscan and Etherchain.\n\nStep 3: Input the Transaction Hash\n\nOn the blockchain explorer website, you‚Äôll find a search field. Paste the transaction hash you obtained in Step 1 into this field and initiate the search. The explorer will then retrieve and display the transaction details.\n\nStep 4: Review the Transaction Details\n\nOnce you input the transaction hash, the transaction details will display. This information includes the sender and recipient addresses, the transaction amount, the gas fee paid, and the transaction‚Äôs current status. You can use these details to verify if the transaction was successful.\n\nBesides blockchain explorers, several tools can help you monitor your Ethereum transactions. These tools provide real-time updates and additional features for your transactions.

The news articles indicate a mixed sentiment in the Ethereum (ETH) market. On one hand, Flashbots, a provider of Ethereum software infrastructure, raised $60 million for technology development, signaling continued interest and investment in the Ethereum ecosystem. However, the overall cryptocurrency market, including Ethereum, experienced a decline in prices ahead of the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision, with Bitcoin slipping below $29,200. Additionally, the growth of Ethereum's layer-2 ecosystems, such as optimistic rollups, shows promise for scalability and transaction efficiency. Overall, while short-term market volatility may persist, the long-term potential for Ethereum remains positive with ongoing developments in technology and infrastructure.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that there is a bullish trend in the ETH market, supported by increasing total transactions, total gas used, total value transferred, unique addresses, and successful transactions. The mixed sentiment in the MACD signal suggests some uncertainty but overall, the market outlook appears positive.

On the other hand, the news analyst report presents a more uncertain picture with mixed sentiment surrounding Ethereum. While there are potential price dips and increased inflows into centralized exchanges to consider, there are also positive indicators such as record network security and anticipation of a significant move in the near future.

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a moderately conservative approach focusing on long-term profitability and risk management is recommended. By closely monitoring on-chain metrics, news updates, and upcoming trends, traders can capitalize on growth opportunities while managing risks effectively.

In conclusion, the market trend for ETH appears to be positive in the long term, despite short-term uncertainties. Therefore, a slightly conservative trading stance is advised to navigate potential volatility and capitalize on long-term profitability.

Based on the synthesized reports and the emphasis on long-term strategies, I would take a trading action with a confidence level of 0.7, indicating a moderately positive outlook for ETH.
ACTION:
0.7
DAILY RETURN:
0.01588021184777788
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently displaying strong bullish momentum. The high total transactions, stable gas prices, and positive MACD signal all point towards a continued rise in ETH price. Additionally, the increase in unique addresses and successful transactions further support this positive outlook.

On the other hand, the news analyst report suggests a period of consolidation for ETH, with conflicting predictions on price movements. However, the surge in total ETH staked by validators indicates strength and stability in the Ethereum network, which could potentially lead to a positive market trend for ETH in the near future.

Reflecting on the information provided by both reports, it is evident that a balanced and moderately conservative trading approach is warranted. By focusing on long-term profitability and risk management, traders can navigate the volatile market effectively.

Considering the overall bullish sentiment from the on-chain analyst report and the resilience of the Ethereum network highlighted in the news analyst report, I would conclude that the market trend for ETH is likely to be positive in the long term.

Therefore, my trading action would be to buy ETH with a confidence level of 0.8, indicating a high level of confidence in the positive market trend while still managing risk appropriately.

However, there are concerns raised by news articles regarding potential short-term downtrend if ETH fails to clear the $1,900 resistance level and privacy issues with Worldcoin. The reflection report emphasizes the importance of a balanced and moderately conservative approach to navigate the volatile market.

Considering the mixed sentiment in the market, it is crucial to prioritize long-term profitability and risk management. While short-term uncertainties and conflicting news reports may lead to losses, focusing on on-chain metrics and reliable news sources can help make informed trading decisions. Therefore, a slightly conservative trading stance may be more appropriate to manage risks effectively while capitalizing on potential growth opportunities in the long term.

Based on the synthesized reports, I would take a slightly conservative approach and assign a trading action of 0.5, indicating moderate confidence in the positive market trend for ETH in the long term while being cautious of short-term fluctuations and risks.

Ethereum, which trails only Bitcoin in the crypto world, is known for its uses as a blockchain-powered, open-ended decentralized software platform.\n\nSince the ‚Äúcrypto winter‚Äù of 2022, the network completed a significant update, known as the Shanghai Upgrade, under which it shifted its blockchain validation system from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, and marked one of the most significant developments in the relatively small history of cryptocurrency.\n\nUnder the proof-of-stake system, miners of Ethereum will rely on Ether holders who will act as validators, thus lending more assurance to the system.

However, this could now change, as a historically accurate trend indicator shows.\n\nCrypto traders and analysts constantly seek reliable indicators to navigate the turbulent market. One such indicator gaining attention is the Tom Demark 9 (TD9), which has flashed a buy signal for Ethereum (ETH) on the daily chart. Renowned analyst Joe McCann shared his insights via Twitter, revealing an intriguing success rate of 78% for ETH‚Äôs historical TD9 buy signals.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Buy Signal\n\nJoe McCann‚Äôs tweet brought the spotlight on ETHUSD‚Äôs TD9 buy signal, which occurred after the asset dropped 8.7% from its recent high. The TD9 indicator, an indicator that also measures whether an asset is overbought or oversold, similar to the RSI, aims to identify potential trend reversals. According to McCann, historical data showcases the TD9 buy signal‚Äôs remarkable accuracy for ETH, with a win rate of nearly 78%.\n\nPossible price targets include the July open at $1,933, the August 2022 bear market rally high at $2,031, and the year-to-date 2021 high at $2,142, according to the analyst.\n\nDigging deeper into the data, McCann highlights the impressive performance of ETH following TD9 buy signals. The statistics reveal that, on average, the asset surged by over 2.6% in the seven days following the signal, with a median return of almost 5%. These figures alone could pique the interest of traders looking for an edge in the crypto market.\n\nTo provide a more nuanced picture, McCann narrowed the data to examine the year 2019, a period he deems analogous to the 2023 crypto market cycle. The results are even more captivating, showing a remarkable win rate of nearly 90% for TD9 buy signals during this period.\n\nHowever, if we trim the data back to starting in 2019 (a year very similar to 2023 in terms of crypto market cycles), ETH has a win rate of nearly 90% with the average return over +7%.\n\nBut, as with any indicator, there are exceptions and occasional inaccuracies. McCann‚Äôs data shows several instances where the TD9 buy signal failed to predict ETH‚Äôs price movement accurately.\n\nNoteworthy is March 13, 2018, when the ETH price slid massively after the buy signal. The ETH price plummeted by 19.3% within seven days and by as much as 34.8% within the next 14 days. The signal was similarly bad on May 8, 2018, after which ETH fell by 22.1% in the following seven days and 26.7% in the following 14 days.\n\nOn the other hand, the TD9 buy signal has predicted some massive rallies. For example, on December 10, 2018, following the signal, ETH initially rose by 3.7% in the first seven days, but then came a fabulous 53.0% rise in 14 days and 64.5% in 30 days. The most recent TD9 buy signal on March 11, 20223 delivered a price increase of 18.8% in the first seven days and 29.9% after 30 days.\n\nIn general, it can be seen that the accuracy of the TD9 indicator decreases over time. While the indicator has a success rate of 78% in the first seven days with an average 7-day forward return of +2.65% and a median return of almost 5%, the success rate falls in the subsequent period of time. After 14 days, the TD9 indicator has a success rate of only 55.5% (mean 3.8%, median 5.7%), after 30 days of 63.0% (mean 6.9%, median 3.8%) since 2018.\n\nFederal Reserve Meeting Looms\n\nWhile the TD9 buy signal paints a positive picture for ETH, the crypto market remains vulnerable to external factors, including the upcoming FOMC meeting today. There is a 98.9% probability that there will be a 25 basis point rate hike. But the big question is whether this will be the last hike in this cycle. McCann writes:\n\nJuly 26th is the latest meeting of the Federal Reserve and Jerome Powell is expected to hike rates another 25 bps.

"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently displaying strong bullish momentum. The high total transactions, stable gas prices, and positive MACD signal all point towards a continued rise in ETH price. Additionally, the increase in unique addresses and successful transactions further support this positive outlook.

On the other hand, the news analyst report suggests a period of consolidation for ETH, with conflicting predictions on price movements. However, the surge in total ETH staked by validators indicates strength and stability in the Ethereum network, which could potentially lead to a positive market trend for ETH in the near future.

Reflecting on the information provided by both reports, it is evident that a balanced and moderately conservative trading approach is warranted. By focusing on long-term profitability and risk management, traders can navigate the volatile market effectively.

Considering the overall bullish sentiment from the on-chain analyst report and the resilience of the Ethereum network highlighted in the news analyst report, I would conclude that the market trend for ETH is likely to be positive in the long term.

Therefore, my trading action would be to buy ETH with a confidence level of 0.8, indicating a high level of confidence in the positive market trend while still managing risk appropriately.

DAILY RETURN:
-0.019811571726044197
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain, news, and reflection analyst reports, it is clear that there is a positive sentiment towards ETH in the market based on the on-chain data showing consistent increase in open price and bullish momentum. However, there are concerns raised by news articles regarding potential short-term downtrend if ETH fails to clear the $1,900 resistance level and privacy issues with Worldcoin. The reflection report emphasizes the importance of a balanced and moderately conservative approach to navigate the volatile market.

Considering the mixed sentiment in the market, it is crucial to prioritize long-term profitability and risk management. While short-term uncertainties and conflicting news reports may lead to losses, focusing on on-chain metrics and reliable news sources can help make informed trading decisions. Therefore, a slightly conservative trading stance may be more appropriate to manage risks effectively while capitalizing on potential growth opportunities in the long term.

Based on the synthesized reports, I would take a slightly conservative approach and assign a trading action of 0.5, indicating moderate confidence in the positive market trend for ETH in the long term while being cautious of short-term fluctuations and risks. This approach aims to maximize overall profit by balancing potential growth opportunities with risk management strategies.

Considering the reflection analyst report, it is evident that a balanced and moderately conservative approach has been effective in navigating the volatile ETH market. By prioritizing long-term profitability, risk management, and monitoring key indicators, successful outcomes have been achieved. Therefore, a slightly conservative trading stance may be more appropriate to manage risks effectively while capitalizing on potential growth opportunities in the long term.

There are now more than 20 separate L-2 networks built atop Ethereum, all aiming to improve scalability and efficiency, reducing the cost per transaction.\n\nThe amount of computational resources, known as ‚Äúgas,‚Äù used on the Ethereum network every month to validate and settle transactions taking place on L-2s also remains elevated this year.\n\nL-2 growth appears to be concentrated around airdrop farming transactions Sam Holman, derivatives analyst at Australian trading firm Zerocap, told Blockworks. Airdrop farming is a process where users perform certain actions to be eligible to receive free tokens.\n\n‚ÄúIf you look into the specific chains the volumes have increased on, you‚Äôll see [zkSync] Era and also Polygon [zkEVM] having an elevated contribution, as well as Optimism.‚Äù\n\nA notable uptick in L-2 volume was also observed following Arbitrum‚Äôs airdrop in March, as airdrop hunters migrated from there to zkSync speculating on the eventual debut of a native token to reward early adopters.\n\nUsers transacting on Optimism are primarily doing so via platforms like Uniswap V3 and Stargate, DappRadar daily volume data shows.\n\nAs it stands, Stargate, a LayerZero bridge and airdrop candidate, has about seven times more active users though only around half of the volume of Uniswap. Holman pointed to users cycling through different addresses, repeating the same transactions, to inflate their chances of getting a higher airdrop allocation.\n\n‚ÄúI would put down the consistent volume through Stargate to farmers trying to be eligible for the LayerZero token,‚Äù Holman said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the cheapest chain to bridge funds on and a lot of the market seems to think the number of transactions will be a primary criterion for a LayerZero airdrop.‚Äù\n\nLayerZero CEO Bryan Pellegrino recently told Blockworks‚Äô 0xResearch podcast that, in his view, airdrop hunting was not a dominant factor, but perhaps accounts for around 54% of the volume.\n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt spend too much time thinking about it ‚Äî ultimately it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs outside of my control,‚Äù Pellegrino said. ‚ÄúRight now, if 98% of the volume was [airdrop farmers] it would still be the most used bridge in the world by a factor of like 4.‚Äù\n\nDon‚Äôt miss the next big story ‚Äì join our free daily newsletter.'}, {'id': 3, 'time': 'Thu, 27 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Top Trader Predicts One Ethereum Rival Will Repeat Parabolic ETH Rallies of Past Cycle - The Daily Hodl', 'content': "A closely followed strategist is predicting that one Ethereum (ETH) rival will repeat the competitor‚Äôs parabolic rally from the last crypto cycle.\n\nPseudonymous analyst The Flow Horse, also known as Cantering Clark, tells his 179,700 Twitter followers that Solana (SOL) is mirroring the price action of ETH before a massive move to the upside.\n\n‚ÄúIn a private group (can‚Äôt dox Excel chart of picks or people), my pick for the best-performing coin of the bounce this year was SOL.

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain, news, and reflection analyst reports, it is clear that there is a positive sentiment towards ETH in the market based on the on-chain data showing consistent increase in open price and bullish momentum. However, there are concerns raised by news articles regarding potential short-term downtrend if ETH fails to clear the $1,900 resistance level and privacy issues with Worldcoin. The reflection report emphasizes the importance of a balanced and moderately conservative approach to navigate the volatile market.

Considering the mixed sentiment in the market, it is crucial to prioritize long-term profitability and risk management. While short-term uncertainties and conflicting news reports may lead to losses, focusing on on-chain metrics and reliable news sources can help make informed trading decisions. Therefore, a slightly conservative trading stance may be more appropriate to manage risks effectively while capitalizing on potential growth opportunities in the long term.

Based on the synthesized reports, I would take a slightly conservative approach and assign a trading action of 0.5, indicating moderate confidence in the positive market trend for ETH in the long term while being cautious of short-term fluctuations and risks. This approach aims to maximize overall profit by balancing potential growth opportunities with risk management strategies.

When the network spends more on security, miners consolidate, MEV opportunities diminish and everyday users pay more in the form of inflation. By contrast, with lower spending under PoS, everyday users pay instead in the form of hidden transaction fees due to MEV.

On the upside, price action has been capped under $2,000, amid a general slump in the trading volume.\n\nFollowing the Ripple ruling in early July, investors focused less on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum, favoring other leading altcoins like XRP, Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), Solana (SOL), and most recently Dogecoin (DOGE).\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe biggest task among Ethereum is holding the price above $1,800 ‚Äì a move likely to prevent possible declines to $1,700 and $1,600.\n\nIf a recovery ensues from the current market value, the token powering the largest smart contracts token might trigger a surge in investor interest, who are still waiting on the sideline for an uptrend confirmation above $2,000.\n\nHere‚Äôs What It Will Take Ethereum to Rally?\n\nEthereum price is in the middle of nurturing a potentially massive breakout that could propel it not only above $2,000 but allow bulls to close the gap to $2,400 for the first time since May 2022.\n\nThe daily chart shows the formation of an inverse head-and-shoulders (H&S) pattern, promising a 19% bullish move to $2,385.\n\nThe inverse H&S pattern shows a downtrend ending and an uptrend starting. It has three lows: the middle one is the lowest (head) and the outer ones are higher (shoulders).\n\nThis pattern is validated when the price breaks above a line joining the highs of the shoulders (neckline), located around $2,000 for Ethereum price.\n\nTraders are always advised to buy when this happens or wait for a pullback to the neckline to be certain that the breakout is sustainable and not a bull trap. Note that the price target is the distance from the head to the neckline (19%) added to the breakout point.\n\nOther indicators must be consulted when trading the H&S, especially the Money Flow Index (MFI), which monitors the inflow and outflow of funds in Ethereum markets. That said, the MFI as presented on the daily chart, has a bullish outlook, which implies that a breakout is in the offing.\n\nEvaluating the Bullish Case in Ethereum Price\n\nAdding credence to the bullish outlook on the daily chart is the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator ‚Äì likely to send a buy signal over the weekend.\n\nTraders seeking fresh exposure to ETH long positions should be on the lookout for bullish crosses in the momentum indicator, marked by the MACD line in blue crossing below the signal line in red.\n\nTo be on the safe side, Ethereum price must break and hold above the immediate hurdle, as highlighted by the 50-day Moving Average (EMA) at $1,870. Profit booking can start at $2,000 but extremely bullish traders may want to hold on for the H&S pattern breakout to $2,385.\n\nRelated Articles'}, {'id': 6, 'time': 'Fri, 28 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'SHIB Devs Begin Testing Shibarium to Ethereum Bridge - Decrypt', 'content': 'Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt‚Äôs Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub.

And the launch of the Shibarium-to-Ethereum testnet bridge appears to giving doge-themed tokens a boost.\n\nSHIB, Dogecoin, and even ShibaSwap (BONE) have seen big gains.\n\nData from CoinGecko shows BONE has rallied by 9% over the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, SHIB, with a market cap of nearly $5 billion, has surged by nearly 6% over the same timeframe‚Äîmaking it the fifth-best performer among the 100 biggest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.\n\nDespite the enthusiasm, bridges have become a common attack vector for cybercriminals. Perhaps the worst example relates to the $622 million hack of the Ronin Network in 2022, an Ethereum sidechain used by play-to-earn game Axie Infinity. North Korean hackers were linked to that exploit, along with several others.\n\nNonetheless, this could help the Shiba Inu ecosystem unlock far greater utility‚Äîand help the project move away from being castigated as a "meme coin" where price rises are driven by speculation and greed rather than anything tangible.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut even if Shibarium takes off, affiliated tokens are unlikely to match the heady days of the last bull market. Both BONE and SHIB remain 90% below all-time highs set in 2021, per CoinGecko.\n\nThere\'s been renewed interest in dog-themed tokens of late, with Dogecoin also performing fairly well at certain points this week.\n\nThat likely has something to do with the never-ending speculation that Elon Musk may make the altcoin an official payment method on X, formerly known as Twitter. The billionaire began pumping the coin on the social network back in 2020, and had an instrumental role in the 14,700% surge that Dogecoin enjoyed in the first four months of 2021.\n\nAfter unsuccessful campaigns to drive DOGE to one dollar and SHIB to one cent, potential use as widespread payment methods could herald the start of a new chapter‚Äîand mean there\'s life in the old dogs yet.'}, {'id': 4, 'time': 'Fri, 28 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum Price Will Skyrocket Due To AI-Driven DAO Revolution: Arthur Hayes - NewsBTC', 'content': 'In a thought-provoking blog post titled ‚ÄúMoai,‚Äù Arthur Hayes, co-founder of the renowned crypto exchange BitMEX, delves into the potential impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on the future of economic organization and the role of Ethereum. Hayes argues that the rise of AI-driven Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) will revolutionize the global economy and propel Ethereum to new heights.\n\nThe Critical Role Of DAOs In The AI Era\n\nHayes contends that the current economic progress and per capita wealth of global civilization can be attributed to the efficient self-organization of human societies. He emphasizes that traditional company structures, empowered and regulated by the state, have been the primary vehicles for economic development. However, he highlights the limitations of these structures when it comes to AI-driven entities.\n\nHe states, ‚ÄúAn AI has no reason to follow any laws. It cannot be coerced by the state, and therefore, exchanges that trade tokens issued by AI-powered DAOs will likely become natural monopolies.‚Äù\n\nHayes lays out a compelling argument for why DAOs, relying on smart contracts executed on public blockchains like Ethereum, are the ideal organizational structure for AI-driven entities. These smart contracts provide transparency, immutability, and cryptographic verification of transactions and agreements. Consequently, DAOs can operate efficiently and securely without the need for third-party intermediaries or costly auditing processes.\n\nHe envisions a future where AI-powered DAOs will raise capital and trade their tokens on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on Ethereum rather than traditional centralized exchanges. This will create truly global capital markets accessible to anyone with an internet connection. Hayes predicts that DEXs will become natural monopolies due to the advantages they offer in terms of trust, security, and ease of use.\n\nThe BitMEX founder presents a hypothetical example of ‚ÄúPoetAI,‚Äù an AI-powered DAO that aims to fundraise and produce original poetry for profit. He envisions how PoetAI could issue its tokens, called ‚ÄúPOET,‚Äù through a smart contract with specific attributes, such as revenue sharing and voting mechanisms. Investors can confidently invest in PoetAI DAO knowing that its financial statements are continuously available on the public blockchain, eliminating the need for traditional auditors.\n\nMoreover, Hayes explains that DAOs can raise capital by issuing debt, enabling economic time travel by borrowing from the future to stimulate present economic activity. The enforceability of contracts in DAOs can be facilitated through smart contracts on public blockchains, ensuring that investors are protected.\n\nHayes‚Äô Bull Case For Ethereum\n\nHayes concludes, ‚ÄúEthereum transactions will grow exponentially as DAOs proliferate. As a result, the price of ETH should skyrocket in anticipation if this AI DAO hypothesis is widely believed.‚Äù\n\nHe also suggests that identifying and investing in Ethereum based governance tokens of DEXs facilitating AI-driven DAO trading will lead to significant profits. Furthermore, Ethereum middleware layers that enable visualization of AI DAO accounts will become essential for the smooth functioning of these capital markets.\n\nWhile these ideas represent bold predictions about the future of AI and the role of Ethereum, Hayes presents a compelling case for the potential disruptive power of AI-driven DAOs. Hayes is one of the great thinkers of crypto space and his thesis a narrative to watch.\n\nAt press time, the Ether (ETH) price was at $1,863, just below the mid-range resistance.\n\nFeatured image from rc.xyz NFT gallery / Unsplash, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

It hides the complex processes of blockchain interaction and could finally make web3 apps easier for users.\n\nBlockchain technology has long promised a decentralized future, but its notoriously complex inner workings have severely hampered widespread mainstream adoption. Now, Ethereum developers are leveraging a feature called ‚Äúaccount abstraction‚Äù to completely simplify and streamline blockchain interactions for everyday users. But how does this new abstraction model actually work under the hood?\n\nYou might also like: What Is Ether (ETH)?\n\nEOAs vs. smart contract wallets\n\nTo understand what account abstraction is, we first need to examine the two primary account types that exist on Ethereum today:\n\nExternally owned accounts (EOAs) consist of public-private key pairs that users must securely manage themselves. The public key is the account address you share, while the private key proves ownership and allows you to sign your transactions.\n\nTo perform any action on the blockchain, users need to install browser extensions like MetaMask, copy long cryptographic addresses, approve every transaction prompt, and manually sign each transaction with their private key. This cumbersome process can frustrate new users. And if you ever lose your private key, you lose access to your account and funds forever with no recovery options.\n\nYou might also like: Vitalik Buterin shares insights on Ethereum‚Äôs account abstraction journey\n\nSmart contracts are advanced programmable accounts where developers can program customized logic, rules, and capabilities right into the contract code itself. For example, a smart contract wallet could enable social recovery features, daily transaction limits, access controls, account freezing, batch sending, and many other capabilities not possible with a basic private key-based account. Smart contracts are accounts controlled by code rather than private keys.\n\nThe core innovation of Ethereum‚Äôs new account abstraction protocol is utilizing smart contract wallets to completely manage users‚Äô account activity and blockchain transactions behind the scenes. This abstracts away many of the complexities of blockchain interaction from the user experience.\n\nHow does account abstraction work?\n\nThe technical design is outlined in an Ethereum Improvement Proposal called EIP-4337:\n\nWhen a user wants to perform any action through a web3 application, they simply submit something called a ‚ÄúUser Operation‚Äù into a pool known as the alt mempool. This User Operation contains instructions like ‚Äúsend 0.05 ETH to Address1‚Ä≥ or ‚Äúpurchase NFT #2456‚Äù without requiring direct blockchain signatures.\n\nValidators on the network called ‚Äúbundlers‚Äù periodically pick up User Operations from the mempool, bundle groups of them together into packaged transactions called ‚ÄúBundle Transactions‚Äù, and submit these bundles to a central global smart contract called the EntryPoint.\n\nThe EntryPoint contract acts as a router, forwarding each User Operation to the relevant smart contract wallet it pertains to. It calls validateUserOp(), which verifies the user‚Äôs signature, pays gas fees, and approves/rejects the operation. Next, execute() runs to perform the operation on-chain.\n\nThis sequence allows users to simply submit User Operations, while their smart contract wallet handles validating, bundling, paying gas, and executing Ethereum transactions behind the scenes. All blockchain complexity is abstracted away from users.\n\nBenefits of Ethereum account abstraction\n\nThe implications are profound in terms of unlocking web3 for the mainstream. Regular users could participate in DeFi, NFTs, and blockchain applications without crypto wallets or understanding public-key cryptography, addresses, gas fees, and signatures.\n\nAccount abstraction also enables user-friendly features not possible otherwise, like social recovery, spending limits, batched transactions, and approvals. This brings smart contract wallets significantly closer to the usability standards people expect from traditional finance.\n\nWhile highly complex under the hood, account abstraction finally provides the simplified user experience necessary for decentralized apps to achieve mass adoption. By abstracting away blockchain complexity, Ethereum‚Äôs new protocol brings web3‚Äôs user-owned vision closer to reality.\n\nWhat are the disadvantages of account abstraction?\n\nStill, this approach has one major drawback. While the smart contracts involved in Ethereum‚Äôs account abstraction implementation have been reviewed extensively, they still introduce more complexity to a critical system compared to a simple private-public key pair-based account.\n\nComplexity results in more potential security vulnerabilities and a greater attack surface. For this reason, it is only recommended to use this kind of account when intending to actually use its exclusive feature and the most reco...'}]

Given the positive indicators and the recommendation for a slightly conservative approach, I would take a trading action with a confidence level of 0.7, indicating a moderately high confidence in the bullish trend but also a cautious approach to risk management.

Simply put, it looks like the "we are still very early" motto of crypto veterans is still valid in late Q3, 2023.\n\nIn past year, 27 million new wallets were activated on Ethereum (ETH)\n\nIn the last 12 months, over 26.69 million wallets were created. As such, every 30 days, over 2 million new Ethereum (ETH) addresses started showing activity on the network. Such calculations were made by Jack Gorman, a data scientist at Variant Fund, a VC team that was among early backers of Uniswap (UNI), Polygon (MATIC), Aptos (APT), Worldcoin (WDC) and Matter Labs.\n\nEthereum Address Stats in Past Year\n\n\n\n-Monthly active addresses ranges from ~4.5M - 7M on Ethereum.\n\n\n\n-In the past year, more than 26.69 million wallets were created, averaging around 2 million new wallets per month.\n\n\n\n-The retention rate of new wallets is relatively modest, with‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/c8DmYhHQUX ‚Äî J.Hackworth (@jphackworth42) July 28, 2023\n\nHowever, only 4.5-7 million of Ethereum (ETH) addresses authorize at least one transaction every month. Over 70% of wallets are dropped after 30 days of activity, analyst says.\n\nThree out of five Ethereum (ETH) addresses on the network only completed one transaction. On the other hand, 400,000 wallets show notable activity as they authorized over 100 transactions in the last 12 months.\n\nThis domination of wallets with low activity (66% of active transacting addresses were only active for one day, while 95.5% were active for less than 10 distinct days within the last year) should likely be attributed to euphoria around retroactive airdrops.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, top "airdrop hunters" managed to have their accounts qualified for 12 NFT and token airdrops.\n\nOnly 1.9 million wallets show sustainable activity\n\nHowever, in order to optimize their strategies, "airdrop hunters" create hundreds of Ethereum (ETH) accounts with minimum activity. Sophisticated software is leveraged by the "abusers" of retroactive airdrops.\n\nDuring the ARB airdrop, the most overhyped campaign of the last year, thousands of accounts were controlled by manipulators; over 2,400 wallets were hacked.\n\nWhen the dust settles, activity on Ethereum (ETH) remains low. The total number of wallets that were active for over 10 days in the last year is around 1.9 million, the report says.'}, {'id': 18, 'time': 'Sat, 29 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Shiba Inu price along with BONE rally as Shibarium-Ethereum bridge testnet kicks off - FXStreet', 'content': 'Share:\n\nShiba Inu price as well as Bone ShibaSwap price shot up by 5% and 8%, respectively, in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe Testnet bridge will allow the transfer of tokens between Ethereum and SHIB-based layer-2 chain Shibarium.\n\nThis bullish move may revive the receding interest from new investors, which has resulted in the network growth declining by 44%.\n\nShiba Inu price made some gains as the week came to an end on the back of its ecosystem development. The SHIB world seems to be changing become more serious with the development of Shibarium, an Ethereum based layer-2 solution. This brought gains to key tokens associated with the project, including BONE.\n\nShiba Inu price rise could attract investors again\n\nShiba Inu price noted a 4.7% increase over the past day but more than the meme coin rose another cryptocurrency within its ecosystem. Bone ShibaSwap, which is more famously known by its ticker BONE, shot up by more than 8% to trade at $1.42.\n\nBONE/USDT 1-day chart\n\nThe rally, interestingly, was limited only to these two cryptocurrencies and was not reflected in the rest of the meme coins. The reason behind this was the recent launch of the Shibarium-Ethereum bridge testnet, which led to a surge in the use of SHIB and BONE. Since the bridge is still in the testnet phase, no significant implications on price were observed.\n\nHowever, the investors‚Äô bullishness was enough to still trigger a rise in the cryptocurrencies despite the transactions being conducted on the bridge holding no real-world value. It does suggest a potential increase in the use case of BONE and SHIB going forward when the bridge mainnet launches. The transfer of assets would consequently boost the Shiba Inu price as well.\n\nBut more than the price, the network needs a recovery of investors, which have been disappearing after the disappointing run of Shiba Inu price posted these last couple of weeks. While the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on BONE suggests that the coin is on the verge of being overbought, SHIB barely managed to close above the December 2022 lows of $0.00000791, trading at $0.00000826.\n\nSHIB/USD 1-day chart\n\nA quicker recovery is necessary to revive the arrival of new users, which has been declining rapidly this past week. The network strength, which measures the rate at which new addresses are formed, dipped by more than 44% in just five days, suggesting investors are pulling back.\n\nShiba Inu network strength\n\nThus their return would help not only boost the uptrend in Shiba Inu price but also prevent any significant drawdown.'}, {'id': 15, 'time': 'Sat, 29 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'This Week in Coins: Weak Week for Bitcoin and Ethereum‚Äîand Worldcoin - Decrypt', 'content': 'Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt‚Äôs Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub.

This allows for more value to be retained between the transacting parties. For example, instead of a centralized institution providing liquidity to markets, ordinary investors become market makers by creating LP (Liquidity Provider) tokens.\n\n\n\nIn financial terms, the decentralization in the crypto market has opened up multiple opportunities to investors in the form of residual income. And anybody can unlock $300 a day passive income opportunities with staking rewards from altcoins. This article dives into the top three picks to begin earning passively today: Chainlink (LINK), DigiToads (TOADS) , and Ethereum (ETH).\n\n\n\nDigiToads (TOADS) Introduces NFT Staking\n\n\n\nDigiToads is one of the best altcoins when it comes to the provision of passive income. And this is all thanks to the self-propagating ecosystem (The Swamp) that does the heavy lifting on the investor‚Äôs behalf.\n\n\n\nThe Swamp opens up a new staking opportunity with its NFT Staking program that turns all 3,500 DigiToads NFTs into revenue-creating assets. These stakers earn consistent payouts funded by the protocol‚Äôs taxation system. This link between taxes and payouts causes the funds received by stakers to increase in tandem with ecosystem activity.\n\n\n\nAnalysts have forecast the floor price of these NFTs rocketing on the secondary market when payouts materialize on August 21st. This means as well as receiving dividend payments in line with ecosystem activity, stakers will also hold an appreciating asset.\n\n\n\nThe taxation system, Toad Tax, which funds the staking payout pool, directs 2% of every transaction to these holders. Additionally, it burns 2% meaning that users receive rewards in $TOADS, a hyper deflationary token.\n\n\n\nThe protocol‚Äôs treasury fund will also periodically top up the NFT Staking payout pool, and the active treasury management strategy employed by DigiToads, known as the Platinum Toads initiative, grants the best on-chain raiders remote control of the treasury.\n\n\n\nIn practical terms, it means stakers will earn rewards from taxes and rewards from trading activity in DeFi, hence analysts‚Äô classification of DigiToads as a pioneering project and one of the best passive income plays of 2023.\n\nChainlink (LINK) Staking & CCIP\n\nChainlink (LINK) has seen a rush of economic activity due to the release of its CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol), which seeks to make an internet of smart contracts. This new tech stack will allow cryptos to travel freely across chains, enable developers to create cross-chain applications, and connect private and public blockchains. The final application of CCIP could see direct on-ramps between TradFi banks and DeFi.\n\n\n\n$LINK staking has caught the eye of many investors. Users can lock up their $LINK and earn staking rewards by providing economic security guarantees for Chainlink‚Äôs (LINK) oracle services. The staking program sees 7% APR rewards for node operators and nearly 5% for ordinary stakers. Analysts‚Äô price predictions estimate $LINK trading between $13.62 and $15.62 in 2024, meaning stakers can currently stack up undervalued Chainlink (LINK) through the staking program.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Eclipses 20% Staked\n\n\n\nEthereum (ETH) has always been one of the best altcoins to buy, and recently the total volume of $ETH staked crossed 20%. Ethereum (ETH) staking has become the de facto risk-free rate within DeFi, with investors earning nearly 4% APR on a blue chip asset.\n\n\n\nThousands of new DeFi projects have launched, integrating liquid staking derivatives, sparking what analysts have called LSDFi Summer. The enabling of Ethereum (ETH) withdrawals acted as an enormous derisking event, and institutional inflows into the $ETH staking have been steadily increasing since.\n\n\n\nPrice forecasts predict a range between $3,051.80 and $3,754.46 for Ethereum (ETH) in 2024, meaning all investors accruing stakers rewards have a great upside on their dividends.\n\nClosing Thoughts: Staking and the Power of Passive Income\n\n\n\nThe top altcoins to hold in the run-up to the bull market and throughout the bear market have always been altcoins with staking rewards. Investors steadily build their stack and enjoy all the upside when the market starts rallying.\n\n\n\nComparing $TOADS, $ETH, and $LINK, although all three provide excellent passive income opportunities, the winner has to be TOADS because of the link between economic activity and staking rewards.

Considering the overall positive market trend and the emphasis on long-term strategies, I would recommend holding onto ETH positions or even increasing holdings.

The news articles suggest a positive outlook for Ethereum (ETH) in the cryptocurrency market. Arthur Hayes predicts a potential 1,556% increase in Ethereum's price due to AI-powered DAOs and increased trading volumes on DEXs. Additionally, the activation of new Ethereum wallets and the launch of the Shibarium-Ethereum bridge testnet indicate growing interest and development within the Ethereum ecosystem. Staking opportunities with altcoins like Chainlink (LINK) and DigiToads (TOADS) also present passive income opportunities for investors.

For those with lower risk tolerance, he recommended allocating only 30% of a portfolio in the example, with the remaining 70% in bonds and perhaps index funds.\n\nNovogratz‚Äôs bullish stance on Bitcoin received a boost from BlackRock's application for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in June.

This represented an 82% drop in monthly sales volume on OpenSea since the February high.\n\nSimilarly, following a record-breaking NFT sales volume of $109.12 million in February, Polygon-based NFTs on OpenSea have received decreased patronage from OpenSea‚Äôs users.

Per data from Dune Analytics, OpenSea ended the 31-day trading period with an NFT sales count of 1.14 million. This has since trended downward.\n\nInterestingly, despite the shortfall in sales volume, the count of Polygon NFTs sold on OpenSea this month has surpassed the total count from June.

This was a 29% jump from the 228,859 total NFTs sold in June.\n\nBlur leaves OpenSea in a daze\n\nBlur continues to dominate OpenSea regarding monthly NFT trading volume, data from DappRadar revealed.

Traders are snapping up obscure tokens like BALD, COIN, and BASED on the network using the decentralized exchange LeetSwap.\n\nLeetSwap has recorded nearly $200 million in trading volume over the past day across 377,000 transactions, according to DEX Screener. Aside from RocketSwap, LeetSwap is the only other decentralized exchange on Base where tokens can trade without reliance on financial intermediaries.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMore than half of LeetSwap‚Äôs daily trading volume was comprised of BALD transactions. The token, possibly a reference to Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong‚Äôs shaved head, has surged close to 3,100% over the past day to $0.06718.\n\nBASED had bounced more than 1,000,000% over the same period, and it currently trades hands at $0.02916. The token, despite being around for less than a day, has already notched a market capitalization of $291 million.\n\nOther nascent tokens have notched dizzying gains. Not to be confused with Coinbase‚Äôs stock ticker name on the Nasdaq, COIN eclipsed $0.17 on around $1.1 million in daily trading volume, posting gains of 15,400% over the past 24 hours.\n\nBase‚Äôs public launch is slated for August. And at the moment, there‚Äôs no official way for traders to bridge Ethereum from its mainnet over to Base. However, a so-called Portal Proxy Contract allows developers to do just that.\n\nOn Sunday alone, $54 million of Ethereum had been bridged to Base, according to a Dune Analytics dashboard. The day before, less than $750,000 worth of Ethereum was ported over to Base.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHowever, withdrawing tokens from Base before its public launch is less straightforward than sending Ethereum to a smart contract. Coinbase provides a link to a GitHub repository for developers with details on how to achieve that.\n\nCoinbase built Base in collaboration with Optimism, the Ethereum scaling solution that uses Optimistic Rollups to process transactions in batches and reduce fees.\n\nDecentralized exchanges are a common venue for meme coin mania to take hold. Anyone can create a token, and without strict parameters for which ones get listed, decentralized exchanges are perhaps about as Wild West as crypto gets.\n\nNoted crypto influencer Lady of Crypto said on Twitter that degens were effectively gambling with their hard-earned Ethereum. While she said she‚Äôd bridged over some funds to partake in the mania, she also warned followers to be vigilant against scammers and rug pulls.\n\n‚ÄúI fully expect to lose it all,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf you are going to gamble on BASE, make sure it's money you can afford to lose.‚Äù\n\nYou hear some people made 40,000% or whatever buying $BALD.

The news articles provide a mixed outlook for the ETH cryptocurrency market. On one hand, there is positive sentiment with influential figures like Mike Novogratz recommending investments in Ethereum alongside other assets like Bitcoin. Additionally, the popularity of Ethereum-based NFT collections such as Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks indicates continued interest and activity in the Ethereum ecosystem. However, the decline in sales volume of Ethereum and Polygon-based NFTs on OpenSea may suggest a temporary slowdown in NFT trading activity.

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that there is a positive market sentiment for ETH, supported by the consistent increase in open price and bullish MACD signal. The news analyst report further reinforces this sentiment by highlighting various factors such as the potential price increase, growing interest in the Ethereum ecosystem, and passive income opportunities with staking altcoins. Additionally, the reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a slightly conservative trading approach to manage risks effectively and prioritize long-term profitability.

Taking all these factors into consideration, it is evident that the overall market trend for ETH is bullish in the long term. The positive on-chain data, significant developments in the Ethereum ecosystem, and the recommendation for a slightly conservative trading stance all point towards potential growth opportunities over time.

Considering the positive market trend and the importance of long-term strategies, I would take a strategic approach and enter a long position with a confidence level of 0.8.

In reviewing my recent trading performance, it is evident that a combination of on-chain data, news analysis, and reflection reports has been crucial in making informed trading decisions. The successful outcomes were largely driven by a positive market sentiment for ETH, supported by bullish indicators such as the open price increase and MACD signals.

The news articles suggest a mixed sentiment for Ethereum (ETH) in the cryptocurrency market. The proposal to migrate Celo to Ethereum Layer 2 could potentially boost Ethereum's ecosystem. However, the price analysis indicates a consolidation phase with a potential downside towards $1800 if key support levels are breached.

Although it‚Äôs still significantly away from the top group‚Äîoccupied by tech stocks and precious metals such as silver and gold‚Äîits stature remains among the world‚Äôs leading assets.\n\nThese advancements highlight the growing impact of cryptocurrencies on the global financial stage.

Meanwhile, Plutus is the platform‚Äôs smart contract language, which powers decentralized applications (DApps). These elements are designed to ensure secure and cost-efficient transactions, which is key to the overall utility and adoption of a blockchain network.\n\nThe lower transaction cost is a major point of contention between Cardano and Ethereum, the latter of which has faced criticism for its high transaction fees, particularly during periods of network congestion. Cardano, which is known as the "Japanese Ethereum," is aiming to offer a more accessible, affordable, and permissionless blockchain.\n\nHoskinson\'s comments align with his previous criticisms of Ethereum, where he notably challenged the staking mechanism of the blockchain he once helped to create.\n\nHe has been known to contrast the approaches of the two platforms, suggesting that Cardano\'s proof-of-stake protocol is designed more effectively, contributing to its superiority over Ethereum.\n\nIn a series of critical remarks, Hoskinson has also described Ethereum as "a dumpster fire" and suggested that it could become obsolete.'}, {'id': 6, 'time': 'Tue, 01 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum ETF Race Gains Steam, Six Asset Managers Filed With SEC - U.Today', 'content': 'Advertisement\n\nEric Balchunas, Bloomberg\'s senior analyst for exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and his colleague James Seyffart summarized all approval requests for Ethereum (ETH) futures ETFs that are under review by the U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission.\n\nVanEcks, ProShares, Grayscale, who else?

The auction will begin at 11 am ET today, and interested participants will have 48 hours before Thursday at 11 am ET to place their bids.\n\n‚ÄúThe long-term vision is we have a repo token maturing every week, every month, going out to one year.

Taking all these factors into consideration, it is evident that the overall market trend for ETH is bullish in the long term. The positive on-chain data, significant developments in the Ethereum ecosystem, and the recommendation for a slightly conservative trading stance all point towards potential growth opportunities over time.

Considering the positive market trend and the importance of long-term strategies, I would take a strategic approach and enter a long position with a confidence level of 0.8. This decision reflects my confidence in the market trend and my strategic decision to manage risks appropriately while aiming for long-term profitability.
ACTION:

DAILY RETURN:

After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing positive momentum with increasing open prices, total transactions, and successful transactions. The MACD signal also indicates a bullish trend, suggesting further upward movement in the near future. 

On the other hand, the news analyst report provides a mixed outlook, with positive sentiment from influential figures and continued interest in Ethereum-based NFT collections. However, there are concerns about a temporary slowdown in NFT trading activity, which could impact market dynamics.

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a moderately conservative trading approach is warranted to capitalize on potential growth opportunities while managing risks effectively. Long-term profitability and risk management should be prioritized over short-term gains.

Considering the overall market trend and the need for a cautious approach, I would recommend a trading action of 0.5, indicating moderate confidence in the bullish trend but also a conservative stance to mitigate potential risks. This approach aligns with the need to balance profit potential with risk management in the current market environment.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is clear that while there is a positive market trend indicated by on-chain data, the mixed sentiment in the news analysis suggests potential short-term uncertainties. Therefore, a long-term strategy focusing on the overall bullish trend of ETH and a moderately conservative trading approach would be advisable to balance profit potential with risk management.

Given the current market conditions and the need for a cautious stance, I would take a slightly conservative approach and assign a trading action of 0.5, indicating moderate confidence in the bullish market trend for ETH while also considering the short-term uncertainties highlighted in the news analysis. This strategic decision aims to maximize overall profit by balancing potential gains with risk management in the cryptocurrency market.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.\n\nLatest Prices\n\nTop Stories\n\nAs many as six asset managers have filed applications with the U.S. Securities and Exchange (SEC) for ether (ETH) futures-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs). First off the block on July 28 was the Volatility Shares Ether Strategy ETF. That filing was quickly followed by five other applications: the Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF, VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF, Roundhill Ether Strategy ETF, ProShares Short Ether Strategy ETF, and Grayscale Ethereum Futures ETF all were submitted to the SEC by August 1. Grayscale currently operates the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) with just more than $3 billion in assets under management. It‚Äôs suffered from a long period of trading at a substantial discount to net asset value ‚Äì 41.5% as of yesterday.\n\nMicroStrategy (MSTR), the software developer that‚Äôs amassed a giant bitcoin stash in recent years, filed to raise up to $750 million in share sales, with plans to use the proceeds to in part buy more bitcoin. The news came just after the company announced its second quarter results late Tuesday afternoon. Including some small bitcoin purchases made last month, MicroStrategy‚Äôs holdings as of July 31 amounted to 152,800 tokens worth about $4.5 billion at current prices. The news seemingly gave a lift to bitcoin, which quickly rose about 3% and briefly breached $30,000. The price has since pulled back to the current $29,500.\n\nBinance counts China as its largest market, followed by South Korea, Turkey, Vietnam, and the British Virgin Islands, according to documents reviewed by the Wall Street Journal. The Journal reports that despite the ban on crypto within China, teams from Binance regularly collaborate with Chinese law enforcement to detect potential criminal activity. It also has 900,000 active users in-country, according to the report. A spokesperson for the exchange did not immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for comment. Data from the Journal shows that China is a $80.6 billion futures market and a $9.4 billion spot market for Binance.

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
The recent surge in applications for Ethereum (ETH) futures-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) indicates a growing interest in ETH investment vehicles among asset managers. With six applications filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) within a short period, including from well-known firms like Bitwise and VanEck, there is a clear push towards offering ETH ETFs to investors. This increased interest in ETH ETFs could potentially drive up demand for Ethereum and contribute to a positive market trend for ETH in the near future. Additionally, the news of MicroStrategy's plans to raise funds for more bitcoin purchases and Binance's active presence in China's crypto market could also impact the overall sentiment towards cryptocurrencies, potentially leading to increased trading activity and price movements in the crypto market.

"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing positive momentum with increasing open prices, total transactions, and successful transactions. The MACD signal also indicates a bullish trend, suggesting further upward movement in the near future. 

On the other hand, the news analyst report provides a mixed outlook, with positive sentiment from influential figures and continued interest in Ethereum-based NFT collections. However, there are concerns about a temporary slowdown in NFT trading activity, which could impact market dynamics.

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a moderately conservative trading approach is warranted to capitalize on potential growth opportunities while managing risks effectively. Long-term profitability and risk management should be prioritized over short-term gains.

Considering the overall market trend and the need for a cautious approach, I would recommend a trading action of 0.5, indicating moderate confidence in the bullish trend but also a conservative stance to mitigate potential risks. This approach aligns with the need to balance profit potential with risk management in the current market environment.

REASONING:
Based on the given reports, the on-chain analyst report indicates a bullish market trend for ETH with increasing open prices, total transactions, and a positive MACD signal. The news analyst report, however, presents a mixed sentiment with potential downside risks due to regulatory issues and market uncertainties. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of combining on-chain data with news analysis and a moderately conservative trading approach to manage risks effectively.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is clear that while there is a positive market trend indicated by on-chain data, the mixed sentiment in the news analysis suggests potential short-term uncertainties. Therefore, a long-term strategy focusing on the overall bullish trend of ETH and a moderately conservative trading approach would be advisable to balance profit potential with risk management.

Given the current market conditions and the need for a cautious stance, I would take a slightly conservative approach and assign a trading action of 0.5, indicating moderate confidence in the bullish market trend for ETH while also considering the short-term uncertainties highlighted in the news analysis. This strategic decision aims to maximize overall profit by balancing potential gains with risk management in the cryptocurrency market.
ACTION:

The emphasis on long-term profitability and risk management has led to successful outcomes, while a slightly conservative stance has helped mitigate potential short-term uncertainties.

He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nThe biggest altcoin, Ethereum, displayed a range-bound price action between $1849 and $1887 for almost a week. However, the recent 1.79% fall in Ethereum prices forms a bearish candle breaking the bottom support to exceed the $1849 mark.\n\nCurrently, the Ethereum price trades at $1833 below the 50-day EMA, with an intraday fall of 0.28%. The bearish range breakout intensifies the dark cloud over Ethereum prices, projecting a potential drop in market value to $1800.\n\nTrading View\n\nWith a closing price of $1820, Ethereum was at its lowest closing level in 36 days. This brings the biggest altcoin closer to a long-term support trendline forming since December 2022. The ascending support trendline has helped ETH prices bounce back five times since December 2022.\n\nThe RSI indicator projects a high possibility of a bullish divergence forming at the coming retracement to the trendline. Meanwhile, the 200-day EMA follows a sideways track and stays close to $1800, ready to provide a cushion.\n\nIn case of a bullish reversal, the Ethereum prices can reclaim the 50-day EMA and challenge the $2000 resistance level before reaching the $2150 mark.\n\nHowever, a prolonged downtrend can challenge the bullish dominance of the $1800 mark.'}, {'id': 6, 'time': 'Thu, 03 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'World Mobile launches Ethereum and BNB Chain bridges, strengthening multichain strategy - CryptoSlate', 'content': 'World Mobile (WMT), a global mobile network based on blockchain, has launched dedicated cross-chain bridges for Ethereum (ETH) and BNB Chain networks.\n\nAccording to an Aug. 3 statement, the newly launched cross-chain bridges align with World Mobile‚Äôs multichain strategy of exposing the crypto community to its growing ecosystem, as the bridges would allow users to seamlessly move their WMT tokens between Cardano (ADA) and the other blockchain networks.\n\nSpeed and scalability\n\nWorld Mobile underscored the importance of the scalability and speed offered by both networks, which were key factors in their inclusion.\n\nBy incorporating these networks into its operations, World Mobile aims to realize its vision of connecting global communities and fostering a more inclusive mobile ecosystem.\n\nZachary Vann, the Head of Development at World Mobile Token, further highlighted the dominance and influence of the two blockchain networks within the crypto space. Vann added:\n\n‚ÄúThis is a significant step forward for our multichain strategy, as it will enable our token to access the rich and diverse ecosystems on both chains.‚Äù\n\nAdditionally, the Ethereum and BNB Chain cross-chain bridges will offer users of the two networks a chance to join the emerging WMT ecosystem. BNB Chain and Ethereum are two of the most used smart contract networks, with both networks having more than 200 million unique addresses, respectively.\n\nWMT eyes liquidity\n\nIn addition to its primary objective, the initiative is set to bolster WMT liquidity. Compared to its native Cardano network, Ethereum and BNB Chain currently demonstrate higher levels of liquidity.\n\nNotably, the World Mobile sidechain AyA will see seamless integration with these two prominent networks, further enhancing its potential and accessibility.\n\nWith the creation of the new bridges, WMT now has three cross-chain bridges connecting it to other networks. The third bridge connects World Mobile to Conflux (CFX) blockchain.\n\nDespite a slight drop of 0.93% in the last 24 hours, WMT‚Äôs price holds steady at $0.11489, as per the data from CryptoSlate.\n\nMentioned in this article'}, {'id': 8, 'time': 'Thu, 03 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Key On-Chain Metric Points to Stagnation, Will Ethereum Ever Break $2,000? - NewsBTC', 'content': 'According to Etherscan data, the number of active ERC-20 addresses has not changed much in 2023. It has stayed between 200,000 and 300,000 while Ethereum prices stagnate below July 2023 highs. As of August 2, there were about 275,000 active ERC-20 addresses, up from 156,000 on June 18. Although activity has been low overall, there was a significant increase on June 11, with over 446,000 active ERC-20 addresses.\n\nEthereum‚Äôs price trajectory has been tumultuous in tandem with this activity pattern, looking at the charts. For instance, Ethereum bulls have failed to breach the $2,100 liquidation level posted in the latter stages of H1 2023.\n\nEthereum Prices Volatile, Few Coins Burned\n\nAt the moment, ETH prices hover around the $1,800 range, teetering precariously and likely to drop, looking at candlestick arrangements in the daily chart. Although Ethereum has been bullish in the past two months, bulls have been tamed, and a drop below the $1,800 level may signal a shift from bullish to bearish in the medium term.\n\nWith ETH under pressure, the number of active ERC-20 addresses remains constant and relatively lower than the 2021 peaks. This means there is less demand for ETH, which is used to pay transaction fees. As a result, gas fees are lower because there is less competition for block space. Typically, this would encourage more people to participate and even deploy complex contracts in decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nWith EIP-1559 in the equation, low activity means fewer coins are taken out of circulation. Despite low network activity, the protocol continues to issue 2 ETH after each validated block, watering down deflationary effects enforced by EIP-1559.\n\nDeFi Activities Falling\n\nFalling activity could be attributed to the waning interest in decentralized finance (DeFi) activities over recent months. As of August 2, the total value locked (TVL) remains below $50 billion, with a significant portion of assets tied in Ethereum. DeFi projects like LidoDAO, Curve, and Uniswap facilitate the trading of ERC-20 tokens.\n\nFurthermore, on-chain data highlights USDT as the most actively transacted token. Given its position as the third-largest coin by market cap, with substantial circulation in Ethereum and Tron networks, such a trend is expected.\n\nLooking back at ERC-20 transactions from June and July, it is evident that transfers stayed constant despite temporary price increases. Ethereum prices rose from $1,630 to $2,000 between mid-June and mid-July 2023, but ETH is now lower.\n\nOn-chain ERC-20 activity has remained stable despite price volatility. It‚Äôs unclear whether there will be a change in activity as prices continue to drop. However, lower prices may force token holders to wait and see, leading to less activity.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

The Ethereum market is currently facing a bearish trend as the price struggles to stay above $1800, with a potential drop to $1800 projected. The recent launch of cross-chain bridges for Ethereum by World Mobile aims to strengthen its ecosystem and increase liquidity. Additionally, the surge in applications for Ethereum ETFs suggests a growing interest from asset managers, indicating a potential shift in the SEC's stance towards digital assets. However, the stagnation in on-chain activity and DeFi participation, coupled with the volatility in Ethereum prices, may hinder a significant bullish breakout in the short term.

REASONING:
Based on the given reports, the on-chain analyst report indicates a bullish market trend for ETH with increasing open prices, total transactions, and a positive MACD signal. The news analyst report, however, presents a mixed sentiment with potential downside risks due to regulatory issues and market uncertainties. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of combining on-chain data with news analysis and a moderately conservative trading approach to manage risks effectively.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is clear that while there is a positive market trend indicated by on-chain data, the mixed sentiment in the news analysis suggests potential short-term uncertainties. Therefore, a long-term strategy focusing on the overall bullish trend of ETH and a moderately conservative trading approach would be advisable to balance profit potential with risk management.

*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
After reviewing the three analyst reports, it is evident that there are differing perspectives on the current market trend for ETH. The on-chain analyst report highlights a bullish market trend, supported by increasing open prices, high transaction activity, and a positive MACD signal. In contrast, the news analyst report presents a more cautious outlook, citing a bearish trend in the short term due to price struggles and potential price drops, despite positive developments such as cross-chain bridges and growing interest in Ethereum ETFs. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a balanced and moderately conservative trading approach to manage risks effectively in the volatile cryptocurrency market.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is crucial to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains in order to maximize profitability and manage risks. While the on-chain data suggests a bullish market trend, the caution expressed in the news analyst report regarding short-term price fluctuations and on-chain activity stagnation should not be overlooked. Therefore, a strategic decision that balances these perspectives and considers potential downside risks is essential for long-term success in ETH trading.

Based on the overall analysis, I would recommend a moderately conservative trading action with a confidence level of 0.5. This decision reflects a balanced approach that acknowledges the bullish market trend indicated by on-chain data while also considering the potential short-term challenges highlighted in the news analyst report. By maintaining a cautious stance and prioritizing risk management, traders can position themselves to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities in the ETH market while navigating potential market uncertainties effectively.

REASONING:
After reviewing the three analyst reports, it is evident that there are differing perspectives on the current market trend for ETH. The on-chain analyst report highlights a bullish market trend, supported by increasing open prices, high transaction activity, and a positive MACD signal. In contrast, the news analyst report presents a more cautious outlook, citing a bearish trend in the short term due to price struggles and potential price drops, despite positive developments such as cross-chain bridges and growing interest in Ethereum ETFs. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a balanced and moderately conservative trading approach to manage risks effectively in the volatile cryptocurrency market.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is crucial to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains in order to maximize profitability and manage risks. While the on-chain data suggests a bullish market trend, the caution expressed in the news analyst report regarding short-term price fluctuations and on-chain activity stagnation should not be overlooked. Therefore, a strategic decision that balances these perspectives and considers potential downside risks is essential for long-term success in ETH trading.

Based on the overall analysis, I would recommend a moderately conservative trading action with a confidence level of 0.5. This decision reflects a balanced approach that acknowledges the bullish market trend indicated by on-chain data while also considering the potential short-term challenges highlighted in the news analyst report. By maintaining a cautious stance and prioritizing risk management, traders can position themselves to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities in the ETH market while navigating potential market uncertainties effectively.

Almost 90% of its aggregated total value locked (TVL) is controlled by three networks. Here\'s how Arbitrum (ARB) keeps its supremacy in this field.\n\nArbitrum succeeds since it remains "credibly neutral," Patrick McCorry says\n\nCryptocurrency researcher Patrick McCorry, former assistant professor at King\'s College London, is sure that "credible neutrality" is one of the reasons behind Arbitrum (ARB), Ethereum-based network\'s success. Its team has never launched "official" decentralized applications on Arbitrum (ARB), leaving space for open competition.\n\nIn my opinion as an observer, one of the reasons why Arbitrum has been successful to date is that the ecosystem did not pick a favourite and remained credibly neutral.\n\n\n\nWithout favourites, it allows anyone to feel like they can deploy on the chain and compete as an equal. https://t.co/fcM5IMVQ55 ‚Äî Patrick McCorry (üíô,üß°) (@stonecoldpat0) August 5, 2023\n\nWith no "favorite" applications officially supported by Arbitrum DAO and Offchain Labs, any team can come to the blockchain and start deploying "like an equal."\n\nMcCorry\'s position echoes that of the Arbitrum (ARB) community head, who slammed the L1s and L2s that created their own applications on corresponding blockchain networks:\n\nThe worst thing a chain team can do is start creating their own native dApps or products on top of it. You just end up being in direct competition with teams building on your chain within that vertical\n\nArbitrum (ARB) has never endorsed any applications as its "native": All crucial protocols using it as a technical basis are created by third-party teams.\n\nAs covered by U.Today, there is strong evidence that Arbitrum\'s (ARB) growth is fueled by real usage in DeFi: Airdrop hunters are only responsible for 5-6% of its transactions.\n\nArbitrum vs Optimism rivalry gains traction\n\nBy press time, Arbitrum (ARB) remains the largest Ethereum-based network by TVL: It has accumulated $5.93 billion in liquidity across all of its verified protocols. This is equal to 56.16% of the whole Ethereum L2s ecosystem. Its closest competitor Optimism (OP) is responsible for $2.95 billion, or 27.8% of liquidity.\n\nHowever, in the past week, Optimism (OP) has surpassed its rival in a number of crucial metrics, starting from the number of daily on-chain transactions.\n\nIt was also closer to surpassing Arbitrum (ARB) in the net number of daily active addresses. However, both metrics might only be rallying due to the hype around Worldcoin (WDC), a controversial eye-scanning project by OpenAI\'s Sam Altman.\n\nThat is why analysts are sure that nothing poses a threat to Arbitrum\'s (ARB) dominance in the L2s segment it has kept for a couple of months.'}, {'id': 6, 'time': 'Sat, 05 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'How Cardano keeps dominating Ethereum despite price decline - AMBCrypto News', 'content': 'Cardano‚Äôs development activity was substantially higher compared to Ethereum.\n\nADA‚Äôs price dropped by 6% last week, but there was a possibility of a trend reversal.\n\nCardano [ADA] has outperformed the king of altcoins, Ethereum [ETH], by a huge margin in terms of development activity.

Its development activity contributor count also remained high.\n\nA major reason for this uptrend can be attributed to the recent Mithril mainnet launch, which aimed to reduce the time required for nodes to sync with the blockchain.\n\nAfter the mainnet update was pushed, Cardano‚Äôs multiple teams continued to work on other projects, which were highlighted in the blockchain‚Äôs latest edition of its weekly development report.\n\nAs per the report, Mithril mainnet has been consistently producing new certificates and snapshots.

Ever since, other asset management companies, including ProShares, Roundhill Financial, Bitwise, Van Eck, and Grayscale Investment, have filled submissions, with some bringing multiple applications.\n\nThe most recent application, filed on August 3 by ProShares, proposes an equal-weight Bitcoin and Ether ETF to measure the performance of holding long positions in the nearest maturing monthly Ether and Bitcoin contracts.\n\nAccording to renowned Financial Expert at Bloomberg Intelligence, James Seyffart, ProShare filed four separate applications with the SEC. Bitwise also submitted three applications, while Grayscale Investments filed two applications.\n\nHowever, despite the growing optimism, it remains to be seen if the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve these filings. The SEC has never approved an ETF that tracks Ether Futures contracts, unlike Bitcoin Futures ETFs that have been around since October 2021.\n\nMany market experts have argued that these applications are a mere gamble by these asset management companies, who do not want to miss out on being the first Ethereum ETF in the United States.\n\nETH price holds steady above $1,830 amid ETF race | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nThe likelihood of receiving the SEC‚Äôs approval remains slim as the regulatory body has never approved an Ethereum futures ETF filing.

This has further compounded regulatory uncertainty around the network.\n\nIf none of the applications before the SEC get denied, the Ether ETFs will launch 75 days from their respective filing dates. Analysts expect the Volatility Shares ETF to lead the charge on 12th October.\n\nUnderstanding The Difference Between Futures And Spot ETF Products\n\nThe primary difference between futures and spot ETF products lies in the fact that while the former tracks the price of futures contracts, the latter requires the issuers to purchase the underlying assets. Spot ETFs are generally considered more valid since they require the fund manager to purchase and hold underlying assets.\n\nThe current spike in Ether-based applications comes amidst a wave of filings from leading asset management companies, including BlackRock, the world‚Äôs largest asset manager, among others. These companies are looking to offer the first spot in Bitcoin ETF in the US.\n\nInvestors and members of the crypto community remain expectant of the outcome of the SEC‚Äôs consideration of the applications lying before it.

Backed by a strong team of developers, software engineers, and researchers, it constantly upgrades over time. But, have you ever wondered who is deciding and implementing these upgrades?\n\nA decision or a proposal to make a change to the network has to be agreed upon by the entire development community of Ethereum. Only then, they can put it into action. The Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) concept was introduced to make this process smooth. Let us help you understand everything about Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) in this article.\n\nWhat are Ethereum Improvement proposals (EIPs)?\n\nEthereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) are standard potential changes, new features, or processes that improve the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole.\n\nThey were first introduced in October 2015 following the footsteps of the Bitcoin Improvement Protocols (BIPs) process, which itself followed Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs). EIPs have all the information of an upgrade and act as a ‚Äúsource of truth‚Äù to the community.\n\nDecentralization is the core feature of Ethereum and hence anyone can suggest a change to the network. But, you must follow the guidelines included in EIP-1 to suggest a proposal. Till now, most of the EIP authors are application developers or protocol developers. And, EIP editors like Gavin Wood and Vitalik Buterin, review them, correct them, and format issues.\n\nSignificance of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs)\n\nWhether it‚Äôs the transition of Ethereum from a PoW network to a PoS network or the creation of non-fungible tokens, everything started with an EIP. They play a key role in every upgrade happening around the Ethereum network.\n\nSome of the top Ethereum Improvement Proposals that were already implemented are EIP-1559 (fee market change), EIP-20 (ERC-20 token standard), and EIP-721 (ERC-721 standard). The historical ‚ÄúThe Merge‚Äù event was proposed by the EIP-3675. Similar to these, every upgrade happening on the network consists of a set of EIPs.\n\nEIPs allow the network to change, improve, and adapt to the increase in its usage. This makes Ethereum flexible and constantly updates to changes in the industry and meets changing demands of the users. By going through the review process by the whole community, EIPs make sure that these decisions are inclusive and accurate.\n\nTypes of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs)\n\nThere are 3 types of EIPs which we are going to discuss here.\n\nStandards Track EIP\n\nThe Standards Track EIPs change almost all of the Ethereum implementations. These proposals make changes directly to the Ethereum network protocol. They include changes in block or transaction validity rules, changes that affect the interoperability of Ethereum dApps, etc.\n\nStandards Track EIPs have 3 parts of implementation ‚Äì a design document, an implementation, and an update to formal specification. Furthermore, we can categorize these EIPs into Core, Networking, Interface, and ERC proposals.\n\nMeta EIP\n\nUnlike Standards Track EIPs, Meta EIPs do not make direct changes to the Ethereum network protocol. These are more like procedures, guidelines, or changes in the decision-making process. We can also call them Process EIPs and these changes require community consensus as they are more than just recommendations.\n\nInformation EIP\n\nThese EIPs neither make changes to the network protocol nor require community consensus. These proposals suggest general guidelines or information to the Ethereum community. Members of the community and implementers can ignore informational EIPs or follow their advice based on their choice.\n\nHow are EIPs Processed?\n\nSimilar to how a law must pass some stages to be finally implemented, an EIP must also go through some stages. Every EIP must pass through the following steps.\n\nDraft ‚Äì In this phase, the EIP is still in the hands of the author. Once it follows all the guidelines of proposing an EIP like having no errors, proper format, and making technical sense, it can now be submitted to the Ethereum repository on GitHub for review.\n\nIn this phase, the EIP is still in the hands of the author.

Therefore, a strategic decision that balances these perspectives and considers potential downside risks is essential for long-term success in ETH trading.

However, the reasoning behind nd4.eth‚Äôs decision to annihilate such a sizable sum of Ethereum remains veiled in obscurity.\n\nLaurence Day, the innovator behind the Wildcat Protocol, infused an element of humour into the situation, tweeting, ‚ÄúIf you didn‚Äôt arise this morning and express gratitude to nd4.eth for contributing to the ultrasound money narrative, I urge you to engage in profound introspection regarding your objectives.‚Äù\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDelving deeper into the incident, analysts from the on-chain analysis company Lookonchain disclosed additional particulars about the persona behind nd4.eth.\n\n‚ÄúThe guy who transferred 2,500 $ETH($4.58M) to a dead address on July 26th is a whale with 34,287 $GMX($1.84M) and 311,003 $GNS($1.43M).

Last March, an NFT collector called Brandon Riley accidentally sent his CryptoPunk #685, purchased for 77 ETH ($129,437), to a burn address while attempting to wrap it for trading on NFTfi. The irreversible error wiped out a third of Riley‚Äôs net worth. Although unrecoverable, Riley‚Äôs CryptoPunk was ‚Äúresurrected‚Äù as a Bitcoin ordinal on the blockchain.\n\nLast September, cryptocurrency exchange Kucoin accidentally sent a substantial amount of Ethereum (ETH), valued at tens of millions of dollars, to the Ethereum burn address. This unexpected move, spanning over three days and involving more than 3,500 USDT and ETH transactions, left the cryptocurrency community puzzled with the exact motive behind this burn remaining unknown.'}]

This makes the platform somewhat deflationary because the circulating ETH amount reduces as coins get actively burned on the network.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum: These ETH Futures ETFs Are Awaiting Approval\n\nPresently, gas fees generated by ETH transfers and smart contract operations are the main drivers of these burns. Additionally, NFT and DeFi platforms like OpenSea and UniSwap, also play a role. Additionally, the transfer of USDT, an ERC-20 token on the ETH network, also adds to ETH burns.\n\nWill Ethereum prices react to the burns?\n\nSource: Forbes\n\nSo far, ETH‚Äôs prices have not heavily responded to the burns. This could be because of less demand as of now. Burns without demand will do little to push the asset‚Äôs price. However, the project‚Äôs end goal is for the burn rate to outpace the rate of issuing new coins. This would effectively turn Ethereum (ETH) deflationary.\n\nAlso Read: How To Check An Ethereum Transaction?\n\nMoreover, many argue that ETH has become more deflationary than Bitcoin (BTC) after the implementation of the EIP-1559 protocol. This protocol is responsible for burning a fraction of the gas fee from each transaction. However, ETH does not have a fixed cap on its supply, unlike BTC which is capped at 21 million coins. Therefore, ETH‚Äôs burn rate will have to outpace its issuance in order for it to be truly considered a deflationary asset. At press time, Ethereum was trading at $1,833.89, down by 0.2% in the last 24 hours.'}, {'id': 7, 'time': 'Tue, 08 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Lido adoption surges with 10000 new stakers despite Ethereum's price struggles - CryptoSlate", 'content': 'More than 10,000 new stakers joined Lido (LDO) in July, according to the latest report from the liquid staking protocol, indicating its continued adoption and growth despite the current market situation.\n\nIn July, Lido‚Äôs TVL briefly exceeded $15 billion for the first time since May 2022 but fell below the benchmark due to Ethereum‚Äôs (ETH) price struggles.\n\nOver the preceding month, the value of Ether underwent a modest decline of approximately 3% to $1,815 as of press time, according to CryptoSlate‚Äôs data. This price correction emerged as the initial enthusiasm within the crypto market, fueled by a bullish streak in June primarily driven by institutional investors, gradually subsided.\n\nEven though Lido‚Äôs TVL experienced a decline from its impressive $15 billion benchmark, it retains its position as the foremost DeFi protocol. Notably, Lido continues to command a substantial 36% share of the aggregate TVL encompassing all DeFi projects.\n\nPredicts staked Ether to grow beyond 8M\n\nThe DeFi protocol predicted that the total number of staked Ethereum via its platform will surpass eight million in August, as it has consistently experienced large monthly net inflows despite the activation of withdrawals.\n\nDeFillama data shows that this prediction has come to pass with the total value of assets locked on Lido in terms of Ethereum currently at 8.08 million ETH, an all-time high. However, Lido‚Äôs website places the number at around 7.9 million as of press time.\n\nCurve Finance exploit impact Lido\n\nIn the wake of the recent exploit of Curve Finance, several liquidity providers withdrew their assets from the platform‚Äôs stETH-ETH pool.\n\nDespite the fact that this specific pool remained untouched by the exploit, stETH‚Äôs usage in DeFi experienced a decline of 2.88% compared to the previous month of June. Consequently, the overall share held within the liquidity pools also underwent a substantial contraction, plummeting by 53.07%.\n\nOther metrics\n\nLido‚Äôs increasing adoption has also translated into the growing adoption of its staked ETH.

On this digital stage, an alarming manifestation of crime thrives, the titanic scale of which was recently unveiled by insightful researchers.\n\nThe proliferating shadow of cybercrime on Ethereum\n\nThe spectre of cybercrime is spreading in the shadow of the Ethereum network. While bitcoin remains the undisputed behemoth of the cryptosphere, Ethereum stands out for the complexity of its fraudulent activities, according to researchers.\n\nIts ability to host smart contracts offers a wider range of digital crimes. This characteristic transforms Ethereum into a veritable cybercrime empire.\n\nAccording to information extracted from blockchain explorers such as Etherscan, an alarming number of over 5,600 Ethereum addresses have been identified as being linked to cybercrime activities.\n\nWhat‚Äôs more, these findings find a powerful echo in the rigorous analyses carried out by Whale Alert‚Äôs ScamAlert. Together, these data reveal the frightening extent of cybercrime in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThese tagged addresses traced over 1.78 million transactions from unsuspecting victims, totaling a staggering $1.65 billion in stolen funds. This figure is almost 16 times greater than self-reported losses to the FTC, revealing the severe extent to which crypto cybercrime is under-reported by regulators.\n\nThe many faces of cybercrime on Ethereum\n\nOn the throne of Ethereum crime, Ponzi schemes reign supreme. They account for 60% of stolen funds, far surpassing the scale of traditional financial Ponzi schemes. Fraudulent donations follow at 18%, followed by mining (13%) and hacking (5%).\n\nThe pseudonymity offered by blockchain has given Ponzi scams a mask of anonymity. This makes them harder to detect and crack down on.\n\nWhat‚Äôs more, the global reach of cryptocurrencies has widened the scope of these scams. As a result, crypto-Ponzi scams have become a ubiquitous and worrying threat to investors worldwide.\n\nBut the evil doesn‚Äôt stop there. New cybercrimes are emerging, specific to the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Rug pulls‚Äù, for example, lure investors into new projects only to abandon them abruptly, draining all liquidity. Phony token scams create worthless imitations of real coins to fool traders.\n\nRepercussions and the need for a shift in direction\n\nBeyond simple quantification, the researchers analyzed the impact of cybercrime on investor behavior.\n\nIn the short term, victims obtain higher returns by taking greater risks. But over the long term, their risk-adjusted returns significantly underperform those of non-victims.\n\nImproved consumer protection is urgently needed to safeguard mainstream investors as cryptocurrency adoption grows. Regulators must also step up their efforts to curb illicit crypto activity, before it seriously undermines confidence in blockchain technology as a whole.\n\nOnly increased diligence on the part of legislators and investors will enable decentralized finance innovation to continue to flourish. What‚Äôs more, Bitcoin‚Äôs spectacular spike to $150k during its halving could attract an influx of newcomers, unfortunately opening the door to a potential multiplication of scams.

However, the hope remains it could hit the high price level of $5,000 sometime in the future.\n\nAs it happens, Ethereum managed to get close to this mark on November 9, 2021, when it reached its all-time high (ATH) of $4,815.01, climbing by 168.25% from the $1,794.97 where it stood on July 21, 2021, which is close to its price at present and suggests a very real possibility of repeating this success.\n\nWith this in mind, Finbold has analyzed the main factors that could (but do not necessarily have to) lead Ethereum closer to the $5,000 price level and eventually overtake it ‚Äì either by themselves or together with other influences.\n\nMass adoption of Ethereum-based applications\n\nWith Ethereum being the most popular blockchain choice to build a wide range of decentralized applications (dApps) on, such as in the sector of decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and gaming, it could help its cryptocurrency grow further in price, thanks to the growing demand.\n\nFor instance, one of the major companies building on the Ethereum blockchain is PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL), which has recently announced the launch of its own ERC-20 United States dollar-pegged stablecoin PayPal USD (PYUSD), issued by crypto firm Paxos Trust Company, as Finbold reported on August 7.\n\nImproved scalability\n\nWith the launch of the better-performing, more accessible ‚ÄòEthereum 2.0,‚Äô the network has improved its scalability, helping it handle more transactions per second and making it more attractive to users and developers. If this trend continues, it could lead to growing demand for Ethereum and its higher price.\n\nIndeed, the Ethereum development team has been working hard on boosting the network‚Äôs usability, the work that also brought a shift from the proof-of-work (PoW) to the proof-of-stake (PoS) model with an aim to reduce energy waste and transaction times, as well as improve scalability.\n\nInstitutional adoption\n\nOn top of that, more institutional investors recognizing Ethereum‚Äôs potential and buying more ETH could drive the price higher simply by following the rules of supply and demand ‚Äì the more desirable an asset is, the higher its price, and institutions can have the power to contribute in shaping market trends.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum‚Äôs advance could also happen under the influence of the Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and X (formerly Twitter) CEO, Elon Musk, supporting the bold prediction on the future of the crypto market that could see both Ethereum and Bitcoin (BTC) surge massively.\n\nRegulatory environment\n\nAmid increased regulatory pressure, particularly in the US, which has culminated in multiple lawsuits against some of the industry‚Äôs largest representatives, the cryptocurrency market as a whole can feel its effects, which is why positive regulatory developments and favorable regulations for digital assets could help drive their prices, including Ethereum.\n\nOne example of such positive developments is the refusal of the British financial services minister, Andrew Griffith, to agree with the Treasury Committee‚Äôs recommendation to regulate retail trading and investing in unbacked crypto assets as gambling in late July and his support of their treatment as other financial services.\n\nMarket sentiment\n\nFinally, the atmosphere in the wider crypto and macroeconomic landscape can often influence the price of particular assets, including cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, for instance, with positive (or negative) developments and news coverage about the industry.\n\nIndeed, the above factors could contribute to the bullish sentiment, and when people are feeling bullish about digital assets in general, they are more likely to invest in them, and the positive sentiment could affect the price of ETH, which is more likely to increase.\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum was at press time changing hands at the price of $1,828.2, the same as the day before, in addition to losing 0.29% in the last week and declining 2.05% on its monthly chart, as per the latest information retrieved on August 8.\n\nEthereum 7-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nIn conclusion, time will tell if the above factors are truly powerful enough to push the price of Ethereum toward $5,000. But one thing is for certain ‚Äì they could, indeed, contribute to its strengthening and, in time, possibly reaching this coveted price level.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

It is one of the selling points of the world‚Äôs second most-used cryptocurrency. However, PayPal Holdings, Inc.‚Äôs (PYPL) announcment on Monday that it would be introducing its own U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, PayPal USD (PYUSD), could spark some serious debate.\n\nPYUSD is an Ethereum-based stablecoin, which would, after introduction, be pegged to the value of the U.S. dollar. It has been designed for digital payments and the web, and will soon be available for U.S. customers. But even as this is bound to push Ethereum stocks up by establishing its place as the money layer on the Internet, it will also hit the crypto coin‚Äôs core value of decentralizing.\n\nCentralization issues are the most common attack areas within the gamut of decentralized finance or DeFi, one of the crypto world‚Äôs main differentiating features. In 2021 alone, DeFi hacks amounted to no less than $10 billion, revealing patterns of how the transactions are classified and tracked. Now, with around 430 million accounts actively using PayPal, the chances of cluster attacks would go up.\n\nMany smart contract auditors have highlighted that the PYUSD algo contains ‚Äúfreezefunds‚Äù and ‚Äúwipefrozenfunds‚Äù functions, which are textbook examples of centralization attack vectors. Concerns have also been raised about the digital contract that users would sign, and that these contracts resemble censorship-enabled central bank digital currency.\n\nDespite this, Ethereum would get a massive boost once the project goes live. It would finally give Ethereum the mainstream push that it has been seeking all these years in its competition with Bitcoin (BTC). Coupled with the Shanghai Upgrade, under which it shifted its blockchain validation system from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, this might be ETH‚Äôs year.\n\nPowered by these developments and what has largely been hailed as a crypto rebound, the price of Ethereum has soared 53.9% this year as of Aug 8. So, with Ethereum getting this push, it might be prudent to keep a watch on stocks exposed to this open-source blockchain platform, decentralized or not.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccenture plc ACN is a global system integrator that provides consulting, technology and other services, and markets Ethereum-based blockchain solutions to businesses to make it easier to process payments.\n\nAccenture‚Äôs expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 8.2%.

As a result, the Ethereum blockchain has seen the highest growth rate in new addresses in recent years.\n\nThis growth has been particularly high as more people flock to decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), the majority of which are built on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAs of the time of writing, there are now 104,127,318 Ethereum addresses holding at least one wei, the smallest unit of ETH. Just around two years ago in 2021, this metric was around 50 million addresses, showing a 100% jump during this time.\n\nAlthough only a fraction of these wallets are active, the high number of non-zero addresses shows the sheer increase in ETH adoption.

A world where decentralized applications empower individuals, and the potential for innovation knows no bounds. Against a highly equivocal and chaotic macroeconomic landscape, this is the world that the prophets of Ethereum dream of.\n\nBut little do they know this world is like an unrealized dream. Why? Let‚Äôs dig deeper.\n\nReflecting on the Ethereum liquid staking landscape\n\nCentralized liquid staking protocols are at the forefront of the liquid staking revolution on Ethereum, and it shouldn‚Äôt come as a surprise. Why? Because they are highly scalable ‚Äî thanks to the centralized validator set that they have. The biggest liquid staking protocol on Ethereum currently has a limited node operator set of 29 operators. It must then be a no-brainer that they hold a hegemony over the network. Any protocol claiming to be decentralized but running its operations as a business is also able to offer much higher standards of composability. While this composability that is offered to users is a feature, it can be counter-productive as well ‚Äî primarily because of the systemic risks this can cause.\n\nOn the flip side, decentralized protocols do exist, but they are highly unscalable. And thus, they have a fraction of ETH staked in them compared to what is often staked via the centralized ones.\n\nWhile decentralized protocols have attempted to reduce the minimum capital required to run a validator node from 32 to 8 ETH, that is still a sizeable amount for the wider ecosystem. Admittedly, this does open up opportunities for a wide number of stakers to start staking on the network, however, we contend that 8 ETH is still a sizeable amount. This reintroduces the problem of scalability, and thus a significant portion of ETH gets staked through a select group of professional node operators. This leads to the further concentration of staked ETH. The presence of these centralized node operators across different liquid staking protocols undermines the censorship resistance of the underlying network.\n\nThe inflow of ETH post-Shapella is a good indicator of users‚Äô liquid staking preferences. One would hope that a lot of the incoming ETH would go to decentralized liquid staking; however, the figures state otherwise.\n\nMaking Ethereum liquid staking scalable\n\nOne of the biggest challenges for the existing liquid staking protocols today is that they are tuned for either scalability alone or decentralization alone. The ones that are tuned for scalability alone are not decentralized, and the ones that are tuned for decentralization are not scalable. There are several examples of this ‚Äî from protocols having a concentrated node operator set to those having high minimum capital requirements to run validator nodes for Ethereum.\n\nWhile there have been attempts by these protocols to move towards either making their architectures scalable or decentralized, making that is quite difficult given the huge amounts of ETH that are already staked via them. Moreover, these protocol-level changes require a lot of internal deliberations (at-least for decentralized protocols) before they are rolled out.\n\nMoreover, a core objective of any business is to make sure that they hold the hegemony over the industry to persistently retain that. This is reflected by the feigned attempts at a willingness to decentralize ‚Äî but then having them falling on their head. Perhaps, there is no reason why this would happen. A centralized liquid staking protocol often operates as a business whose core objective is to compromise decentralization to achieve profitability. While I do not condemn the latter, I do feel that it comes ‚Äî almost always ‚Äî at the cost of decentralization.\n\nWhat Ethereum needs\n\nEthereum prophets often call for the need to diversify staking across a multitude of protocols. And perhaps, it wouldn‚Äôt be remiss to credit those protocols that have emerged that are attempting to realize that vision. However, I must provide a caveat that any emerging protocols need strategic and critical analysis. No one would want shabby architecture being polished and presented as a resilient solution and risking the stability of Ethereum. I believe that there are two things that need immediate attention to drive growth to Ethereum liquid staking:\n\nReducing the minimum capital requirements to run a validator node: This is perhaps easier stated than executed. Reducing the minimum capital requirements incentivizes a wider spectrum of users to participate in network validation.\n\nThis is perhaps easier stated than executed. Reducing the minimum capital requirements incentivizes a wider spectrum of users to participate in network validation. Building censorship resistance: This is perhaps common knowledge, but it often gets overlooked. With the pace at which the macroeconomic landscape is evolving, it is a dire need for protocols to integrate solutions t...'}]

Therefore, a moderately conservative trading approach is warranted to capitalize on opportunities while managing risks effectively.

Considering the overall bullish trend, positive news developments, and the need for a cautious approach, I would recommend a trading action of 0.7 to reflect a high level of confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately for maximizing long-term profitability.

*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is experiencing fluctuations with a slightly bearish trend due to recent sell signals and volatile average gas prices. The news analyst report, on the other hand, paints a positive outlook for Ethereum, citing developments such as Visa's interest in simplifying gas fee payments and the bullish sentiment surrounding Ethereum ETFs and liquid staking protocols. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a balanced approach, considering both on-chain data and news sentiment to make informed trading decisions.

Synthesizing these reports, it is evident that while short-term market trends may be uncertain, the long-term outlook for Ethereum appears favorable. Factors such as increased accessibility, positive news developments, and potential growth opportunities in scalability and decentralization point towards a positive market trend for Ethereum in the future. Therefore, it is crucial to prioritize long-term profitability and risk management in trading decisions.

Considering the overall market trend and the importance of managing risks effectively, I would take a moderately conservative approach in my trading strategy. I would assign a trading action of 0.5, reflecting moderate confidence in the positive long-term trend of the ETH market while also acknowledging the short-term uncertainties. This approach allows for capitalizing on opportunities while mitigating risks effectively in the ever-changing cryptocurrency market.

Analysts foresee that by the year of 2026, Ethereum\'s L2 rollups will generate the majority of fees. Here\'s how this major indicator increased in seven months in 2023.\n\nEthereum (ETH) fees "outperformed" Ether price; bullish sign?\n\nIn the last seven months, the cumulative volume of Ethereum (ETH) fees increased by 176%. Over a similar period, the price of the second largest cryptocurrency only grew by 53%. Last time this "imbalance" was registered in 2020 after two years of the Crypto Winter.\n\nIn 2023 #Ethereum fees have climbed 176% vs. the price, up 53%. The relationship between the two was instructive for the last bull market when fees outpaced price in 2020 after a two year decline. -@Jamie1Coutts pic.twitter.com/0oIF54OgOK ‚Äî Chris Burniske (@cburniske) August 12, 2023\n\nCryptocurrency veteran and seasoned blockchain researcher Chris Burniske posted these observations commenting on a thesis by Bloomberg Intelligence\'s analyst Jamie Coutts. Burniske also admitted that the correlation between these two indicators was "instructive" in previous rallies.\n\nAt the same time, migration of users from Ethereum\'s L1 to various L2 ecosystems is a dominant process in the ecosystem that heavily affects the indicators of fees.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, the second largest Ethereum L2 Optimism (OP) surprisingly flipped Arbitrum (ARB), the #1 scaler, in a number of metrics thanks to the overhyped Worldcoin (WDC) token release.\n\nOptimism (OP) exceeded Arbitrum (ARB) in the daily transactions volume and almost managed to eclipse it in the number of active wallets.\n\nL2s on fire in 2023, but we are still early\n\nHowever, by printing time, Arbitrum\'s (ARB) TVL is more than twice as high as that of Optimism (OP). Arbitrum\'s DeFi protocols total $5.94 billion in locked assets, while Optimism-based protocols only logged $2.82 billion.\n\nThings have only just started for L2s though. In seven months only, their share in Ethereum (ETH) ecosystem fees increased by more than 3x and almost reached 14%. The number of active addresses across L2s exceeded 900,000, Coutts\' report says.\n\nShould L2 adoption keep this pace, major scaling solutions like Arbitrum (ARB), Optimism (OP) and zkSync will be responsible for 20% of Ethereum (ETH) fees by the end of 2023.\n\nIn three years, they will surpass L1\'s numbers, analysts conclude.'}, {'id': 14, 'time': 'Sat, 12 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'One Mid-Cap Ethereum and Solana Rival Is Flashing a Bullish Signal, According to Crypto Analytics Firm Santiment - The Daily Hodl', 'content': "A top-50 altcoin by market cap could be on the verge of an upside move, according to blockchain analytics platform Santiment.\n\nThe analytics platform says that the native token of smart contract-enabled blockchain Aptos (APT) could reach ‚Äúanother higher high‚Äù after partnering with software maker Microsoft on artificial intelligence (AI) and web3 projects.\n\n‚ÄúAptos has decoupled after its partnership with Microsoft was announced to build AI tools for blockchain integrations.

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
The news articles suggest a mixed outlook for Ethereum (ETH) in the cryptocurrency market. On one hand, there are bullish signals indicating potential price growth, such as the increase in Ethereum fees outpacing the price growth, the potential for L2 rollups to generate the majority of fees by 2026, and the partnership between Aptos and Microsoft. However, there are also warnings of a possible price correction, as indicated by a trader's prediction of a rally to $2,500 followed by a decline to $1,500, and concerns raised by the transfer of large amounts of Shiba Inu and Ethereum by Voyager to Coinbase. Overall, the market trend for Ethereum appears to be uncertain, with potential for both growth and correction in the near future.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the market trend for ETH is bullish, with indicators such as increasing open price, total transactions, successful transactions, total value transferred, and a positive MACD signal. The high level of network activity and positive market sentiment suggest a continued upward trajectory for ETH.

The news analyst report further supports this bullish trend, highlighting positive developments such as the migration of the Y00ts NFT Collection to Ethereum, endorsements from industry leaders, and the introduction of PayPal's stablecoin on the Ethereum platform. These factors indicate a growing confidence in ETH's capabilities and potential for increased demand.

In reflection, a balanced approach considering both on-chain data analysis and news sentiment has been effective in making informed trading decisions. Prioritizing long-term profitability and risk management over short-term gains has yielded positive outcomes. Therefore, a moderately conservative trading approach is warranted to navigate potential risks and maximize profitability effectively.

Considering the overall bullish trend and positive developments surrounding ETH, I would take a trading action of 0.8, reflecting a high level of confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately for long-term profitability.

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the data indicates a bullish trend for ETH, with increasing open prices, total transactions, total gas used, and total value transferred. The MACD signal has been mostly indicating a buy trend, suggesting positive momentum in the market. However, the recent switch to a sell signal should be monitored closely for potential changes in the trend.

The news analyst report also supports a positive outlook for ETH, with significant investments in Ethereum projects and a growing number of non-zero Ethereum addresses. These developments signal increasing interest and adoption of Ethereum, which could drive the price higher. However, challenges such as price resistance and declining DApp activity may hinder a significant breakout.

In reflection, a balanced approach considering both on-chain data and news sentiment has been effective in making informed trading decisions. Prioritizing long-term profitability and risk management has been successful in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market.

Based on the synthesized reports, the market trend for ETH appears to be cautiously optimistic with potential for growth but also facing resistance at key price levels. Therefore, a moderately conservative trading approach is warranted to capitalize on opportunities while managing risks effectively.

Considering the overall bullish trend, positive news developments, and the need for a cautious approach, I would recommend a trading action of 0.7 to reflect a high level of confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately for maximizing long-term profitability.

Synthesizing these reports, it is evident that while short-term market trends may be uncertain, the long-term outlook for Ethereum appears favorable. Factors such as increased accessibility, positive news developments, and potential growth opportunities in scalability and decentralization point towards a positive market trend for Ethereum in the future. Therefore, it is crucial to prioritize long-term profitability and risk management in trading decisions.

Considering the overall market trend and the importance of managing risks effectively, I would take a moderately conservative approach in my trading strategy.

This approach allows for capitalizing on opportunities while mitigating risks effectively in the ever-changing cryptocurrency market.

The news of Visa introducing a new way to pay for Ethereum gas fees directly using Visa cards indicates a significant step towards increasing accessibility and usability of blockchain-based transactions. This development could potentially lead to a higher adoption rate of Ethereum and increase the overall demand for ETH. As more users find it easier to pay for gas fees with Visa cards, it could drive up the demand for ETH, potentially leading to a bullish trend in the ETH market. Additionally, Visa's active exploration of the crypto sector, including settlement payments using USDC on Ethereum, further reinforces the positive sentiment towards cryptocurrencies like ETH.

"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the data indicates a bullish trend for ETH, with increasing open prices, total transactions, total gas used, and total value transferred. The MACD signal has been mostly indicating a buy trend, suggesting positive momentum in the market. However, the recent switch to a sell signal should be monitored closely for potential changes in the trend.

The news analyst report also supports a positive outlook for ETH, with significant investments in Ethereum projects and a growing number of non-zero Ethereum addresses. These developments signal increasing interest and adoption of Ethereum, which could drive the price higher. However, challenges such as price resistance and declining DApp activity may hinder a significant breakout.

In reflection, a balanced approach considering both on-chain data and news sentiment has been effective in making informed trading decisions. Prioritizing long-term profitability and risk management has been successful in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market.

Based on the synthesized reports, the market trend for ETH appears to be cautiously optimistic with potential for growth but also facing resistance at key price levels. Therefore, a moderately conservative trading approach is warranted to capitalize on opportunities while managing risks effectively.

Considering the overall bullish trend, positive news developments, and the need for a cautious approach, I would recommend a trading action of 0.7 to reflect a high level of confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately for maximizing long-term profitability.

Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing uncertainty and potentially bearish trends. The fluctuating total transactions, gas prices, and decreasing total value transferred indicate a lack of clear direction in the market. Additionally, the MACD signal switching between buy and sell suggests further uncertainty.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights positive developments such as Visa's new payment method for Ethereum gas fees, which could potentially increase demand for ETH and lead to a bullish trend in the market. Visa's active exploration of the crypto sector also adds to the positive sentiment towards cryptocurrencies like ETH.

In reflection, it is evident that a balanced approach considering both on-chain data and news sentiment is crucial for making informed trading decisions. While the on-chain data suggests a bearish trend, the positive news developments could potentially drive up demand for ETH in the long term.

Considering the mixed outlook from the reports and the importance of long-term profitability and risk management, a moderately conservative trading approach is warranted. It is essential to closely monitor key indicators and news developments to make strategic decisions.

The platform has established itself as the crypto ecosystem‚Äôs benchmark for Layer 1 infrastructure. The company‚Äôs leadership is nevertheless significantly contested. Indeed, with the increased dynamism of the technology market globally, new Layer 1 projects are regularly emerging. Their ambition is to rival or even dethrone Ethereum in this sector. To achieve this, these initiatives propose technological improvements. They also provide enhanced scaling capabilities. Operational advances that generally translate into lower transaction fees for users. In short, they want to do better than Ethereum. But can they? The truth is, it‚Äôs extremely difficult to predict with any certainty which project(s) will be able to supplant Ethereum. Admittedly, many of these crypto initiatives are not lacking in relevance. However, this is without taking into account the vast operational network that Ethereum has built to establish its market dominance. With that in mind, we‚Äôll take a closer look at Layer 1 blockchain technology and the particularities of the one developed by Ethereum. We‚Äôll then compare some of the crypto industry‚Äôs most popular Layer 1 projects with Ethereum‚Äôs.\n\nA look back at the Layer 1 concept\n\nTo assess whether Ethereum‚Äôs Layer 1 could be surpassed by other projects, it‚Äôs vital to understand its meaning and role within the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nLayer 1, often abbreviated to L1, is the very foundation of blockchain. It is the main blockchain that functions autonomously, without depending on other systems for its operation. It is this independence that distinguishes it from Layer 2 solutions, which are built on top of Layer 1 to enhance scalability and performance without modifying the underlying blockchain.\n\nLayer 0, on the other hand, is the underlying infrastructure layer that facilitates communication between different blockchains. It is a network of networks that enables Layer 1 blockchains to communicate with each other.\n\nLayer 1 blockchains have their own network of validator nodes responsible for validating transactions and blocks. They also use specific consensus mechanisms, such as Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS) or Proof of Authority (PoA), to guarantee network security and integrity.\n\nIconic blockchains such as Bitcoin, Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Ethereum all operate as Layer 1, each with its own token, which serves as the fuel for transactions and interactions within its ecosystem.\n\nSo what distinguishes Ethereum‚Äôs Layer 1 from other first-layer blockchains?\n\nSingularity of Ethereum Layer 1\n\nEthereum, as a Layer 1 project, occupies a prominent place in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, and for good reason. Its platform is distinguished by unique features that have redefined the possibilities offered by blockchain technology.\n\nOne of Ethereum‚Äôs major innovations is the introduction of smart contracts. These autonomous programs run automatically as soon as predefined conditions are met, without the need for human intervention.\n\nThanks to smart contracts, Ethereum has facilitated the development of decentralized applications (dApps). This has reduced dependence on traditional intermediaries, broadening the range of services available in the crypto ecosystem. In addition, Ethereum has played a crucial role in promoting interoperability between different blockchain platforms.\n\nWhile remaining true to its principles of decentralization, Ethereum is constantly seeking solutions to scale-up challenges, in order to satisfy a rapidly growing and demanding community.\n\nHowever, despite its leading status, Ethereum faces major challenges, particularly with regard to network scaling and high transaction costs. These challenges underline the importance of constant evolution of the platform. Other Layer 1 projects are emerging with innovative proposals, seeking to fill Ethereum‚Äôs gaps while offering new functionalities.\n\nLayer 1 projects competing with Ethereum\n\nThe cryptocurrency industry is full of Layer 1 blockchain projects. Given the multitude of offerings available, it would be tedious to cover them all here. However, by observing current trends in the sector, several of them seem to be gaining credibility and could potentially rival the current leaders.\n\nTake Cardano, founded in 2015 by Charles Hoskinson. He often describes his project as an ‚Äúenhanced version of Ethereum‚Äù. Focused on innovation, Cardano is a decentralized blockchain based on proof-of-stake (PoS). It offers developers the possibility of creating smart contracts, while guaranteeing fast, low-cost transactions. One of Cardano‚Äôs notable achievements is the Ouroboros protocol, the first peer-verified blockchain protocol, ensuring decentralization, security and scalability.\n\nRipple (XRP) is a major player in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Although Ripple is not a Layer 1 blockchain per se, its network, RippleNet, was...'}]

"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is experiencing fluctuations with a slightly bearish trend due to recent sell signals and volatile average gas prices. The news analyst report, on the other hand, paints a positive outlook for Ethereum, citing developments such as Visa's interest in simplifying gas fee payments and the bullish sentiment surrounding Ethereum ETFs and liquid staking protocols. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a balanced approach, considering both on-chain data and news sentiment to make informed trading decisions.

Synthesizing these reports, it is evident that while short-term market trends may be uncertain, the long-term outlook for Ethereum appears favorable. Factors such as increased accessibility, positive news developments, and potential growth opportunities in scalability and decentralization point towards a positive market trend for Ethereum in the future. Therefore, it is crucial to prioritize long-term profitability and risk management in trading decisions.

Considering the overall market trend and the importance of managing risks effectively, I would take a moderately conservative approach in my trading strategy.

It uses a radical blockchain technology known as Proof-Of-Process (PoP), which is a hybrid of Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) models. This unique consensus model enhances the transaction capacity and reduces transaction fees, making BTCS more efficient for everyday transactions.\n\nMoreover, the Bitcoin Spark network includes a separate layer for smart contracts, which can use different programming languages. This layer reaches consensus on the main network but allows innovative dApps to be developed without causing transaction congestion.\n\nDeciphering Proof-of-Process\n\nThe PoP model is a novel concept introduced by Bitcoin Spark. It combines the principles of PoW and PoS with a unique algorithm that restricts linear rewards based on stake size or raw processing power. This innovative approach prevents the concentration of power among large-scale miners.\n\nBTCS mining requires an easy-to-use mining program that can be installed on any device. This program automatically limits the device's processing power usage, thereby controlling the mining capability. The rewards for miners are proportional to the processing power they rent out to the network, fostering a fair distribution of BTCS tokens.\n\nA New Era of Mining\n\nBitcoin Spark's mining approach is a significant departure from traditional methods. Bitcoin's PoW model involves solving complex mathematical problems using high-end computers, consuming a lot of energy. In contrast, Ethereum's PoS model requires participants to lock a certain amount of ETH to earn validation rights.\n\nBitcoin Spark, with its PoP model, simplifies this process. It allows users to mine using any device, making mining more accessible and promoting decentralization. This method also ensures a fair distribution of BTCS tokens regardless of the size of the stake or the computing power of the mining device.\n\nRewarding Network Participants\n\nBitcoin Spark has devised innovative ways to reward network participants. The primary source of revenue comes from a decentralized CPU rental system. Users pay with BTCS tokens to access processing power, which then goes into the mining rewards pool.\n\nThe project also earns revenue from advertising. Half of the revenue from advertisements on the Bitcoin Spark application and website is distributed among network participants and miners. The community actively polices the advertising content, ensuring a clean and trustworthy platform.\n\nBitcoin Spark's Tokenomics\n\nBitcoin Spark's tokenomics closely mirror that of Bitcoin, with a maximum supply of 21 million tokens. However, the time to reach this maximum supply is significantly longer for BTCS, allowing for a prolonged period of mining rewards distribution.\n\nDuring the ICO phase, BTCS was offered at $1.50, with an additional 20% bonus. This presented an excellent opportunity for investors to participate in the project's growth.\n\nThe Future of Bitcoin Spark\n\nBitcoin Spark's unique features and solutions looks to stir interest among investors and crypto enthusiasts. Its potential for disrupting the crypto space makes it an intriguing project to watch.\n\nWhile Ethereum continues to maintain its stronghold with its unique offerings, Bitcoin Spark is rapidly emerging as a strong contender. As both platforms continue to evolve, the competition for dominance in the crypto world is heating up.\n\nFind out more about Bitcoin Spark on:\n\nWebsite: https://bitcoinspark.org/\n\nBuy BTCS: https://network.bitcoinspark.org/register\n\nThis post was authored by an external contributor and does not represent Benzinga's opinions and has not been edited for content.

It was the first blockchain to challenge and match the dominance of the Bitcoin network.\n\nEthereum is a decentralized platform that allows developers to create, publish, and distribute applications and smart contracts.\n\nWith its innovative features and services, and a community-run ecosystem that supports thousands of decentralized applications, it quickly gained popularity among investors and users worldwide.\n\nPerhaps its most notable feature is the ability to deploy smart contracts, which accelerated the development of the crypto industry.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum Investors Await Rally as Addresses in Profits Hit Monthly Low\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum Transaction Fees\n\nTransaction fees, or gas fees, are incurred when executing a transaction on the Ethereum network.\n\nEvery network action, whether sending Ether (ETH) or interacting with a smart contract, requires computational power. Miners, who validate transactions and maintain the network, are compensated with gas fees for their efforts.\n\nGas fees are denominated in Gwei, a tiny fraction of an ETH.\n\nOne Gwei is equivalent to 0.000000001 ETH. When you initiate a transaction, you specify a gas limit, the maximum amount of computational work you are willing to pay for.\n\nAdditionally, you set a gas price, the amount of Gwei you are willing to pay per unit of gas. The total transaction fee is calculated by multiplying the gas limit by the gas price.\n\nFactors Contributing to High Ethereum Fees\n\nSource: CNN\n\nSeveral factors have contributed to the high fees on the Ethereum network:\n\n1. Network Congestion\n\nAs the popularity of Ethereum has soared, the number of transactions on the network has increased dramatically. This surge in demand has led to network congestion, causing delays and driving up transaction fees.\n\nDuring peak hours, when the network is crowded with users, gas prices tend to skyrocket as users compete to process their transactions.\n\n2. Gas Limit and Gas Price\n\nThe gas limit and gas price you set for your transactions can significantly impact the fees you pay. You will pay more for your transactions if you set a high gas limit or a high gas price.\n\nFinding a balance and optimizing these parameters to minimize fees while ensuring your transactions are processed promptly is important.\n\n3. Smart Contract Complexity\n\nThe complexity of smart contracts also plays a role in determining transaction fees. More complex smart contracts require more computational resources, resulting in higher gas fees.\n\nAs decentralized applications (dApps) and their functionalities become more intricate, the network experiences increased congestion, leading to higher gas prices.\n\n4. Ethereum Network Upgrades\n\nThe Ethereum network has undergone several upgrades to improve scalability and address the issue of high fees. One such upgrade is EIP-1559, which introduced a base fee mechanism to make gas prices more predictable and reduce fee volatility.\n\nHowever, these upgrades take time to implement and may not immediately alleviate the problem of high fees.\n\nHow to Reduce and Avoid High Ethereum Fees\n\nSource: CNBC\n\nNow that we understand the factors contributing to high Ethereum fees let‚Äôs explore some practical tips to reduce and avoid them:\n\n1. Optimize Gas Limit and Gas Price\n\nTo minimize transaction fees, optimizing the gas limit and gas price for each transaction is crucial.\n\nTo decrease fees, you can set a lower gas limit and gas price, but avoid setting them too low to prevent transaction delays.\n\nExperiment with different values and find the optimal cost and transaction speed balance.\n\n2. Use Layer-2 Scaling Solutions\n\nLayer-2 scaling solutions encompass technologies constructed on the Ethereum network to boost transaction throughput and cut fees.\n\nThese solutions, such as Optimistic Rollups and zkSync, process transactions off-chain or more optimally, alleviating the burden on the Ethereum mainnet. By utilizing layer-2 solutions, you can benefit from faster and cheaper transactions.\n\n3. Choose Off-Peak Times\n\nGas fees tend to be lower during off-peak times with less network congestion.\n\nYou can take advantage of lower...'}]

If you\'ve been waiting for the right time to invest, now may seem like a smart buying opportunity, as crypto prices steadily inch closer to their previous peaks.\n\nBut some investors are still cautious, which is understandable considering how quickly the crypto market crashed last year. The last thing anyone wants is to invest while prices are higher, only to have the market plummet yet again.\n\nSo is it really a smart time to invest in Ethereum? The answer is, it depends.\n\nThe case for investing now\n\nMarket volatility is always unnerving, but it\'s especially challenging in the crypto space. While Ethereum has experienced incredible highs over the last few years, the lows can be unbearable for many investors.\n\nHowever, remember that crypto is a long-term investment. Even the strongest cryptocurrencies will likely see extreme volatility in the near term, but the best investments have the potential for significant long-term growth.\n\nEthereum remains one of the strongest players in the industry, and it has some major advantages over its competitors, including:\n\nIts sheer size: With a market cap of around $221 billion, Ethereum makes up just under 20% of the entire crypto market. While popularity alone doesn\'t necessarily make for a strong investment, it\'s tough for smaller cryptocurrencies to compete with a behemoth like Ethereum -- putting it in a league of its own.\n\nWith a market cap of around $221 billion, Ethereum makes up just under 20% of the entire crypto market. While popularity alone doesn\'t necessarily make for a strong investment, it\'s tough for smaller cryptocurrencies to compete with a behemoth like Ethereum -- putting it in a league of its own. It\'s the leading smart contract platform: The Ethereum blockchain is host to a wide variety of decentralized applications (dApps), ranging from NFT marketplaces to metaverse applications to decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. Although many other networks (such as Solana and Cardano ) can also host dApps, Ethereum is far and away the most popular platform.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain is host to a wide variety of decentralized applications (dApps), ranging from NFT marketplaces to metaverse applications to decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. Although many other networks (such as and ) can also host dApps, Ethereum is far and away the most popular platform. It\'s constantly updating: Last year, Ethereum developers successfully completed The Merge, a landmark upgrade that moved the network from the energy-intensive proof-of-work system to the far more efficient proof-of-stake. But there are many other updates still in the pipeline -- most notably The Surge, which should vastly improve the network\'s speed and reduce transaction fees.\n\nIn other words, Ethereum has a lot going for it right now. It\'s consistently been one of the clear leaders in the crypto space, and if it continues its upgrades and improvements, it has the potential to soar even more over time.\n\nWhen it may be best to avoid Ethereum\n\nAs with any cryptocurrency, Ethereum is still largely speculative. While it has many distinct advantages, those are mostly speculative right now, too.\n\nIf NFTs, the metaverse, or DeFi become more mainstream, Ethereum will benefit from it. But if those applications never catch on with the public, the crypto may have a tough time staying relevant. Right now, nobody can say how this space will fare over the long term, and there\'s always a chance it could fail.\n\nThis isn\'t to say you shouldn\'t invest in Ethereum for these reasons. For many investors, the potentially lucrative earnings outweigh the risk of crypto\'s speculative nature. But in general, even the "safest" cryptocurrencies are still more volatile than stocks -- which can be a deal-breaker for more risk-averse investors.\n\nIf you\'re on the fence, ask yourself which of these two scenarios you\'d regret more: investing now and losing money if Ethereum fails, or not investing and missing out on those earnings if it succeeds.\n\nThere\'s no right or wrong answer here, but it can help you determine where your priorities lie. If your biggest concern is making a bad investment and losing money, crypto in general may not be the best fit for you right now.\n\nCrypto can be incredibly volatile, and it\'s important to consider your risk tolerance before you invest. That said, Ethereum has built a reputation for being a leader in the industry, and it has plenty of advantages that could make it a smart buy right now.'}]

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
The news articles suggest a mixed sentiment towards Ethereum (ETH) in the market. On one hand, the unveiling of Shibarium, Shiba Inu's layer-2 network on the Ethereum mainnet, could potentially enhance transaction throughput and cost-efficiency, positioning Ethereum as a strong player in the decentralized applications space. However, the revelation that former U.S. President Donald Trump holds a significant amount of ETH in his wallet, coupled with his past skepticism towards cryptocurrencies, may introduce some uncertainty and volatility. Overall, with Ethereum's market cap, leading smart contract platform status, and ongoing updates, it appears to have strong potential for growth, but investors should remain cautious of external factors that could impact its performance.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing uncertainty and potentially bearish trends. The fluctuating total transactions, gas prices, and decreasing total value transferred indicate a lack of clear direction in the market. Additionally, the MACD signal switching between buy and sell suggests further uncertainty.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights positive developments such as Visa's new payment method for Ethereum gas fees, which could potentially increase demand for ETH and lead to a bullish trend in the market. Visa's active exploration of the crypto sector also adds to the positive sentiment towards cryptocurrencies like ETH.

In reflection, it is evident that a balanced approach considering both on-chain data and news sentiment is crucial for making informed trading decisions. While the on-chain data suggests a bearish trend, the positive news developments could potentially drive up demand for ETH in the long term.

Considering the mixed outlook from the reports and the importance of long-term profitability and risk management, a moderately conservative trading approach is warranted. It is essential to closely monitor key indicators and news developments to make strategic decisions.

Therefore, I would take a slightly bullish stance on the market trend with a trading action of 0.3, reflecting moderate confidence in the potential long-term bullish trend driven by positive news developments. This decision allows for strategic risk management while aiming to maximize profitability in the volatile ETH market.

No other social media platform allows everyday folk to interact with celebrities, CEOs, and multi-millionaires/billionaires the way Twitter does. For that reason, one may find several instances where influential figures on the platform voice their opinions in a candid non-corporate-like manner.\n\nOn August 17th, Twitter became home to a daring statement by Charles Hoskinson, CEO of Cardano.

The CEO then responded by highlighting key advantages Cardano has over Ethereum, the blockchain the user seemingly preferred.\n\nCool, let‚Äôs make a bet.

With 1,000 stacking pools, each of which processes 1,000 TPS, Cardano could achieve a throughput of up to one million transactions per second,‚Äù said Hoskinson in his video.\n\nHydra was first revealed during an AMA video on Hoskinson‚Äôs Youtube channel in 2020. When asked about updates on the layer-2 solution his company has been working on, he had this to say:\n\n‚ÄúWe are going to keep adding resources to Hydra, and we‚Äôve been trying to identify some teams so we can parallelize the workstream because it‚Äôs such a high commercial priority.

Gensler sees any token besides Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, and Litecoin as a security. Accordingly, the SEC is willing to sue any exchange that trades in significant sums of these supposed ‚Äòunregistered securities.‚Äô\n\nAs a result, many exchanges, such as Revolut, have been seen suspending trading of tokens such as ADA, SOL, and MATIC.\n\nHowever, Cardano and Hoskinson look at the application of ADA and its corresponding blockchain as technologies beyond the simple potential of financial investment.\n\nFor example, in 2021, Hoskinson tweeted his celebration of Cardano technology being used in Ethiopian schools as a form of encrypted credentials for five million students.\n\nDropped by the MOE today to discuss the digital transformation of Ethiopia's educational credentials.

Key trends to monitor include total transactions, gas prices, total value transferred, MACD signals, institutional interest, and competition from other projects.

Taking into account the synthesized reports, it is advisable to adopt a moderately conservative trading approach to capitalize on opportunities while managing risks effectively. Long-term strategies should be prioritized over short-term gains, and close monitoring of key indicators and news developments is crucial to make informed decisions in the volatile cryptocurrency market.

The news analyst report further supports this bullish outlook, with developments such as Ethereum staking gaining popularity, the potential introduction of Ether futures ETFs in the US, and reduced volatility compared to other assets.

Its goal is to outdo the famous Babydoge, and it gained immediate traction.\n\nA little bit of background for context: The Shiba Inu coin was released two years ago as a memecoin centered around decentralization, by an anonymous founder called Ryoshi. Recently, it evolved beyond a simple meme and launched its own Layer-2 blockchain, Shibarium. Interestingly, the Shibarium blockchain went live the same day as the Babyshiba launch, sparking speculation about the individuals behind this new project. Additionally, BabyShiba was also launched in August, coinciding with the same month as the Shiba Inu launch.\n\nWith the crypto world's attention on Shiba Inu due to the Shibarium blockchain, Babyshiba emerged at the perfect time. This impeccable timing suggests the launch was a well-calculated plan by its creators. Babyshiba not only pays tribute to Ryoshi's vision embodied in Shiba Inu but also aims to surpass Babydoge, a derivative of the renowned Doge Coin.\n\nThe project quickly gained substantial momentum and attracted a community aptly named the BabyShibArmy. Some are suggesting a repeat of the Babydoge magic, as the project's Telegram group experiences ongoing growth and the community remains highly active on Twitter (X). As the community plays a vital role in any memecoin and was initially the driving force behind Shiba Inu, BabyShiba likely has a promising future.\n\nOn the technical side, BabyShiba is tradable on Uniswap, an Ethereum DEX, and imposes a 1% tax allocated for marketing. Daily updates on marketing initiatives are visible in their Telegram group, with full transparency maintained on expenditure. Already, over 20 significant crypto influencers have talked about their project, and this figure is steadily rising. The project's website is meticulously designed, and they have published a whitepaper elaborating on their vision.\n\nStory continues\n\nGiven its potential to become the top memecoin of summer 2023 and perhaps one of the most successful ever (alongside its rival Babydoge), the BabyShiba project deserves close attention. We encourage you to monitor its progress over the coming weeks and judge its potential for yourself.\n\nSocials:\n\nWebsite: https://babyshib.vip\n\n\n\nTelegram: t.me/babyshiberc\n\n\n\nX (Twitter): https://twitter.com/babyshiberc\n\n\n\nWhitepaper: https://babyshiba-1.gitbook.io/babyshiba-shibpaper/\n\n\n\nEmail: contact@babyshib.vip\n\n\n\n\n\nCONTACT: Adams joshua Babyshiba contact@babyshib.vip\n\n\n\n"}, {'id': 0, 'time': 'Sat, 19 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Should You Buy Ethereum While It's Still Below $2,000? - The Motley Fool", 'content': 'For the year, Ethereum (ETH 0.59%) is up 45%. While that recent performance is impressive, there are still plenty of skeptics out there. After all, a a recent price of about $1,730, Ethereum is 64% below its all-time high of $4,892 from two years ago, and hasn\'t had the type of monster rally many investors were expecting when it completed The Merge, a system upgrade, last September.\n\nIn fact, Ethereum is trading at almost exactly the same price it was one year ago. And it has had unexpected difficulty breaking through the $2,000 price level. So is Ethereum undervalued or not? To answer that question, there are three important factors to consider.\n\nInnovation leader\n\nEthereum recently celebrated its eighth birthday, and it\'s fascinating to look back and see how far Ethereum has come in such a relatively short time. Ethereum has become the de facto benchmark standard that all other Layer-1 blockchains measure themselves against. There have been a large number of blockchains that have attempted to become "the next Ethereum" and failed -- and that list includes Cardano, Avalanche, and Solana.\n\nBy investing in Ethereum, you are investing in the innovation leader with a clear competitive advantage. Ethereum pioneered the concept of smart contracts for the blockchain and has consistently been first to market with new innovations. That includes the launch of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), new decentralized finance exchanges, and new gaming and metaverse experiences. Given Ethereum\'s track record of innovation, I\'m confident that there\'s plenty of upside potential ahead.\n\nDiversification benefits\n\nAll of that innovation happening on the Ethereum blockchain means that the size and scope of the Ethereum ecosystem continues to grow. Ethereum still has the largest community of blockchain developers in the world, and the number of use cases for Ethereum continues to grow. For example, Wall Street firms are experimenting with Ethereum as a new form of payment network, while manufacturing companies are experimenting with Ethereum\'s blockchain technology to improve their supply chains.\n\nFrom my perspective, Ethereum is simply the most diversified crypto that you can own in your portfolio. You\'re not investing in a one-trick pony, and that is really the key to Ethereum\'s allure for both retail and institutional investors. That\'s an important consideration during volatile and uncertain market conditions, when diversification is the key to riding out the tough times.\n\nRoadmap for success\n\nOne other key consideration is that Ethereum has a roadmap for success, so you can see exactly where Ethereum has been, and where it\'s headed. After The Merge, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin unveiled an updated roadmap that includes five new distinct stages, known as the Surge, Scourge, Verge, Purge, and Splurge. Even if each of those stages only lasts six months, that\'s still a three-year strategic vision. If you\'re a buy-and-hold investor, that\'s exactly what you want to see: a long-term plan for success.\n\nWhen you dig into the specific milestones on Ethereum\'s roadmap, that\'s when things get really interesting. For example, the current phase of development ("The Surge") has a goal of boosting Ethereum\'s transaction processing abilities to 100,000 transactions per second. That\'s blazingly fast speed, even faster than the theoretical maximum speed of the Visa card payment network (65,000 transactions per second). Eventually, says Buterin, the goal is to hit 1 million transactions per second.\n\nWhat could possibly go wrong?\n\nInvesting in crypto can be risky and speculative, and it\'s no different with Ethereum. So, yes, there\'s actually quite a bit that could go wrong for Ethereum. The Securities and Exchange Commission, for example, might decide that Ethereum is actually a security, thereby sending it to crypto purgatory and upending future plans for development. There\'s also a risk that an upstart "Ethereum killer" might truly emerge, dooming Ethereum to the dustbin of history.\n\nBut, as noted above, Ethereum has a strong track record of innovation, growth, and diversification. At recent prices it seems remarkably undervalued. Just two years ago, Ethereum was trading for nearly $5,000. So I\'m very confident buying Ethereum now, while it still seems to be trading at a discount. Over the long haul, Ethereum\'s upside potential is just too high to ignore.'}, {'id': 1, 'time': 'Sat, 19 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Is Ether the Same as Ethereum? - Watcher Guru', 'content': 'Is Ether the Same as Ethereum?\n\nCryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors often come across the terms Ethereum and Ether.\n\nHowever, there is a common misconception that these two terms are interchangeable.\n\nIn reality, Ethereum and Ether are distinct entities within the realm of digital currency.\n\nThis article aims to clarify the differences between Ethereum and Ether, providing a comprehensive understanding of their roles and functionalities in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nAlso read: Why are Ethereum Network Fees so High?\n\nSource: Forbes\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum is a blockchain-based platform that revolutionizes the way we interact with digital assets and decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nIt serves as a decentralized global platform for developers to create smart contracts and dApps without the need for intermediaries.\n\nEthereum‚Äôs blockchain technology allows for secure, transparent, and tamper-proof transactions and operations.\n\nFeatures and Benefits of Ethereum\n\nDecentralization: Ethereum operates on a decentralized network of nodes, eliminating the need for a central authority or third-party intermediaries. This decentralized approach ensures transparency and reduces the risk of censorship or manipulation. Smart Contracts: Ethereum introduced the concept of smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. These contracts automatically execute transactions and enforce agreements without the need for intermediaries, offering efficiency and automation in various industries. Decentralized Applications (dApps): Ethereum provides a platform for developers to build decentralized applications that operate on the blockchain. These dApps leverage the security, transparency, and immutability of the Ethereum network while offering a wide range of functionalities and use cases. Interoperability: Ethereum allows for interoperability with other blockchain networks, enabling seamless integration and communication between different decentralized platforms. This interoperability expands the potential for collaboration and innovation within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nUnderstanding Ether\n\nSource: CNN\n\nWhat is Ether?\n\nEther (ETH) is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network.\n\nWhile Ethereum is the platform, Ether serves as the fuel that powers transactions and operations within the network.\n\nEther stands as a digital asset that is purchasable, tradable, and usable for investment, payments, and exchange trading.\n\nAlso read: Ethereum: Donald Trump Holds Up To $500k ETH\n\nFunctions and Uses of Ether\n\nPayment Method: Ether is used as a means of payment for on-chain transactions within the Ethereum network.\n\n\n\nWhen users initiate transactions or execute smart contracts on Ethereum, they need to pay gas fees, which are calculated in Ether. These gas fees compensate the network participants, including miners, for their computational resources and effort in securing the blockchain. Investment: Ether can be seen as a digital asset that individuals can invest in for potential capital appreciation. Similar to other cryptocurrencies, the value of Ether is subject to market fluctuations and can provide opportunities for investors to generate profits.\n\n\n\nYet, remember that engaging in cryptocurrency investments involves risks and requires prudent consideration. Trading: Ether is listed and traded on various cryptocurrency exchanges, allowing users to buy, sell, and trade the digital asset. Traders can take advantage of price movements and volatility in the cryptocurrency market to potentially profit from their trading activities. Medium of Exchange: Some merchants and online retailers accept Ether as a form of payment for goods and services.\n\n\n\nThe use of Ether as a medium of exchange provides an alternative to traditional fiat currency transactions, offering faster and more secure transactions, especially for cross-border payments.\n\nEther vs. Ethereum: The Differences\n\nIt is crucial to understand the distinction between Ethereum and Ether to avoid confusion. Ethereum refers to the blockchain-based platform that enables the creation of decentralized applications and smart contracts.\n\nOn the other hand, Ether is the specific cryptocurrency that operates within the Ethereum network.\n\nWhile Ethereum is the infrastructure, it also serves as the digital asset and means of value exchange within that infrastructure.\n\nConclusion: Is Ether the Same as Ethereum?\n\nIn summary, Ethereum and Ether are integral components of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, but they are not interchangeable terms.\n\nFurthermore, Ethereum is a blockchain-based platform that facilitates the development and deployment of decentralized applications and smart contracts. Ether, on the other hand, is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, serving as a digital asset and payment method within the ecosystem.\n\nUnderstanding the distinctions between Ethereum and Ether i...'}]

As of recent metrics, XRP has settled at a 4.5% gain, still significantly outshining its rivals, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin, for instance, barely moved with a 0.2% increase, while Ethereum slightly ascended by 0.4%. In contrast, Cardano, a notable contender in the crypto market, saw its price dip by 0.4%.\n\nHowever, when we zoom out to look at the seven-day performance, the narrative changes a bit. Over a week, XRP suffered a notable decline, shedding 14% of its value. In comparison, Ethereum\'s value decreased by 9.3% and BNB\'s by 9.9% over the week. Cardano\'s seven-day performance also indicated a drop but at a lesser rate of 7.5%.\n\nAs reported by U.Today, XRP recently lost roughly 40% in a single month, underperforming other top cryptocurrencies and erasing its gains that were added because of the favorable Ripple ruling.\n\nThe SEC is fighting back\n\nDespite its impressive short-term performance, XRP remains clouded by uncertainties surrounding the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) appeal against Ripple.\n\nThe appeal, recently submitted by the SEC, challenges a July court order. This order had decided that Ripple\'s sales and offers of XRP on cryptocurrency trading platforms didn\'t lead investors to anticipate profits dependent on others\' efforts. Furthermore, it had ruled that XRP distributions as payment for services don\'t constitute an "investment of money."\n\nThis appeal\'s central issues revolve around the classification of XRP\'s offers and sales. One court has already indicated a disagreement with the initial Ripple decision, but some prominent voices within the XRP community have downplayed the significance of such a move.\n\nThe court previously recognized that institutional sales fit the Howey criteria. However, distinctions have been drawn regarding the categorization of coins sold directly to institutional investors compared to retail investors in secondary markets.'}, {'id': 4, 'time': 'Sun, 20 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Charles Hoskinson Ups the Ante as Ethereum Is Labelled A Cardano (ADA) Copycat - ZyCrypto', 'content': 'Advertisement\n\nCharles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano and a co-founder of Ethereum, has a history of teasing Ethereum and its co-founder Vitalik Buterin, but now he has stepped things up a notch, it seems. A discussion broke out about which ecosystem is better after a question was posted on ‚ÄòX‚Äô if Cardano would ever be an Ethereum competitor.\n\nOne user said that it was telling that Ethereum had to transition to a 2.0 version of what Cardano already is today. Another argued that Cardano followed Ethereum‚Äôs roadmap but was behind by years.\n\nAnd then came along an ‚ÄòX‚Äô user who said he predicted Hoskinson would stop talking about Hydra and look towards things that Ethereum developers are doing, essentially copying from them. He added that Hoskinson would soon say that ‚ÄúOur plan was always that if it works on Ethereum, we can just copy it, and actually, rollups and data availability have always been the future of Cardano too‚Äù.\n\nHoskinson on Fire\n\nCharles Hoskinson swallowed the bait and said he felt sorry for people obsessed with their blockchain, saying, ‚ÄúWe are living rent-free in the maxi minds. I pity them‚Äù.\n\nHe reminded the original poster that Hydra, one of the recent improvements to the popular blockchain, is live and evolving rapidly. Additionally, Hoskinson stated that Mithril is now operational, marking the initial move toward an enhanced ADA and light client approach. He explained that innovative transaction methods have been developed, including tiered pricing and Babel fees. Adding that, the concept of a roll-up strategy has been in place since the inception of Midnight four years ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe did not only defend Cardano but started to throw punches at Ethereum too, saying: ‚ÄúMeanwhile Ethereum has a dumpster fire of a consensus layer, has a terrible programming model that they can‚Äôt change, and are getting eaten alive by their own layer 2 ecosystem.‚Äù\n\nNo matter whose side you take, it is clear that Cardano is unfinished, and there is no dispute about that. Cardano‚Äôs development runs in stages and is now in the second last stage. While the current stage focuses on scaling and resource use, the final stage will see a fully decentralized community-governed ecosystem. Hoskinson thinks by then, Cardano will serve as a blueprint for other blockchains and be ‚Äúsubstantially more decentralized than all cryptocurrencies on the market‚Äù.'}, {'id': 10, 'time': 'Sun, 20 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Pre-Mine Ethereum Whale Wakes Up After 8 Years of Silence - U.Today', 'content': "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today.

A case in point, an Ethereum ICO participant, who had maintained silence for eight years, orchestrated a substantial transfer of 641 ETH, currently valued at around $1.07 million.\n\nMajor bear alert\n\nThe crypto community remains divided over the significance of these reawakenings. The prevailing sentiment suggests that the resurgence may portend bearish market trends. This belief has garnered support from recent historical trends. For instance, following the previous instance of a similar whale reactivation in July, the ETH price plummeted by a staggering 20.42%.\n\nETH to USD by CoinMarketCap\n\nThe skeptics' position finds further validation in the months spanning from May to mid-July, during which weekly awakenings of such dormant wallets precipitated a 17.3% decline in the ETH price.\n\nAs the awakened whale navigates the current market landscape, the community should brace for potential fluctuations. All eyes are now fixated on the awakening whale and the cryptic tides it might usher in.\n\nIn this ever-evolving narrative of crypto trends, the reanimation of a pre-mine Ethereum whale after nearly a decade serves as a poignant reminder of the intricate interplay between early investors, market sentiment and the pulse of digital assets."}, {'id': 20, 'time': 'Sun, 20 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum Layer-2 Arbitrum Sustains Growth and User Influx Following ARB Airdrop, Total Assets Reach $5.77 Billion ... - Cryptonews', 'content': 'Ethereum Layer-2 Arbitrum Sustains Growth and User Influx Following ARB Airdrop, Total Assets Reach $5.77 Billion: Report\n\nSource: Arbitrum\n\nPer Nansen‚Äôs Arbitrum Quarterly Report for Q2 2023, the Arbitrum (ARB) airdrop on March 23, 2023, led to a peak in users and transactions. Following the ARB airdrop, daily transactions and user numbers have consistently exceeded the chain‚Äôs past averages.\n\nArbitrum, an Ethereum rollup hosting asset valued at $5.77 billion, sustained robust growth in the previous quarter. Throughout Q2, Arbitrum maintained its momentum by enhancing its infrastructure and advancing its ecosystem.\n\nAfter the ARB airdrop incentives concluded and the airdrop resulted in a ‚Äúsell-the-news‚Äù reaction for the native token and its associated ecosystem projects, noteworthy activity levels persisted, evident in transaction and user counts surpassing pre-airdrop figures.\n\nThe influx of new users underscores Arbitrum‚Äôs enduring strength and flourishing ecosystem.\n\nA group of ‚Äúsuper airdrop hunters‚Äù who amassed ARB tokens using multiple Ethereum addresses contributed significantly to the selling pressure.\n\nThe ARB token experienced significant selling during the airdrop, causing its price to plummet from $10.29 to $1 in just a few hours.\n\nNansen‚Äôs report stated that the stability of Arbitrum after its Airdrop ‚Äúpoints towards more organic activity‚Äù as new users have been increasing, even ‚Äúsurpassing Ethereum on certain days in Q2.‚Äù\n\nIn the second quarter of 2023, daily transactions and gas prices on Arbitrum One, one of the critical components of Arbitrum utilizing Arbitrum Rollup technology to enhance transaction throughput while maintaining security, remained steady, averaging 800k transactions.\n\nSource: Nansen\n\nThe quarter saw a consistent rise in transaction count compared to the previous quarter, indicating heightened activity since the airdrop. Daily active addresses on Arbitrum remained stable at approximately 200k throughout the quarter.\n\nConversely, there has been a gradual increase in the number of new wallets initiating transactions on Arbitrum since the beginning of the year. On specific days in Q2, this count surpassed Ethereum‚Äôs new wallet activity.\n\nArbitrum (ARB) Airdrop Spurs Price Surge and Ecosystem Growth Since March\n\nThe announcement of the Arbitrum (ARB) airdrop on March 16 led to a significant price increase in native tokens of projects within the Arbitrum ecosystem, including GMX (GMX), Magic (MAGIC), Gains Network (GNS), and Radiant Network (RDNT).\n\nThis surge was directly tied to the ARB airdrop, fueling growth in the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nThe price surge occurred mainly between the airdrop announcement and its execution on March 23.\n\nAs noted in a report, ‚ÄúOnce the airdrop launched alongside the $ARB token introduction, ecosystem token prices began to decrease, following a typical ‚Äòsell the news‚Äô pattern.‚Äù\n\nThe Arbitrum airdrop allocated 1.1% of the total 12.75 billion ARB supply to the ecosystem‚Äôs DAOs. This allocation was crucial for a positive outlook on the Arbitrum ecosystem, as DAOs could leverage ARB incentives to encourage usage.\n\nHowever, the airdrop amounts for individual projects in the Arbitrum ecosystem were relatively smaller. Only GMX and MAGIC received allocations exceeding $10 million.\n\nMost projects received less than $500,000 worth of ARB tokens, which needed to be improved to incentivize liquidity across a large user base.\n\nWith the speculation surrounding the ARB airdrop subsiding, the growing number of new wallets implies increased organic engagement.\n\nDaily active users, transaction count, and on-chain value have all settled at levels higher than pre-airdrop figures.\n\nThe upward trends in gas fee expenditure and the establishment of new wallets further signify the growing utilization of the network.'}, {'id': 3, 'time': 'Sun, 20 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'EVM Chains: What Is the Ethereum Virtual Machine? - DailyCoin', 'content': 'EVM Chains are the bread and butter of the crypto space. In select cryptocurrency camps, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is considered a non-negotiable feature that emerging blockchains need to support to stay relevant and attract users.\n\nIf you sort the industry‚Äôs blockchains by TVL (Total Value Locked), 9 of the top 10 networks are EVM-compatible, with Solana (SOL) being the only exception to the rule.\n\nWhat exactly is the Ethereum Virtual Machine, and why is it so important?\n\nWhat Is the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)?\n\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine is a software environment that executes code and contracts on EVM networks. An easier way to think of it is to imagine a computer‚Äôs operating system. Regardless of whether you use an HP or Lenovo laptop, it‚Äôs easy to jump between the two because you‚Äôre ultimately communicating with the device through a Windows operating system.\n\nLet‚Äôs apply this concept to the world of blockchain technology. The Ethereum Virtual Machine means that whether you‚Äôre using Ethereum (ETH) or Polygon (MATIC), things look and feel more or less the same. For example, you don‚Äôt need to memorize the Arbitrum (ARB) whitepaper to use crypto wallets like MetaMask or a dex like Uniswap on the Arbitrum network.\n\nIf you‚Äôre confident using one EVM Chain, you‚Äôre confident using all of them.\n\nHow Does the Ethereum Virtual Machine Work?\n\nWhen you look closely at the EVM, you‚Äôll find a complex system that runs tasks consistently. The Ethereum Virtual Machine is deterministic, meaning if you give it a specific task, it will always give the same result, no matter where it‚Äôs done or who does it.\n\nThis deterministic nature is crucial for the consensus mechanism of the EVM-based networks, ensuring all nodes harmoniously agree on the state of the blockchain.\n\nThe EVM operates on a unique set of instructions, allowing for the creation, deployment, and execution of smart contracts. These contracts, written primarily in a programming language called Solidity, are then compiled into bytecode. This bytecode is what the EVM reads, interprets, and executes.\n\nWhen you initiate a smart contract transaction, the EVM springs into action. It processes the transaction, calculates the necessary gas fees, and updates the blockchain‚Äôs state.\n\nAnother intriguing facet of the EVM is its Turing completeness, meaning it can perform any calculation that any other programmable computer can, provided it‚Äôs given enough time and memory.\n\nHow does this benefit the Ethereum blockchain? Well, it means that the EVM can execute any algorithm or program, granting Ethereum its iconic flexibility. This versatility helps developers create innovative smart contracts and Web 3 dApps (decentralized applications) on the Ethereum mainnet and other EVM chains.\n\nWhy Is EVM Compatibility so Important?\n\nIn an industry fraught with interoperability issues and complex bridging processes, EVM chains help to smooth the onboarding process and give users a sense of trust and familiarity with new networks.\n\nEVM compatibility means that a blockchain can run the EVM and execute Ethereum smart contracts. This makes it easy for blockchain developers to port over existing contracts and ERC-20 tokens to a cross-chain environment and deploy crucial dApps, like decentralized exchanges or NFT marketplaces.\n\nWith the rise of multiple blockchains, each with its unique strengths like faster transactions and lower transaction fees, the ability to communicate and interact between them is of paramount importance. EVM-compatible blockchains integrate more easily than non-EVM chains, enabling assets and data to flow between different chains.\n\nOn top of that, operating an EVM helps emerging chains leverage Ethereum‚Äôs existing tools and infrastructure. Being a pioneer in the smart contract space, Ethereum has a rich ecosystem of DApps. EVM compatibility allows other blockchains to tap into this established ecosystem, benefiting from tried-and-tested tools and services without reinventing the wheel.\n\nLooking at competing Layer-1 blockchains that don‚Äôt naturally support EVM compatibility, like Cardano (ADA), we see first-hand how difficult it is to onboard new users, especially in DeFi.\n\nDespite Cardano having powerful tech in its own right, the network struggles to attract a user base as large as EVM chains like the BSC, Polygon, and Arbitrum. Cardano developers need to be proficient in the network‚Äôs dedicated programming language, Haskell, while all EVM chains use the same languages, like Solidity and Vyper.\n\nWhat‚Äôs the Difference Between EVM-Equivalence and EVM-Compatibility?\n\nJust when you thought you‚Äôd understood everything, there‚Äôs another layer of definitions. In today‚Äôs rapidly evolving industry, some blockchain ecosystems insist that simply being EVM-compatible is no longer enough. Teams like Polygon aim for EVM equivalence within the Polygon Proof-of-Stake sidechain and zkEVM.\n\nIs there any difference between compatibility and equivalence?\n\nEVM-Compatibility\n\nE...'}]

ETH price is expected to drop sharply if it brokes through the $1,600‚Äì$1,550 level.\n\nThe monthly average of Ethereum ($ETH) addresses that are currently active is lower than the annual average, indicating little on-chain activity.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap , at the time of writing, ETH was trading at $1,667.56, that represents a 0.36% fall over the last 24 hours.'}, {'id': 7, 'time': 'Mon, 21 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Why Did Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin Send $1M Worth of Ether to Coinbase? - CoinDesk', 'content': "Vital has moved some Ethereum about a $1 million worth Ethereum to coin base. What does this mean? Well, might indicate that he's willing to sell a little bit. He moved about 600 to coin base over the weekend. Vitals, public addresses for his Ethereum holdings are out there. Most people know where they are. They're visible on most uh either scans or like Blockchain explorers out there. And for good reason, right? He's probably the most central figure head in all crypto because he's uh the front man or the image of Ethereum ecosystem, which is the largest smart contract ecosystem and the second largest coin by market cap behind Bitcoin. So when people see vital or anyone else moving money uh with that big of a name out there, they start paying attention. Of course, we don't know if he sold this Ethereum and we also don't know the reasons behind it. Maybe he just wanted to get some more cushion for uh his US D bank account. Who knows Zach? I'll throw this one up to you. I don't look at this story and be like, oh, this is like a, a big ominous bad dark cloud story. I just think our boy is, you know, he's traveling all over around the world, he needs some money. Hey, man, I'm with you. I think big picture like this is the funny thing about crypto, right? You get to watch this stuff happen, you just get to see it. You're like, oh we know that this is a wallet associative of tal and you know, he chose to keep that in the public domain essentially. And now we can sort of see the the flows of money across uh the world into these exchange addresses, right? So it is just kind of a funny feature of crypto and I never, it never, it never gets dull to me that we can have these conversations based on, on chain activity and unchain activity alone, right? We don't know his intent. We don't know why we don't know what's, what's happening. We just know that we can watch this thing move from point A to point B and deduce, maybe that there's something uh animating that, right? And I think that's a really funny feature of crypto that we can talk about these things. Um without any other knowledge, aside from the fact that we just know one wallet interacted with another, and therefore we know this one happens to be vital and we can speculate on whatever the million dollars is gonna be for if it's for, you know, I don't know, getting more travel luggage. So he can go to different places around the world or not. But, yeah, I don't know. There's not much to say here. I don't know, is gonna, like, change people's price project like projections for Ethereum. Right? Or if it change, I don't think this indicates that like, vital is any less bullish on his creation. But it is just kind of a funny thing. Um, least blotter section of like Ethereum Daily News that you can, uh, I don't know, read with your morning coffee. Well, I say really quick before I hand it over to Wendy. Uh, the funny part about this is the Ethereum Foundation, which of course is a steward of a lot that happens in Ethereum does sell the top almost every single cycle. They have like successfully sold the top on Eth and they put that money back into the Treasury to support grants for Ethereum ecosystem. So it ends up, I think being a net positive. But a lot of people look at when the Ethereum Foundation sells and then sort of make a note about that. And this one, people, obviously not at the top. We're down about, you know, 50 plus percent from the top in 2021 2022. But people might be looking at this and be like, oh, maybe we're looking at like another lower point in the future. If Italic is selling Wendy, it's a one, it's one, literally $1 million. It's really not a lot of money, especially when you're looking at Crypto Whale Wall. It's like there's so many people that are moving around a lot more capital that are loaning it out doing things. I also want to reference a story from coin desk back in March or excuse me, May 17th of 2021 vital 6 billion in ship token says he doesn't want the power so vital has kind of been infamous of doing different things with his funds and wallets that have been tracked. So I don't think it's necessarily a big deal that he moved 1 million of worth to coin base. I think if it was going to be a very, very large amount, it probably would be done. OTC. Um but maybe he just wanted the, hey, maybe he wanted to bridge the funds over to base or to um friend who knows, who knows? Yeah, Wendy, this isn't the first time Vital has sold either. So I don't think this is gonna like do anything to the markets, but I wanted to ask all of you a question based on what said, what do we think if, if vital does cash out a million dollars here, what do we think he's gonna buy? What luxury luggage does vital buy. I love his luggage post. That's one of the better blogs out there is how vital lives out of a 40 liter backpack and here's how he does it. That one is a good piece of content. A lot of 40 liter backpacks. If we're talking a million dollars, I don't t..."}]

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn a concerning turn of events, Ethereum (ETH), the cornerstone of the crypto market, is teetering on the edge of a scenario reminiscent of 2019, ringing alarm bells among the investor community. Diving deep into the charts, renowned crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen has surfaced with a noteworthy insight that raises concerns for the altcoin giant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe crux of the matter lies in ETH's breach of the dynamic support line, signified by the Bull Market Support Band indicator. This echoes a pattern last witnessed over four years ago. Back then, Ethereum suffered a pivotal level loss, paving the way for a tumultuous six-month journey where its value plummeted by a staggering 48%, only finding reprieve by the close of December 2019.\n\nIn 2019, #ETH fell below its Bull Market Support Band in July/August, just as it has in 2023. pic.twitter.com/36v6BEDch1 ‚Äî Benjamin Cowen (@intocryptoverse) August 22, 2023\n\nWith history appearing to echo itself, the stakes are high for ETH's journey through the remainder of this year and the advent of 2024. An unsettling projection arises from Cowen's analysis, spotlighting the potential for Ethereum to slide toward the $900 mark per token.\n\nConvergence of perspectives\n\nNotably, Cowen is not the sole voice predicting such an outcome. Just a day prior, crypto analyst Ali Martinez , renowned in his own right, also foresaw a comparable fate for Ethereum based on meticulous technical analysis. Martinez articulated that Ethereum's fall beneath the $1,600-$1,550 range could lay the groundwork for a substantial correction ranging from 37% to 45%, ultimately targeting the $1,000 mark.\n\nAs the situation continues to evolve, it is increasingly evident that dark clouds are amassing over Ethereum, casting a shadow of uncertainty not only on the altcoin itself but also on the broader crypto market."}, {'id': 1, 'time': 'Tue, 22 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum Price Key Indicators Suggest Rising Selling Interest Below $1,700 - NewsBTC', 'content': 'Ethereum price is struggling to recover above the $1,700 resistance against the US Dollar.

ETH managed to recover above the $1,550 and $1,580 levels, similar to Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, the price is struggling to recover above the $1,700 and $1,720 levels.

This was the case as the blockchain‚Äôs monthly average active addresses dropped.\n\nThe monthly average of active ETH addresses stood lower than the yearly average. This clearly indicated low activity, which could be taken as a bearish signal. While the blockchain‚Äôs network activity declined, its price also failed to shoot up.\n\nIs Ethereum‚Äôs reluctance to push its price up a consequence of less network activity?\n\nRead Ethereum‚Äôs [ETH] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nThe reason for ETH‚Äôs price drop\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, ETH was down by more than 9% in the last seven days, reflecting its sluggish behavior. At the time of writing, it was trading at $1,670.05 with a market capitalization of over $200 billion.\n\nThe price drop had a major impact on investors‚Äô portfolios. As per Glassnode Alerts‚Äô tweet, the number of ETH addresses in loss reached a seven-month high of 42,602,870.333.\n\nHowever, upon taking a closer look, the reason behind the downtrend might not have been less network activity. This was because while ETH‚Äôs active addresses dropped, Layer-2s like Base, Optimism [OP], and rollups gained popularity.\n\nThe primary reason behind market participants shifting to L2s was that they offered more scalability. For reference, Coinbase‚Äôs L2 Base bridged $251 million, with ETH accounting for $155 million out of the total within days of launch.\n\nA closer look at Ethereum‚Äôs state\n\nA look at Ethereum‚Äôs on-chain performance gave a better understanding of what was going on in the ecosystem. Upon checking, it was revealed that investors in funds and trusts, including Grayscale, have relatively weak buying sentiment.\n\nAdditionally, as per CryptoQuant, ETH‚Äôs net deposit on exchanges was high compared to the seven-day average, suggesting high selling pressure. However, it was interesting to see that when ETH fell victim to the latest price correction, investors took it as an opportunity to increase accumulation.\n\nThis was evident from Glassnode Alerts‚Äô tweet, which pointed out that Ethereum‚Äôs exchange outflow volume reached a one-month high during that period.\n\n? #Ethereum $ETH Exchange Outflow Volume (7d MA) just reached a 1-month high of 9,627.006 ETH Previous 1-month high of 9,608.990 ETH was observed on 20 August 2023 View metric:https://t.co/LzFffVHu6i pic.twitter.com/dhJIEP4CZO ‚Äî glassnode alerts (@glassnodealerts) August 21, 2023\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today\n\nNot only metrics, but a few market indicators were also bearish. For example, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) displayed a bullish edge in the market.\n\nFurthermore, ETH‚Äôs Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also registered a downtick, increasing the chances of a price decline. Nonetheless, the Money Flow Index (MFI) rebounded from the oversold zone, which can help the token increase its price.'}, {'id': 6, 'time': 'Tue, 22 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "How EY's Brody Thinks Businesses Should Use Ethereum - Bloomberg", 'content': "00:00\n\nPaul, I want to first get your take on the FCC case, maybe not as as a judge, but just as someone who watches crypto. How important was it that Ripple won at least part of that case? So I think it was actually pretty important because any step forward towards clarity is a positive step. And I think if you look at the draft legislation that's coming from Congress, it's very, very reasonable. And so all of these things, I hope, are converging towards pressure towards we should have more clarity of rules. And I think what Meltem said in your introduction was fantastic. She's right on target. Clarity is good for business. And hopefully between the legal decisions and the pending legislation, we're getting there in one small step at a time. Okay. So as we talk about the pending decisions around what is and is not a security, also all waiting with bated breath each and every day to see if a spot ETF approval actually may come or grayscale may actually have its ruling come down in the D.C. Circuit Court. Didn't happen today. We'll see if it happens on Friday. So we'll all wait for that. In regard to futures, though, and that potential ETF, that one seems like it it maybe is more likely. What real difference would that make, Paul? So I think it would make an enormous difference because we're really starting and your prior guest was amazing on this topic. We're really starting to see the difference between Bitcoin, which is a kind of digital gold, and people want to see it as potentially an inflation hedge or a global asset versus Etherium, which is becoming a global computing infrastructure. And so by having ETF for the two separate ones and specifically having Etherium ETFs, you can start to sort of take a stake in the Etherium ecosystem in the cash flow of transactions, in the value of the overall asset infrastructure that's being built there. And for people to see these two properly as separate. I think it's really important for the development of the overall marketplace. Okay. So on the subject of Etherium, you are a somewhat expert on the subject. You actually just wrote a book that was released earlier this summer, Etherium for business. It's called A Plain English Guide to How to use cases that generate returns from asset as asset management to payments to supply chains. Paul How should businesses be thinking about using this technology? So we have a very simple thing at UI, which is that we believe blockchains are going to be the glue that tie business ecosystems together. And even though everyone tends to focus on finance and DEFI and SEC rulings, in fact, Etherium is an incredible infrastructure for tokenizing assets tracking supply chains. If we look at the kind of things that we talk, I talk about in the book and that we're doing it why they are tokenizing carbon offsets, tokenizing carbon traceability, tracking pharmaceuticals, managing procurement agreements. Right. There's a tremendous amount of operational business stuff, none of which is finance related, but is essential for how companies interact with each other. And Etherium provides a neutral, decentralized infrastructure in which enterprises can transact with each other on a level equal terms. On the subject of things being level, is this a zero sum game, Paul? Are we going to head into a world where one chain actually is dominant? Etherium Perhaps. So I do believe that. I think if you look historically at the world of computing infrastructure, we like standards, right? Basically, a single operating system represents 90% of all PCs. Two operating systems represent more than 95% of all phones. We like standard standard scale really well. So I think we are headed for a global infrastructure where Etherium is the global base layer standard for digital business transactions in the same way that TCP IP is a global network standard and that others over time will gradually wither away. Just like 20 or 30 years ago, we used to have an alphabet soup of different networking standards and now we just have TCP IP. That reminds me that I love the metric system. Paul And we're kind of nowhere there in the US. Are we going to face a similar disadvantage when it comes to the global blockchain? I mean, is the US regulating itself out of competition here or not regulating itself into competition? I worry that there is some risk of that happening. I just actually got back from four weeks in Asia and it's very clear Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore and additionally Europe and the Middle East. These are all places that are moving really forward. If we look at kind of our volume of work and deals, we're up in every sector and we're up in every geography. But the places that are growing the fastest by by far in terms of our blockchain and core crypto work are Europe in preparation for the MICA Assets law and Hong Kong, which is growing rapidly at us as China tries to reopen, and then obviously Dubai in the Middle East where the regulatory environment is maturing ve..."}]

"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain, news, and reflection analyst reports, it is clear that the overall sentiment is bullish for the ETH market. The on-chain data indicates positive momentum with increasing total value transferred, successful transactions, and unique addresses. The news report highlights continued support for the Ethereum ecosystem, innovative projects like BabyShiba, and the platform's resilience in the face of market challenges. The reflection report emphasizes the importance of a balanced and moderately conservative trading approach to navigate the volatile market effectively.

Considering the positive indicators from both on-chain data and news sentiment, it is likely that the ETH market will continue to see a bullish trend in the near future. However, to maximize long-term profitability and manage risks effectively, it is important to prioritize a moderately conservative trading strategy over short-term gains.

Therefore, I would take a trading action with a confidence level of 0.7, indicating a moderately bullish stance on the ETH market. This decision reflects a strategic approach to capitalize on the potential upside while being mindful of the inherent risks in cryptocurrency trading.

After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market has shown positive signs of potential growth, with stable transaction activity, low gas prices, and a buy trend indicated by the MACD signal. The news analyst report highlights both positive and negative developments in the cryptocurrency market, with concerns over regulatory uncertainties and whale activity, but also showcasing the strong ecosystem of Ethereum Layer-2 Arbitrum. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a balanced and moderately conservative trading approach to maximize long-term profitability and manage risks effectively.

Synthesizing the reports, it is evident that while short-term price movements may be influenced by external factors, the long-term growth potential of Ethereum and its ecosystem remains promising. Therefore, it is advisable to prioritize a long-term strategy over short-term gains to navigate the volatile market successfully.

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the overall market trend for ETH is bullish, with a consistent increase in open price and high total value transferred indicating continued interest in the market. The MACD signal at a buy level further supports a positive market trend. However, the fluctuating gas prices could impact transaction costs and potentially affect market sentiment.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights potential volatility in the ETH market due to Vitalik Buterin's transfer of $1 million worth of ETH to Coinbase, market corrections, and high Layer 2 activity. These factors could lead to increased price declines in the near term.

In reflection, a balanced approach considering both on-chain data and news sentiment has been effective in making informed trading decisions. Prioritizing long-term profitability and risk management over short-term gains is crucial in navigating the current cryptocurrency market successfully.

Considering the synthesized reports, the market trend for ETH appears to be positive in the long term despite potential short-term volatility. Therefore, a moderately conservative trading approach is warranted to capitalize on potential growth opportunities while managing risks effectively.

Based on the analysis, I would take a trading action with a confidence level of 0.5, indicating a neutral stance in the current market conditions. This decision reflects a balanced approach to maximize overall profit while mitigating potential risks in the volatile cryptocurrency market.

With the move, the U.S. joins other countries where Bitstamp staking services aren\'t available, including Canada, Japan, Singapore and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe decision appears to be related to recent legal developments in the United States.

Optimistic rollups are ‚Äúoptimistic‚Äù in nature as they assume transactions are valid until proven otherwise.\n\nMost rollups today only have one single sequencer, meaning there is a centralization risk, Anurag Arjun, co-founder of modular blockchain Avail, told Blockworks.\n\nThis is not a major problem at present, as rollup solutions must put the raw transaction data on Ethereum using something called calldata ‚Äî the cheapest form of storage on Ethereum today, as Arjun notes.\n\nOnce a calldata is submitted to Ethereum mainnet, anyone can challenge whether or not it is accurate within a set period of time, according to Neel Somani, the founder of blockchain scaling solution Eclipse.\n\nIf no one challenges the validity of the rollup, it will be accepted on Ethereum once the period of time is up.\n\nThe problem, Somani notes, is how someone can then prove that a transaction was executed inaccurately if they don‚Äôt have the data.\n\n‚ÄúIf I don‚Äôt tell you what I executed, there‚Äôs no way for you to possibly prove that it is wrong, so you need to know exactly what I executed in order to fix that,‚Äù Somani said. ‚ÄúSo all blockchains must prove data availability in some way, shape or form.‚Äù\n\nData availability sampling\n\nAs all blockchains must prove data availability, it can be inefficient to download a full block onto a network, which again invokes the initial data availability problem.\n\n‚ÄúSo as someone who doesn‚Äôt want to download the full block, I still want the confidence that the information on the block is not being withheld,‚Äù Somani said.\n\nThe solution, according to Somani, is the use of data availability sampling to gain confidence that the block is actually there.\n\nData availability sampling involves sampling random parts of the block to obtain arbitrarily high confidence that the block is there, Somani explains.\n\nThis technology utilizes polynomials ‚Äî a mathematical expression comprising variables, coefficients and exponentiation ‚Äî to model relationships between variables in a block.\n\nA common misinterpretation of data availability sampling is that if you sample half the block, you only gain 50% confidence that the information in the block is accurate, Somani said. This isn‚Äôt true, he explains, because as with data availability sampling, users must make sure that they have enough points to recover the original polynomial.\n\nProjects like Celestia and Avail are currently building out data availability sampling solutions.\n\n‚ÄúWhat we sincerely believe is that every base layer is going to be a data availability layer,‚Äù Arjun told Blockworks. ‚ÄúThe main directional fight that we are having is wanting to scale data availability at the base layer, and have execution and roll up on the second layer.‚Äù\n\nDon‚Äôt miss the next big story ‚Äì join our free daily newsletter.'}]

"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the overall market trend for ETH is bullish, with a consistent increase in open price and high total value transferred indicating continued interest in the market. The MACD signal at a buy level further supports a positive market trend. However, the fluctuating gas prices could impact transaction costs and potentially affect market sentiment.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights potential volatility in the ETH market due to Vitalik Buterin's transfer of $1 million worth of ETH to Coinbase, market corrections, and high Layer 2 activity. These factors could lead to increased price declines in the near term.

In reflection, a balanced approach considering both on-chain data and news sentiment has been effective in making informed trading decisions. Prioritizing long-term profitability and risk management over short-term gains is crucial in navigating the current cryptocurrency market successfully.

Considering the synthesized reports, the market trend for ETH appears to be positive in the long term despite potential short-term volatility. Therefore, a moderately conservative trading approach is warranted to capitalize on potential growth opportunities while managing risks effectively.

Based on the analysis, I would take a trading action with a confidence level of 0.5, indicating a neutral stance in the current market conditions. This decision reflects a balanced approach to maximize overall profit while mitigating potential risks in the volatile cryptocurrency market.

Taking into account the reflection analyst report, which emphasizes a balanced and moderately conservative approach to trading, it is important to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains. While short-term volatility and potential downward pressure on ETH's price are highlighted, the positive indicators in the on-chain data suggest a more optimistic long-term outlook for ETH.

As more of the circulating supply gets locked up in staking, one particular metric is experiencing a decline.\n\nIs your portfolio green?

As of this writing, nearly 28 million ETH were staked, in sharp contrast to the approximately 16 million ETH staked in January. This signified a substantial increase in staking volume.\n\nAccording to CryptoMarketCap, the total circulating supply of ETH had surpassed 120 million as of this writing. Additionally, data from Dune Analytics revealed that the staked portion constituted more than 21.8% of the total supply, implying that nearly 22% of the entire ETH supply was staked at press time.\n\nConsidering the daily staking rate, this proportion is anticipated to rise further.

Nonetheless, this metric has undergone a substantial reduction in recent months.\n\nAs of this writing, the percentage of the circulating supply residing on exchanges hovered around 8.5%. Also, this shift signified a decrease from the January figure of over 13 million to approximately 10.7 million on exchanges.\n\nAdditionally, this reflected a scenario where an increasing number of holders were inclined to stake their ETH.

Source: a video screenshot, Lex Fridman / YouTube\n\nEthereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin has said he is ‚Äúdefinitely‚Äù worried about centralization risks following The Merge, the event when the current Ethereum Mainnet merges with the beacon chain proof-of-stake (PoS) system.\n\nThe Ethereum mastermind noted that Lido Finance, the largest provider of staking services for Ethereum, where around a third of staked ETH (stETH) has been deposited, could theoretically disturb the Ethereum network post-Merge.\n\n‚ÄúBut I also think it‚Äôs important to not overly catastrophize the issue,‚Äù he added.\n\n‚ÄúFirst of all, if you have a third [of staked Ether deposits on the Beacon chain], you can‚Äôt revert the chain or whatever,‚Äù Buterin said in an interview with Fortune, adding:\n\n‚ÄúBut realistically, the worst that you could do is make finality stop happening for about a day or so, which is inconvenient, but it‚Äôs not that terrible.‚Äù\n\nButerin also mentioned that Lido does not act as a single entity but that ‚Äúthey have something like 21 delegates and nodes that are running these validators that are inside of Lido,‚Äù he said, claiming that ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a lot of good decentralization between them.‚Äù\n\nLido is the largest provider of staking services for Ethereum. Generally, users who want to become Ethereum 2.0 validators and earn rewards need to stake a minimum of ETH 32, which is a high price.\n\nHowever, Lido enables users to pool their ETH and participate in staking even if they don‚Äôt have the required ETH 32. The protocol distributes stETH tokens to users in return for their staked coins, which can be redeemed for ETH in the future or traded for other coins.\n\nThe Merge is Ethereum‚Äôs long-anticipated update expected to happen by the end of the year.\n\nThe upgrade has several benefits, Buterin said, noting that it makes Ethereum more environmentally friendly compared to the current proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism. According to last year‚Äôs estimate by a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, this upgrade can cut the energy used by the Ethereum network by at least 99.95%.\n\n‚ÄúAlso, proof of stake can increase the safety of the system. It makes it more expensive to attack,‚Äù Buterin told Fortune. ‚ÄúIt makes it easier to recover from an attack, which is something people don‚Äôt think about.‚Äù\n\nAnother benefit is that PoS is more censorship-resistant. That is because, Buterin says, ‚Äúminers are easier to detect and easier to shut down than just computers that are running validator nodes.‚Äù\n\nMeanwhile, at 10:33 UTC, ETH is trading at USD 1,156, up by 3% over the past 24 hours and down 4% over the past 7 days.

These regulations are designed to provide investors with access to relevant information about investments before and after investing, and to prevent conflicts of interest in the securities industry.\n\nDefinition Of Securities\n\nSecurities are fungible and tradable financial instruments to raise capital in both the public and private markets. Securities can include notes, stocks, bonds, certificates of interest, collateral trust certificates, and more. These instruments then serve as a means for individuals and entities to invest, speculate, and manage risk within the financial markets.\n\nThe term ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù covers a broad range of investments, and its definition can vary based on jurisdiction and context. Securities play a pivotal role in capital markets, enabling companies and governments to access funding while offering investors opportunities for potential returns and income.\n\nWhat Is The Howey Test? Explanation Of The Howey Test\n\nThe SEC is a U.S. government oversight agency responsible for regulating the securities markets and safeguarding investors. The SEC‚Äôs jurisdiction extends to various aspects of financial markets, including investment banks, trading, financial dealings, product offerings, advertising, and fiduciary responsibilities.\n\nThe Howey Test is a legal framework used in the United States to determine whether a transaction qualifies as an investment contract and thus falls under securities regulations. The test originates from the landmark Supreme Court case SEC v. W.J. Howey Co in 1946.\n\nThe test consists of three main elements:\n\nAn investment of money,\n\nIn a common enterprise,\n\nWith an expectation of profits primarily from the efforts of others.\n\nIf these three elements are met, the transaction is considered a security, subject to the regulations set forth by SEC. The Howey Test serves as a fundamental guideline for classifying various financial arrangements and offerings in terms of whether they require compliance with securities laws and regulations, ensuring investor protection and transparency in financial markets.\n\nEthereum‚Äôs Characteristics And SEC‚Äôs Perspective On Ethereum\n\nEthereum is a decentralized blockchain platform known for its programmable smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). It enables developers to build and deploy decentralized applications on its network, offering features like transparency, immutability, and trustlessness. Ethereum‚Äôs native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), is used for transactions and to incentivize network participants.\n\nThe U.S. SEC has indicated that whether a particular cryptocurrency, like Ether, constitutes a security depends on its specific characteristics and how it is marketed and sold. The SEC has noted that if a cryptocurrency operates as a security , it falls under its regulatory jurisdiction, subject to applicable securities laws. The classification of cryptocurrencies like Ethereum is based on the Howey Test and other legal considerations to determine their status as securities or commodities, impacting their regulatory oversight and legal compliance.\n\nSEC‚Äôs Statements and Actions Regarding Cryptocurrencies And Tokens\n\nThe U.S. SEC has actively engaged with the evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies and tokens through its statements and actions. The SEC‚Äôs emphasis on investor protection and market integrity has led to a series of public statements clarifying its position on digital assets. It has consistently emphasized that whether a particular cryptocurrency or token qualifies as a security de...'}]

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that there are positive trends in the open price of ETH, total transactions, gas usage, and other key indicators. The MACD signal also suggests a bullish market trend for ETH, indicating a potential upward movement in the near future. On the other hand, the news analyst report paints a bearish picture for ETH, citing struggles to break above resistance levels and a negative sentiment in the market.

Taking into account the reflection analyst report, which emphasizes a balanced and moderately conservative approach to trading, it is important to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains. While short-term volatility and potential downward pressure on ETH's price are highlighted, the positive indicators in the on-chain data suggest a more optimistic long-term outlook for ETH.

Considering all the reports, it is advisable to maintain a cautious approach and focus on long-term profitability. Therefore, my trading action would be to buy ETH with a confidence level of 0.5, indicating a moderate belief in the potential upward trend while also acknowledging the short-term risks in the market.

Its price is currently down by around 65% from its peak in late 2021, while Cardano has fallen by a staggering 87% in that time, and Solana has plummeted by around 91%.\n\nFor long-term investors who stuck it out through the rough patches, Ethereum has been a lucrative investment. Here's how much $100 of Ethereum would be worth today, depending on when you'd invested:\n\nDate Invested Ethereum Returns as of Today How Much $100 Would Be Worth Today Aug. 1, 2021 -30% $70 Aug. 1, 2020 333% $433 Aug. 1, 2019 671% $771\n\nThe short term can be rocky for crypto, and if you'd invested in late 2021 right before prices plummeted, your investment would have declined in value. But if you'd invested just four years ago and held through all the ups and downs, you'd have nearly 8 times your initial investment by today.\n\nIs Ethereum a good investment right now?\n\nAgain, past performance doesn't predict future returns. There are never any guarantees when investing, and this is especially true with crypto due to its speculative nature. No one can say, then, whether Ethereum will continue on its track of explosive long-term returns.\n\nThat said, Ethereum is one of the strongest players in the crypto space, and it has a slew of advantages. Its sheer size is one of them, as it's far and away the most popular network for decentralized applications -- such as NFT marketplaces, DeFi projects, and metaverse apps.\n\nEthereum's developers are also committed to consistently upgrading the blockchain to make it stronger and more useful. Last year, they successfully pulled off The Merge -- a landmark upgrade that moved Ethereum from the energy-intensive proof-of-work system to the far more efficient proof-of-stake model.\n\nThe Surge is one of the next eagerly awaited updates, and it aims to improve the network's speed and reduce transaction fees. These have long been two major pain points for Ethereum, and if developers are able to successfully pull off this update, it could be a game-changer.\n\nDownsides to consider before you buy\n\nWhile Ethereum has plenty of advantages, it won't be right for every portfolio.\n\nLike the crypto industry in general, Ethereum is still a speculative investment. Although it does have a fair amount of utility (especially compared to many of its competitors), its primary uses are also somewhat speculative right now. If NFTs, DeFi, or the metaverse become more mainstream, for instance, Ethereum could thrive. But if they never catch on, it could spell trouble.\n\nMuch of Ethereum's future success also hinges on its upcoming upgrades. If those updates take longer than expected to complete or there are significant hiccups during the rollouts, that could shake users' confidence -- and provide an opportunity for competitors to swoop in and grab market share.\n\nIn short, Ethereum is still speculative, but it's also one of the strongest investments in the crypto space right now. If you're willing to take on more risk for the chance to earn potentially lucrative returns over the long run, it may be a smart addition to your portfolio."}]

The news articles suggest a positive outlook for Cardano (ADA) as Charles Hoskinson predicts that it will surpass Bitcoin and Ethereum to become the world's largest cryptocurrency due to its governance model and decentralization. Despite ADA's current downward trend, the recent Alonzo upgrade and potential market reach are seen as drivers for its growth. On the other hand, concerns arise for Ethereum (ETH) as data shows that the top 10 addresses control over 35% of the total supply, sparking centralization concerns. However, the increase in wallets holding ETH and whale transactions indicate ongoing interest in the cryptocurrency. Overall, the market trend for Cardano appears bullish, while Ethereum may face challenges related to centralization concerns.

As part of its capital ventures, the company has invested in Ethereum, the world‚Äôs second-largest cryptocurrency, per an Evening Standard report. This move comes as the firm celebrates a milestone, with revenues surpassing $1 billion for the first time in 2022.\n\nEthereum and the Future of Digital Investments\n\nEthereum price is currently trading at $1,643.71 and boasting a 24-hour trading volume of $2,693,591,545, remains an attractive investment for many businesses, with OnlyFans being the latest to explore its potential.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe capital infusion into Ethereum suggests a forward-thinking strategy on OnlyFans‚Äô part, indicating a shift towards diversifying assets and possibly integrating blockchain technology or cryptocurrency-based models into its operations. With a circulating supply of 120,216,173 ETH coins and the max supply undisclosed, Ethereum presents promising returns for early adopters.\n\nGrowth Amidst Controversy\n\nIt‚Äôs worth noting that OnlyFans has witnessed remarkable growth in the past year. According to the Evening Standard, the platform reported a 17% increase in sales, settling at $1.1 billion, and an impressive jump of 21% in pre-tax profits, which stands at $525 million. Over 50 million new users, accompanied by 1 million fresh content creators, flocked to the platform, cumulatively spending $5.5 billion on the site.\n\nHowever, the firm hasn‚Äôt been without its challenges. A BBC News investigation last year uncovered incidents of underage individuals selling and appearing in videos on the platform, sparking safety concerns. In response to these allegations, OnlyFans defended its safety protocols, stating in its accounts that the company ‚Äúgoes above and beyond the legal requirements‚Äù to ensure a safe and controlled environment for its community.'}, {'id': 9, 'time': 'Sun, 27 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "OnlyFans' Ethereum Holdings Sank‚ÄîBut 2022 Was Still A Good Year - Decrypt", 'content': 'Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt‚Äôs Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub.

Maybe not so much.\n\nOver the weekend, Crypto Twitter zeroed in on a financial statement submitted by OnlyFans‚Äô parent company Fenix International Limited to British authorities on Thursday. It showed that the company had owned over $19 million in Ether (ETH), Ethereum‚Äôs native token, but its value was slashed to about $11.4 million by the end of the reporting period in November 2022.\n\n‚ÄúDuring this year, the group diversified part of its working capital into a cryptocurrency asset‚ÄîETH or Ethereum,‚Äù the company said in a strategic statement that opens the 48-page document. ‚ÄúThere are no limitations or restrictions on the group\'s ability to sell the cryptocurrency assets. The asset has been impaired to its fair value at the year end."\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLast year, OnlyFans‚Äîinfamous for the many adult performers hosted on the platform‚Äîmade a splash in the crypto space by announcing that creators could use verified Ethereum NFTs in their profile images. Creators who did so received an Ethereum symbol to show their ownership of the asset.\n\nAt the time, OnlyFans‚Äô CEO Amrapali Gan said the feature‚Äîsimilar to one introduced for Instagram and Facebook by Meta‚Äîaimed to "empower creators to own their full potential."\n\n"This feature is the first step in exploring the role that NFTs can play on our platform," Gan told Reuters.\n\nUnfortunately, the company could not have anticipated the crypto bear market lurking around the corner. At the time of the NFT announcement, ETH was trading at $2,797.43, but fell to $1,298.94 by November 30 when the reporting period ended. At the time of writing, ETH is trading at $1,645.90.\n\nImage: Coingecko\n\nLast year was a tumultuous one for cryptocurrency markets. It was marked by a cascade of failures including the collapse of Terra\'s UST stablecoin and governance token LUNA, the bankruptcy of crypto lender Celsius, and the implosion of cryptocurrency exchange FTX.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut apart from its ETH woes, OnlyFans enjoyed a positive 2022. According to the financial statement, the site saw the company\'s revenue shoot up to $5.6 billion from $4.8 billion in 2021.

He delivers high-quality engaging articles to Coinpedia through his in-depth research and analysis.\n\nIn the past week, Bitcoin has experienced significant price fluctuations within its consolidation range, influenced by various macroeconomic factors such as Jerome Powell‚Äôs address. As Bitcoin falls short of meeting the short-term bullish expectations of investors, capital is increasingly flowing into the altcoin sector. Looking ahead to the coming week, a substantial recovery rally in the altcoin market is anticipated, with Ethereum, Litecoin, and Shiba Inu potentially leading this rally.\n\nAltcoins On The Edge Of Recovery\n\nBitcoin‚Äôs price continues to flash volatility near $26K in response to Powell‚Äôs hawkish comments. This development is somewhat expected, considering the bearish trend Bitcoin had been exhibiting in the days leading up to the Jackson Hole symposium. Traders had been preparing for Powell‚Äôs ongoing moves on controlling the inflation to align with the central bank‚Äôs 2% target.\n\nAmid this, the prices of Ethereum, Litecoin, and Shiba Inu have been hovering near key support levels. With sellers unable to push prices further downward, a potential bounce-back from these support levels is anticipated for the coming week.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis\n\nEther‚Äôs price recently attempted to break above $1,700 but couldn‚Äôt maintain its position, indicating strong defense from the bears at this price point.\n\nThe declining moving averages and the RSI below the midline suggest that bearish momentum still dominates. Sellers are likely to aim for pushing the price into the $1,625 to $1,544 range. If successful, we could see a drop below the support channel, plunging the ETH price toward the $1,360 level.\n\nConversely, bulls aren‚Äôt leaving the field easily. They are expected to robustly defend the support zone and attempt to push the price above the 50-day EMA of $1,678. If they manage this, it would imply that the ETH price could continue to hover in a bullish range of $1,785-$1,863.\n\nLitecoin Price Analysis\n\nLitecoin has been trading within a narrow band of $60 to $67 over the last several days. While the bulls have managed to hold a decline below the $60 support level, they‚Äôve been unable to push past the $67 resistance.\n\nAn extended consolidation often leads to a solid breakout momentum ahead, and LTC price might experience that soon. If bulls successfully break above the consolidation next week, LTC price could initially target the 200-day EMA at $77 before aiming for the more ambitious $85 mark, where significant bearish activity is expected.\n\nConversely, it‚Äôs crucial for the bulls to defend the $60 support level. Failure to do so could trigger the next downward phase, potentially driving the price to $47.\n\nShiba Inu Price Analysis\n\nThe extended wick on SHIB‚Äôs candle pattern indicates that bearish traders are still active, selling off during upward movements.\n\nIf the price falls below the immediate support level of $0.000008, it would imply that the bears are still in control. In such a scenario, SHIB‚Äôs price could decline to a low of $0.0000077. A further drop below this point could lead to a retest of the long-standing support at $0.00000705.\n\nOn the other hand, a surge above EMA50 will strengthen bullish positions, sending the meme coin toward $0.00001.'}]

(Ethereum Price Analysis) - CryptoPotato', 'content': 'Following an unexpected and rapid drop from the $1.8K threshold, Ethereum‚Äôs price experienced a significant dip, falling below the critical 100-day and 200-day moving averages (MAs).\n\nThis development is considered a significant bearish sign for ETH. However, the price managed to find support within a crucial range, hinting at the possibility of an imminent consolidation phase.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nA close examination of the daily chart reveals that the price‚Äôs breach beneath the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, around $1,835 and $1,800 correspondingly, caused a marked downtrend that eventually landed Ethereum‚Äôs value within the pivotal support zone at $1.6K.\n\nIt‚Äôs important to note that the 200-day moving average holds substantial significance as an indicator of prevailing market trends. Traditionally, a bearish sentiment engulfs the market when the price remains below this MA.\n\nCurrently, the $1.6K support level has proven its resilience in upholding the price, indicating the potential for a recovery and subsequent pullback. However, the recent downtrend has shifted the market‚Äôs structure into a more bearish stance, thus enhancing the possibility of a retest of the $1,400 zone in the upcoming weeks.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nTurning attention to the 4-hour timeframe, it becomes evident that ETH lost the critical support point of $1.8K. This quick decline led the price to find support within the range of $1.5K, resulting in a temporary end of the prevailing downtrend.\n\nRemarkably, this support level has so far demonstrated its efficacy in maintaining the price, resulting in a period of sideways consolidation. As a consequence of this consolidation phase, Ethereum‚Äôs price movement has taken on the form of a roughly symmetrical triangle pattern. This technical pattern can develop into bullish and bearish signals depending on the direction in which the pattern‚Äôs breakout occurs.\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nEthereum‚Äôs price trajectory currently remains in a state of uncertainty, displaying no clear inclination towards an upward or downward movement. Consequently, as the price chart offers limited insights into forthcoming market trends, delving into the futures market sentiment might provide valuable insights into Ethereum‚Äôs current state.\n\nThe following chart illustrates Ethereum‚Äôs funding rates, a pivotal point for identifying the dominance between long traders and short sellers. Positive values align with a bullish outlook, while negative values signify a bearish stance.\n\nNotably, an apparent pattern emerges from the data. Following a sudden impulsive decline, succeeded by a consolidation phase with stagnant price action, the funding rates undertook a downward trend, forming lower peaks on the chart. This unfolding scenario hints at a lack of interest in going long in the futures market, potentially paving the way for a bearish trajectory.\n\nNonetheless, despite the prevailing bearish sentiment, there remains the possibility of a minor corrective phase preceding a more pronounced downward trend. Should the funding rates assume a negative stance, this could elevate the likelihood of a cascade of short liquidations, potentially leading to a substantial bullish rebound that propels the price upwards.'}]

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
The news articles suggest a mixed sentiment for Ethereum (ETH) in the market. While one article highlights a decrease in daily transaction fees and potential price decline below $1,620, another article mentions a major fund withdrawal from a crypto investment fund to purchase $10 million worth of ETH. Additionally, the disclosure of OnlyFans' parent company's $20 million investment in ETH and the positive growth in revenue indicate some bullish factors. Overall, the market trend for ETH appears uncertain with potential downside risks due to technical analysis pointing towards a possible retest of the $1,400 zone, but the influx of investments and fund activities could provide support for a bullish rebound in the near term.
