But as Bitcoin starts to regain inflow momentum, Solana has continued to shine, trumping altcoin investment products with inflows of $5 million.\n\nSolana Digital Investment Products Leaves Ethereum In The Dust\n\nSolana has been on an epic run this year and has done better than most altcoins in terms of interest from institutional investors. The crypto continues to reiterate its climbing position among investors with 27 weeks of inflows and just 4 weeks of outflows this year. But while altcoins like Solana and XRP have also had inflows in recent weeks, Ethereum, in particular, has struggled to gain momentum from institutions.\n\nCoinShares’ data reveals investor interest in Ethereum is rather low. Although Ethereum is still the dominant platform for DeFi and smart contracts, its investment products registered outflows of $1.5 million last week, taking its trend of outflows for the 6th consecutive week.\n\nOther altcoins like Litecoin, XRP, and Tron had no net inflows/outflows, but short Bitcoin and Multi-asset investment products also registered outflows of $1.5 million and $1.4 million, respectively.\n\nSOL price holds above $24 | Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nFactors Influencing The Inflow\n\nThe report from Coinshares attributes the inflows into Bitcoin to a reaction to a combination of positive price momentum and fears over US government debt prices, considering most of the inflow came in late in the week. Amid these influences, Solana has seen growth in other aspects of its ecosystem that may have attracted institutional investors.\n\nFor one, Solana has had one of the best TVL performances in recent months, overtaking Ethereum in terms of growth. Data from DefiLlama shows Solana’s total value locked just reached a new high from the year at $336.77 million. This represents a growth of 64% from its $205.11 million TVL at the beginning of the year.\n\nData from Coinmarketcap shows Solana has benefited the most from the ongoing bullish momentum in the wider crypto market. As a result, Solana managed to overtake Dogecoin and Cardano to become the seventh-largest crypto by market cap.\n\nAt the time of writing, Solana has increased by 24.13% in a 7-day timeframe. Solana’s current price action is approaching resistance at $24.5, which could force another downside correction.\n\nFeatured image from Guarda Wallet, chart from Tradingview.com'}, {'id': 4, 'time': 'Sat, 30 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Solana Outperforms 2 Top Altcoins – Its Ripple Effect On Prices - NewsBTC', 'content': 'Solana (SOL) has emerged as a standout performer in the recent crypto market rally, catching the attention of investors and analysts alike. The entire cryptocurrency market has been on a bullish streak, with most digital assets turning green on the charts. However, Solana has managed to stand out by achieving an unprecedented increase in its price.\n\nAt the time of writing, SOL was trading at $23.54 on CoinGecko and boasted a market capitalization near $10 billion. While the coin did register a 1.6% loss in the past 24 hours, its seven-day surge of 22% indicated its resilience and potential for further growth.\n\nIn fact, this remarkable price uptrend enabled Solana to surpass both Dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano (ADA), securing its position as the seventh-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nCrypto Era Looms: BIS Innovations Chief Calls On Central Banks To Prepare 7 months ago\n\nSolana’s Growth Drivers\n\nOne key factor behind Solana’s surge was its impressive 100%+ increase in 24-hour trading volume, providing robust support for its price appreciation. Additionally, Solana’s performance within the decentralized finance sector also experienced notable growth during this period.\n\nThe positive sentiment surrounding Solana was further evidenced by data from LunarCrush, which indicated a nearly 47% surge in SOL’s social engagement over the last seven days. Investors and enthusiasts were increasingly drawn to the coin as its price continued to rise.\n\nGearing Up For A Bull Market\n\nPseudonymous analyst Inmortal, active on the social media platform X, expressed optimism about Solana’s potential.

But you were too scared because FTX was going to dump their coins. — Inmortal (@inmortalcrypto) September 20, 2023\n\nAccording to Inmortal, those who accumulate SOL at its current price point are likely to be handsomely rewarded in the coming years. In a statement, Inmortal said, “In two years, you will realize that everything was as simple as buying SOL below $20 and waiting. But you were too scared because FTX was going to dump their coins.”\n\nSOL market cap approaches the $10 billion level. Chart: TradingView.com\n\nConcerns had arisen when court documents revealed that FTX owns approximately $1.16 billion worth of SOL. This led many traders to speculate that Solana’s price might face downward pressure if FTX were to liquidate its holdings.\n\nHowever, notable investor Chris Burniske pointed out that only a fraction of FTX’s SOL holdings are actually liquid, stating, “Only ~13% of FTX’s SOL holdings are liquid… Keep a cool head, folks.”\n\nRelated Reading\n\nAs Solana continues to gain traction in the crypto market, investors are closely watching its performance, with many betting on the coin’s long-term potential and the possibility of significant rewards for those who enter the market now.\n\nThe recent surge in Solana’s price and its positive developments in the DeFi space have solidified its position as a cryptocurrency to watch.\n\n(This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice.

Based on the on-chain analyst report, there is a high level of activity in the ETH market with a significant number of transactions. However, the MACD signal is indicating a sell trend, suggesting a potential downward trend in the near future. The news analyst report highlights the success of Solana and its bullish trend in the cryptocurrency market, attracting institutional investors and experiencing significant price growth. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of identifying key trends and indicators in the market to make informed decisions and adopting a more conservative trading approach to minimize risks.

Considering the reports, it is evident that while there is activity in the ETH market, the potential downward trend indicated by the MACD signal and the bullish trend of Solana suggest a mixed market sentiment. In such a volatile market, a long-term strategy focused on minimizing risks and protecting capital is crucial.

Therefore, I would take a cautious approach and decide to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.5. This decision reflects my acknowledgment of the potential downward trend in the near future and my strategic choice to manage risk appropriately in the current market conditions.

Don’t invest unless you’re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong. Investing in cryptocurrency and crypto assets is high risk. Don’t invest unless you’re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nOver the past several months, some of the major cryptocurrencies have cooled off a bit. But SOL, the native currency of the Solana blockchain, is a major exception. This relatively new coin experienced a massive run-up between the start of 2021 and the start of September. But this hot commodity isn’t without its troubles. On the 14th of September, the entire Solana Blockchain shut down for 17 hours after a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. That could prove that SOL was overhyped. Or it could indicate that the SOL coin is experiencing growing pains as it scales. If you’re interested in investing in SOL and the Solana Blockchain technology, here’s what you need to know.\n\nWhat Is The Solana Blockchain?\n\nThe Solana Blockchain is a technology that was created by the Solana Foundation. This organization uses open-source code to create and improve the blockchain.\n\n\n\nLike all blockchain technologies, the Solana Blockchain uses distributed ledger technology. That means that transactions on the blockchain are validated by “validators” in a way that keeps information distributed among different nodes instead of centralized.\n\n\n\nUnlike the oldest blockchain technologies, Solana uses the more updated approach called “staking.” In staking, validators offer proof of stake (basically, they prove they have SOL tokens) to keep the blockchain in operation. This allows the blockchain to function faster and with fewer energy costs than traditional mining technologies. The result, when it works, is an extremely fast blockchain with transaction costs under $0.01 on average.\n\n\n\nHowever, the staking method has some downsides. In a September 2021 DoS attack (basically, a bot fired tons of traffic toward the network), caused the network\'s validators to crash which subsequently knocked the blockchain offline for 17 hours.\n\nHow Is The Solana Blockchain Different From The SOL Token?\n\nThe Solana Blockchain is a fast, cheap, open-source technology that allows developers to build their blockchain technologies. Many of the apps that have been built so far are related to DeFi (Decentralized Finance), but others are NFTs, WB3s, and more. So far, Ethereum is still the leading blockchain in regard to the number of digital apps and smart contracts that have already been built. But Solana\'s speed and low transaction cost is attracting many developers. Solana says that its blockchain already has more than 400 blockchain projects and that it\'s the "fastest-growing ecosytem in crypto."\n\n\n\nThe Solana Token, SOL, is the “value” or the token that keeps the Solana Blockchain running. Since validators must offer up SOL as a proof-of-stake, the SOL token is a critical component to keeping the blockchain going.\n\nSOL Has Grown At A Rapid Pace\n\nWhen Solana was first launched in April of 2020, it traded at a rate of $0.78 per SOL. The token experienced steady growth through the remainder of 2020 and then started an exponential growth curve in 2021.\n\nOn September 7th, SOL traded for over $190 per SOL. The token has subsequently experienced wild mostly downward volatility and as of now is trading for $140.\n\n\n\nWhile SOL token’s wild volatility is nothing new in the world of cryptocurrency, the token itself has some interesting features. SOL’s crucial role in validating the Solana Blockchain gives owners a chance to invest in a specific blockchain instead of generically owning cryptocurrency.\n\nHow To Invest In Solana (SOL)\n\nAre You Too Late To Invest In Solana?\n\nGiven the run-up in SOL prices (as compared to USD), it’s worth considering whether you’re too late to invest in this hot coin. Some coins trade at far higher prices and have experienced wild growth for nearly a decade before cooling off (at least for the time). Still, others saw run-ups in price before crashing.\n\n\n\nIn the world of crypto, anything is possible. The unique relationship between SOL and the Solana blockchain makes it a cryptocurrency with a unique investment angle. But there’s no guarantee that the token will continue to increase in price. After all, the code operating the blockchain is open source and another company may copy it to produce something better.\n\nFinal Thoughts'}, {'id': 2, 'time': 'Sun, 01 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Up 95% for the Year, Could Solana Soar Even Higher? - The Motley Fool', 'content': 'Solana has two major catalysts in place that could help it realize its long-term potential.\n\nSolana (SOL 0.78%) is one of just a handful of large-market-cap cryptos that have outperformed Bitcoin this year. Solana is up 95% for the year, compared to 60% for Bitcoin. However, much of Solana\'s head-spinning performance came in the early part of the year. Since July 15, when it hit an intra-year high of $32, Solana is actually down 40%, as investors have increasingly soured on the crypto\'s future prospects.\n\nSo which way forward will it be for Solana? Will it continue its downward trajectory of the past 60 days, or will it find a way to soar even higher? There are two major factors to consider.\n\nSolana\'s partnership with Visa\n\nLet\'s start with the big partnership agreement that investors have been talking about ever since they returned from summer vacation. On Sept. 5, Visa (V 0.10%) inked a partnership deal with Solana, in which the credit card giant will use the Solana blockchain for processing transactions involving USD Coin, the second-largest stablecoin in the world. This stablecoin is pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar, making it possible for customers to pay with crypto instead of fiat currency at merchants that accept USD Coin.\n\nThere are several good reasons why Visa picked Solana. For one, the transaction processing speeds of Solana are elite. Visa needs a payment network that can process transactions as fast as it can, and Solana fits the bill. The theoretical transaction processing speed of Solana is 65,000 transactions per second, which is far superior to Visa\'s transaction processing rate of 24,000 transactions per second.\n\nSecondly, Solana has a solid track record of enabling crypto transactions that involve stablecoins. In February 2022, the crypto launched Solana Pay, which is a payment protocol for merchants willing to accept USD Coin as a form of payment. And last month, Solana partnered with Shopify on a Solana Pay integration for e-commerce sellers.\n\nThe big picture here is that Solana continues to build out real-world applications for its leading-edge blockchain technology. At the beginning of the year, Solana laid out its vision for the future, and it involves bringing super-fast blockchain technology to every niche of the real world, including the financial services sector. The goal, says Solana, is to match the same kind of throughput speeds as the New York Stock Exchange or other ultra-fast centralized computer networks.\n\nMobile crypto strategy\n\nMoreover, Solana is also moving ahead with its mobile crypto strategy. Solana first outlined this strategy in summer 2022, when it announced plans for a "crypto phone" powered by Android and built specifically for the Solana blockchain. It also made available tools and resources for mobile, so that developers could start building out apps for the Solana mobile ecosystem. Solana had a launch event for the mobile phone (known as the Saga) in April of this year, and it has been available for public sale since May 8.\n\nThe idea behind the Saga is simple but powerful: The future of crypto is mobile, and therefore all mobile devices should be optimized for crypto. People should be able to take their crypto with them wherever they go, and be able to use it easily in the real world. For example, right now it can be difficult to use a blockchain wallet on your mobile phone. Solana solved that problem with an innovation known as the Seed Vault, which securely holds the cryptographic keys required to access your blockchain wallet right on your mobile device.\n\nIn terms of future growth prospects, this is exactly what I\'m looking for as a long-term investor: a big idea that can catalyze rapid growth. The big caveat here, though, is that the "crypto phone" concept may not appeal to the average smartphone user, especially given its original retail price of $999. That\'s about the same price you\'d expect to pay for an Apple iPhone, and probably held back early demand. As a result, Solana is now offering the phone for $599.\n\nIs the best yet to come?\n\nSolana is trading for less than $20, which is approximately 50% below where it was trading at before the FTX crisis hit last year. So there is definitely some room to run. Even if Solana only makes it back to where it was trading just two months ago, it can still potentially deliver a huge return on investment.\n\nYes, the past year has been challenging for Solana, and there are some analysts who still think the price of Solana could crater all the way to $10, but I think these concerns are overblown. Solana is a crypto built for the long haul, and one that has very creative ideas about where the blockchain and crypto world is headed. As a result, I remain long-term bullish on Solana.'}]

The news articles suggest that Solana (SOL) is experiencing positive developments, such as potential breakouts against Ethereum, partnerships with Visa, and advancements in its mobile crypto strategy. These factors could contribute to SOL's growth potential and market dominance in certain aspects of blockchain technology. Additionally, Bitcoin's historical performance in October and November could indicate a potential rally in the cryptocurrency market. Therefore, based on these factors, it is likely that SOL and other altcoins may see an upward trend in the near future, with potential for increased trading opportunities and higher returns.

I look forward to attending events and continuing to support SBSD schools as a community member.”\n\nKing, who is an attorney, small business owner and executive coach and consultant, was first elected to the board in 2006. Last fall, she ran unopposed for her fifth term in Area 3, which includes portions of Carmel Valley and Rancho Santa Fe.\n\nMoving to the community for the schools, her children attended Carmel Creek and Solana Pacific where she took on leadership roles on the PTA and site council. Wanting to impact students at the district level, she decided to run for the school board: “I saw the district’s vision and I wanted to be a part of it.”\n\nServing on the board has been something she has enjoyed so much: “It’s been a tremendous experience.”\n\nShe was part of the building of Solana Ranch, Skyline and Solana Vista schools, as well as the difficult decision not to build the district’s eighth school in Pacific Highlands Ranch. Looking back she said it is proving to be the right decision and she is proud of the way that the board and district ensured that the community felt heard in the process and ultimately supported the district as they moved forward.\n\nDuring her tenure, King worked with four superintendents and was involved in hiring three of them, the most important job that a school board member has. She served as the board’s president through the pandemic, which she said was a lot of work, dealing with making tough decisions and facing challenges with divisiveness in the community.\n\n“In the end, it just brought us together and made us stronger,” King said. “I’m proud of the work we did as an entire district.”\n\nAs a board member King has always been thoughtful and intentional in the decisions she makes. She said she is grateful for the experience of being part of such a “high performing, high functioning” team, from the board to the superintendent and leadership cabinet to the principals, teachers and every single staff member whom she truly believes are there to do what’s best for students.\n\n“It has truly been my honor and privilege to work alongside Member King as part of SBSD’s governance team,” said Superintendent Jodee Brentlinger in the news release. “Her legacy will continue through the dedication she has shown to the SBSD community throughout her tenure.”\n\nKing will file her resignation with the San Diego County Office of Education effective Nov. 15. When a vacancy occurs, the board is required to fill the vacancy within 60 days, which in this case is by Jan. 13, 2024.\n\nAt a Sept. 28 special board meeting, the board voted to go with the provisional appointment process to fill the vacancy, rather than take on the cost of a special election. Neighboring San Dieguito’s 2021 special election for Area 5 cost $187,428.\n\nSolana Beach previously used the appointment process in March 2020 to appoint Dana King, now the board’s vice president.\n\nThe district is now accepting potential candidates and applications are due back by Nov. 1 at noon. The board plans to interview candidates in public on Nov. 9, with a swearing-in held the following month on Dec. 14.\n\nMuch like the Del Mar Union School District’s provisional appointment earlier this year, due to the length remaining in King’s term, the new trustee will serve until the next regularly scheduled general election in 2024. At that time, the appointed member could choose to run for a shortened two-year term through 2026.\n\nFor more information about the appointment process and timeline, including the application packet on the Solana Beach School District website, visit sbsd.k12.ca.us/\n\n'}]

While Solana may have the strength to reach it, it would be surprising to see it pass that level on the first attempt.\n\n3. Bullish Cross Sparks a Buying Frenzy\n\nThe 3-day MACD completed a bullish cross, and the buying pressure exploded this week. This is a major change in the market momentum and may last for quite some time before SOL enters a significant correction.\n\nBias\n\nThe bias for SOL is bullish.\n\nShort-Term Prediction for SOL Price\n\nThe biggest targets on the chart are $28 and $30. At this rate, Solana is likely to hit them. The biggest question is if SOL will also be able to sustain its price at those levels. In the past, sellers came in strong after the price hit $30.'}, {'id': 6, 'time': 'Tue, 03 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Vitalik Buterin and Solana's Anatoly Yakovenko Clash With Each Other - U.Today", 'content': 'Solana\'s cofounder Anatoly Yakovenko recently took to social media to criticize Ethereum, describing it as a "novel spectacle of bourgeois upheaval" rather than a genuine revolution. He argued that Ethereum perpetuates a form of digital tyranny, pressing upon the "toiling masses" with a different but equally oppressive boot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYakovenko emphasized the need for a truly stateless digital realm, where the cost of state creation is negligible, to emancipate people from capitalist intermediaries and state surveillance.\n\nIn response, Vitalik Buterin had earlier noted that "smart people" have told him Solana has an "earnest" developer community. This seemed like a subtle nod of approval toward Solana, but it also left room for interpretation.\n\nIt is somewhat self-righteous for Yakovenko to criticize Ethereum for not being a true revolution for the "toiling masses" when Solana itself has been propelled to the top of the cryptocurrency market with significant financial backing from VCs. This backing has arguably made Solana more of a "VC\'s blockchain" than a "people\'s blockchain."\n\nOn the other hand, Buterin\'s comment about Solana\'s "earnest" developer community is a more diplomatic approach. It acknowledges Solana\'s contributions without necessarily agreeing or disagreeing with its philosophy. However, it also subtly implies that while Solana may have an earnest community, that does not necessarily make it revolutionary or superior to Ethereum.\n\nBoth leaders raise compelling points. Yakovenko questions the social impact of blockchain technology, urging the community to aim for true decentralization and accessibility. Buterin, meanwhile, seems to focus on the practical aspects, implicitly suggesting that an "earnest" community can indeed bring about meaningful changes, even if it does not fully align with everyone\'s ideological expectations.'}, {'id': 3, 'time': 'Tue, 03 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'AI forecasts Solana price for the end of 2023 - Finbold - Finance in Bold', 'content': 'Despite opening the week on a bullish note, the majority of assets in the cryptocurrency sector are consolidating their earlier gains, including Solana (SOL), but for which certain artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms predict a much brighter future by the end of this year.\n\nAs it happens, the AI-driven price prediction algorithms over at the cryptocurrency tracking platform CoinCodex have set the price of Solana at $39.73 by December 31, 2023, which would indicate a gain of nearly 65% to its price at press time, as per the most recent data seen by Finbold on October 3.\n\nSolana 3-month price prediction.

Encinitas council members added a diversion program, with enforcement aimed at schools during the morning and afternoon hours when children are arriving and departing.\n\n“They’ve also indicated that they’ve noticed a definite trend toward more kids wearing helmets and obeying the laws,” Solana Beach City Manager Greg Wade said “Keep your fingers crossed, we hope that this will have an impact.”\n\nAccording to a city staff report, the ordinance will penalize “more violations for bicycle and e-bike-related behavior than just the prohibition of riding bicycles on sidewalks.”\n\nE-bike and bicycle riders will be required to “observe all applicable laws including yielding to pedestrians,” according to the text of the ordinance. Riding on sidewalks is banned on any street that has a designated bicycle path. It’s also illegal for riders to have passengers sitting on handlebars or anywhere else on the bike that isn’t designed to carry another person.\n\nGiven that Class 1 and 2 e-bikes can reach assisted speeds of up to 20 mph, and Class 3 e-bike riders can zoom up to 28 mph, residents have been concerned about children using them with little preparation or experience on the roads.\n\nThe issue of e-bike safety has been a priority followed by two recent fatalities, one in Carlsbad last year and one in Encinitas a few months ago.\n\nE-bike safety has also been a growing priority for state lawmakers.

Another bill proposed by Boerner would add licensing and age requirements for children to ride e-bikes.\n\nSolana Beach City Councilmember Jill MacDonald has repeatedly expressed her concern about children riding on sidewalks.\n\n“I hope one of the takeaways about this ordinance is that your children are on e-bikes, they’re not driving age, they’re on the streets, they’re not always obeying the traffic laws, they’re sometimes going through stop signs, they’re sometimes ignoring traffic lights,” MacDonald said. “Please make sure they’re safe.”'}, {'id': 10, 'time': 'Tue, 03 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Star Atlas Unlocks Tools to Help Game Devs Build on Solana - Decrypt', 'content': "Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub.

ATMTA launched a “showroom” demo on the Epic Games Store in September 2022. SAGE Labs (Star Atlas Golden Era) is a browser-based game that ties into the larger Star Atlas universe.\n\nATMTA said that it is making its Star Atlas data publicly available in the name of transparency and fostering trust among players and stakeholders, with the aim of also creating a broader ecosystem of apps around the game.\n\n“It's what transforms Star Atlas from just being a set of gaming products to a development platform,” Star Atlas CEO Michael Wagner told Decrypt’s GG in an exclusive interview. “You can even commercialize using those [Star Atlas] assets.”\n\nAs Wagner explained, ATMTA requires no cut for the first $1 million worth of gross revenue for any company that uses the tools. If a company using Star Atlas’ assets and branding begins generating more than $1 million in revenue, fees ranging from 3% to 10% kick in depending on which industry or sector the company operates within.\n\nIn a release, ATMTA wrote that the tools can be harnessed to create new functionality around SAGE Labs, but it can also enable creators to spin off into new genres and experiences built around the same assets and features.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n“This is also part of cultivating a flourishing ecosystem of people who want to build around Star Atlas,” Wagner added. “It effectively says that here's a repository of assets, including branding and Star Atlas imagery, that you are free to use.”\n\nWhile Wagner is optimistic about the rollout of the Star Atlas build platform and SAGE Labs, he did acknowledge that there could be hurdles to launching such public resources.\n\n“The only potential challenge is we just get a bunch of people asking questions because they want to build something using it. Maybe they don't completely understand it, but that's about it,” he said. “I think this is a win. Nevertheless, it's people coming in requiring resources from us to help get them started.”\n\nThough Star Atlas has been hotly anticipated by the Solana community, the road to success has not been without its bumps. In July, ATMTA reduced its staff by 73%, citing market conditions and spending needs. Wagner said that as painful as it was to let those people go, it was necessary and that the Star Atlas teams’ efficiency and momentum have improved significantly. He’s optimistic about where the company is heading.\n\n“Revenues are ticking up, and we're seeing a lot more peer-to-peer transaction volume, which helps us with our royalty fees,” Wagner said. “Sentiment in our community couldn't be higher.”\n\nWhile SAGE Labs' build hub is intended for the Solana ecosystem, Wagner said that anyone on any blockchain can benefit from the information and tools. Using SAGE Labs, he added, anyone can build their own front-end user interface (UI) or even customize gameplay mechanics and roll out a separate product.\n\n“If they build something that's better, it still uses all of the Star Atlas assets; that's how the programs are defined,” Wagner said. “And if that happens to get really popular, well, then we can just focus more of our attention on Unreal Engine. We still have to build more programs.”"}]

It combines proof-of-stake (PoS) with proof-of-history (PoH) as a consensus method.\n\nValidators play a crucial role in this architecture since they verify the validity of transactions and add them to the blockchain while ensuring the network remains secure and decentralized. A node must stake SOL to become a validator, with the amount of SOL staked determining voting power or “voting keys.” Like miners, validators are rewarded with SOL whenever they validate a block within each epoch.\n\nThere are 1,997 Solana validators at press time. However, the analyst notes that out of 1,997 validators, 1,818 received delegations from the Solana Foundation and Alameda Research.\n\nSolana validators have delegated 106 million SOL, of which 73 million are distributed from the Solana Foundation and 33 million from Alameda Research.\n\nThe analyst concludes that if it were not for the “heavy” incentivization, the Solana node count, validators, would be much lower. Arizon.eth adds that Solana has many nodes only because “two centralized entities are giving node operators free money.”\n\nBecause of this arrangement, the analyst continues, the Solana Foundation “can manipulate node operators to do what they want if they don’t want their stake pulled.” Arixon.eth further notes that many node operators have zero delegations from ordinary SOL holders.\n\nSolana Co-Founder Responds, Claims Stake Not Validator Count Is Important\n\nSolana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko has since responded to these allegations, saying that while roughly 2,000 validators, their nodes, and vote keys secure the network, not their respective stake.\n\nIn this statement, Yokovenko is emphasizing the importance of online votes and the significance of their votes. Since all validators approve valid blocks simultaneously, their votes, not the stake each holds, are important for network security and stability.\n\nAnytime a node unstakes SOL, claiming staking rewards and possibly rewards from block validation, their voting power reduces. In this way, the network will rely on other validators for decentralization and security, regardless of the stake held by each. A Solana node operator explained that the distribution of online validators will play a critical role whenever this happens.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView'}, {'id': 0, 'time': 'Wed, 04 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'New Report: Solana Network Bolstered by Increasing Node Count and Global Distribution - PR Newswire', 'content': 'The Solana Foundation\'s Validator Health Report highlights the network\'s widening geographic distribution of validators and the development of multiple validator clients\n\nSAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 4, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- The Solana Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to the Solana network\'s decentralization, adoption, and security, released its Validator Health Report today. The report underscores how the network is becoming increasingly decentralized and durable, showing the increased engagement of the validator community, as well as the continued development of multiple secondary validator clients.\n\nThe latest Validator Health report highlights how the Solana network continues to be one of the largest proof-of-stake networks, citing metrics such as total global node count, node distribution, and geographic and data center diversity. It also highlights Solana\'s resilience, which is increasingly reinforced by the ongoing transition into becoming a multi-client network.\n\n"Solana has become one of the most, if not the most, decentralized proof-of-stake blockchains in existence, and this recent report reinforces this," said Dan Albert, Executive Director of the Solana Foundation. "The network is becoming more resilient as a result of validators operating in more and more geographic jurisdictions around the world, and the network\'s resilience will be enhanced by the development and launch of multiple light clients and second validator clients, including Firedancer."\n\nIn recent months, the Solana Foundation doubled down on efforts to foster network health at the software level. This includes enhanced support for the development of new software clients and the growing network of core-contributing developers. Currently, there are four independent validator clients that are in active development, including Jito Labs , Firedancer , and Sig , as well as one built by Solana Labs. Serving as the operating system of the network, validator clients also enhance network resiliency and decentralization.\n\n"Solana is the only blockchain, apart from Ethereum, to feature more than one validator client, and this is a testament to the vision and drive of the many developers working tirelessly to make this network as performant and reliable as possible," Albert said.\n\nThe strength of Solana\'s network can also be seen using additional metrics to analyze network health: The number of block-producing nodes is 1,961 globally, and the Nakamoto Coefficient – which measures the minimum number of validators necessary to corrupt the network – stands at 31 as of September 6, 2023. Improvements in these and other metrics mean that it will become increasingly difficult for the network to be influenced by any one government, corporation, or individual.\n\nTo further bolster the network\'s health, the Solana Foundation also provides tools and educational support for the network\'s community of validators. The Foundation strives to produce rigorous, intellectually honest assessments of network health, and it encourages participants in the Solana community to share thoughts on this subject here .\n\nThe full Solana Foundation Validator Health Report can be accessed here .\n\nAbout Solana Foundation\n\nThe Solana Foundation is a non-profit foundation based in Zug, Switzerland, dedicated to the decentralization, adoption, and security of the Solana network.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin's dominance over the alternative cryptos is strong at 49.4%.\n\nAccording to the latest edition of the weekly market report from cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, Bitcoin reserves on centralized exchanges (CEXs) have plummeted to levels not seen since early January 2018, when the market topped and the bull market ended.\n\nCurrently, only 2.03 million BTC sit on exchanges, according to the Bitfinex Alpha report.\n\nIn its report, the crypto trading platform noticed a correlation between this drop in exchange reserves and increasing crypto prices, suggesting that the market may be in for a bull run.\n\nBTC reserves on exchanges have actually been declining since they hit a peak in March 2020, and that's when the asset's price began to rise. This shows that the reserves hitting their highs matches the beginning of a bull market, indicating a possible inverse relationship between BTC's price and exchange reserves.\n\nWhile exchange reserves declined while crypto prices increased, the drop in BTC price back in Nov. 2021 and the continued drop in exchange reserves challenged this connection. This is because investors also tend to hold less BTC on exchanges during bear markets.\n\nDespite that, many market indicators show that long-term holders, as well as a large part of the short-term investors, are currently in a HODL phase. While the 12-18-month supply holders are in a position to profit on some of their holdings, long-term and short-term holder supply has remained inactive. This is a sign that investors across multiple cohorts are confident that BTC will not see a massive slump from its current price, Bitfinex said.\n\nCrypto Market Recovery\n\nAfter the brutal 2022, which saw the tumultuous collapse of several big players, crypto prices, volumes, and venture capital investment remain well below their 2021 peaks. This also coincided with central banks beginning to hike rates in early 2022, making investors risk-averse and seeking better returns elsewhere.\n\nIn September 2023, total monthly volumes across spot and derivative markets fell to $1.4 trillion, a decline of more than 60% from September 2022, as per researcher CCData. Spot markets, in particular, are down more than 70% at $272 billion, while derivative volumes have fallen by 60% to $1.1 trillion during this time period.\n\nMuch like volatility and volume, venture capital (VC) investments have also slowed considerably this year. In Q1 of 2022, US VC crypto investments totaled $6.12 billion but slumped to just $870 million in the same quarter this year, according to data firm PitchBook.\n\nHowever, the market has come a long way since the lows of Nov. 2022, when the crypto exchange FTX collapsed. Bitcoin has regained more than 72% of its value, and the total crypto market cap is above $1 trillion, which hit a two-year low of $796 billion at the time.\n\nOctober has already started on a green note. Talking about the immediate price action, Bitfinex analysts stated in its report that a green October succeeded on three occasions where BTC ended September on a positive note. “Crucially, we've closed September in the green, a rare occurrence. Historically, a positive September ushers in a bullish October, and the volatility as well as the futures market metrics all point towards increased volatility and some upside, at least on the higher time frames,” said the analysts.\n\nA Look at SOL's Market Performance\n\nAt the time of writing, crypto is in the mix, with Ether exchanging hands at $1,648, and the total crypto market cap stands at $1.12 trillion. Meanwhile, the $198.3 bln ETH's competitor SOL, which has a market capitalization of $9.7 bln, is trading at $23.60.\n\nIn the past 24 hours, however, the SOL price has dropped 2.2% but is still up 21.4% in the past week and over 140% in 2023 so far. SOL has lost 30% of its value over the past year and is currently down 91% from its all-time high (ATH) of $260 hit on Nov. 6, 2021.\n\nSOL's price against ETH, meanwhile, is at 0.0143, up from 0.0089 in May this year but down from 0.156 on Jan. 8, 2023. SOL-ETH peaked at 0.469 in Sept. 2021, only to decline to 0.00832 in Dec. 2022.\n\nThis latest price action helped Solana become the 8th largest cryptocurrency by market cap, taking over Dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano (ADA). SOL has actually reported its strongest week since mid-July and recorded a 38% increase from its September low, though these numbers are nowhere near their peak during the bull market.\n\nSOL was actually one of the coins that was majorly hit by FTX implosion due to the crypto exchange founder Sam Bankman-Fried's (SBF) heavy involvement and investment in the Solana ecosystem. In Nov. 2022, SOL was trading around $37 when the news of FTX's bankruptcy and SBF's misuse of customer funds became public, and the crypto asset lost more than 67.5% ..."}]

However, this increase underscores the recent influx of investors into the network’s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.\n\nThis surge is a notable departure from the previous year’s trend. In 2022, Solana’s DeFi TVL experienced a gradual decline, influenced by the decreasing value of SOL and the broader market downturn. Concerns regarding the project’s association with bankrupt FTX further exacerbated this decline.\n\nHowever, the network has enjoyed some growth this year and has seen its TVL climb from $210 million to the current levels. This represents an increase of close to 40% on the year-to-date metrics.\n\nIt’s worth noting that, despite this recent growth, Solana’s DeFi TVL remains significantly below its all-time high, which exceeded $10 billion during the peak of the 2021 bull market. During that time, the Solana blockchain was widely touted as a potential “Ethereum killer.”\n\nSolana still faces major headwinds.\n\nSolana’s ecosystem is enjoying notable growth this year, scoring adoptions from Visa, Shopify, and other major traditional institutions. However, the blockchain network still faces major challenges.\n\nSolana’s SOL token was one of the numerous digital assets the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) labeled as securities in its legal actions against major cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance and Coinbase.\n\nThis classification led to the prompt removal of the asset by several trading platforms like Revolut, Bakkt, and others.\n\nBesides that, the network’s token still faces significant selling pressure ahead as the Court has approved the bankrupt FTX move to sell its substantial digital asset holdings, which includes an over $1 billion position in SOL.\n\nThese issues have contributed significantly to the struggles SOL’s price has faced this year. As of press time, SOL was trading for $23.06, up by more than 133% on the year-to-date metric, per CryptoSlate’s data.\n\nMentioned in this article'}, {'id': 8, 'time': 'Thu, 05 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Solana (SOL) Shows 20% Gain in Market's Top 100, Here Are Main Reasons - U.Today", 'content': "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nSolana (SOL) has been making headlines recently with a 20% gain among the top 100 cryptocurrencies, currently trading at $23.09. But what's driving this impressive performance? Let's delve into the factors contributing to Solana's surge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the main attractions of Solana is its cost-effective access to decentralized finance (DeFi). Ethereum is notorious for having enormous gas fees at certain periods of time, scaring off some investors.\n\nWhile Solana's total value locked (TVL) in DeFi has seen an increase, the numbers are not as impressive as one might think. The TVL has only risen by about $7 million. In comparison, Ethereum's TVL is much higher, and even a modest growth on its part would easily outperform Solana's current TVL.\n\nThe market sentiment around Solana is generally positive, especially with the ongoing developments in its ecosystem. New projects and partnerships are continually being announced, adding to investor confidence.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, Solana has managed to maintain a strong position. The asset has shown resilience in a somewhat volatile market, securing its 25% growth and maintaining above core technical thresholds.\n\nSolana has a robust roadmap with several upcoming upgrades and new features. These developments could further enhance its utility and, by extension, its price.\n\nWhile Solana is experiencing a surge, it is essential to consider the broader context. Its DeFi TVL is not as substantial as it could be, and Ethereum remains a strong competitor. However, Solana offers a cheaper and faster alternative for DeFi enthusiasts, which could be a significant factor in its current price rally. Investors should keep an eye on this asset but also remain cautious of the volatile nature of the crypto market."}, {'id': 6, 'time': 'Thu, 05 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Crypto: SOL validators receive subsidies from Alameda! - Cointribune EN', 'content': "Thu 05 Oct 2023 ▪ 4 min of reading ▪ by Fenelon L.\n\nControversy is brewing in the Solana ecosystem, fueled by allegations that the Solana Foundation and Alameda Research are heavily subsidizing the network’s validators. The debate is crystallizing around the impact of these subsidies on the decentralization and sustainability of SOL, Solana’s native crypto.\n\nMassive subsidies to SOL Validators raise questions about crypto-centralization\n\nSolana, a blockchain known for its speed and direct competition with Ethereum, finds itself at the heart of a debate linked to the substantial subsidy of its validators by the Solana Foundation and Alameda Research, the defunct commercial arm associated with FTX.\n\nAccording to analyst arixon.eth, over 90% of Solana’s validators benefit from massive subsidies from the Solana Foundation and Alameda Research. At first glance, these figures are alarming: out of 1,997 validators, 1,818 are said to have received delegations from these two entities. In total, they delegated 106 million SOL, of which 73 million were distributed by the Foundation and 33 million by Alameda Research.\n\nValidators play an essential role in Solana’s blockchain. They are responsible for validating transactions and adding them to the blockchain. To ensure the network’s security and decentralization, each node must store SOL, and this amount of SOL determines their voting power.\n\nThe scale of these subsidies raises questions about the centralization of power within the blockchain. Arixon.eth suggests that without these “heavy incentives”, the number of Solana validator nodes would be much lower.\n\nMore worryingly, a notable number of nodes seem to be left behind, without delegations from the standard SOL holders, raising the question of the disproportionate influence of two entities on the network.\n\nIn highlighting these considerable subsidies, arixon.eth warns of the risk of Solana’s centralization under the hegemony of two predominant players. This, it argues, could potentially undermine the long-term value of SOLs and pose a critical dilemma for the decentralized robustness of the network.\n\nFunding for stability or manipulation?\n\nFaced with these allegations, Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder of Solana, stepped in to clarify the situation. According to him, although some 2,000 validators secure the network, it is their votes, and not their respective participation, that are essential to the network’s security and stability.\n\nEvery time a node withdraws from SOL, its voting power diminishes, forcing the network to rely on other validators to maintain decentralization and security.\n\nThe question of centralization is a hot topic in the crypto world. While Solana benefits from substantial funding from two major entities, this raises legitimate questions about the network’s true decentralization.\n\nHowever, one question remains: can the current model, criticized for its tendency towards centralization, ensure the network’s long-term stability and security, or does the Solana blockchain need to revise its delegation strategy to preserve the integrity of its decentralized architecture?\n\nThe revelation of exorbitant subsidies to validators is prompting the crypto community to re-examine blockchain governance structures and business models, and to question the delicate balance between incentives and decentralization.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

Since a blockchain is a distributed computer network that runs a consensus protocol in order to agree on the correct order of transactions, most blockchains can be successfully attacked if a single party gains control of the majority of nodes in the system.\n\nThe coefficient was designed by former Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan to provide a measure for the level of decentralization, and by extension, the robustness of a given blockchain network. Solana’s announcement that it is now more decentralized when compared against other leading chains follows a series of positive developments for the project.\n\nSolana’s Nakamoto Coefficient score now beats Ethereum (ETH), Avalanche (AVAX), Cosmos (ATOM), and Polygon (MATIC), to name a few. The project has shared a detailed breakdown for the health of the Solana network in its recent Validator Report, discussing a range of key developments that have helped the network to improve the health of the network.\n\nPreviously, Solana had been criticized for being less decentralized than its competitors — a problem that caused several network outages during its first 2 years on mainnet. A new validator client created by Jito Labs was cited as a key reason why this is unlikely to occur again, and there are two additional validator clients currently in development that can further improve network resilience.\n\nMost notably, the Solana network now contains more nodes than many major blockchains, in addition to these nodes being more widely distributed. This has given Solana a Nakamoto Coefficient score of 31, beating out Ethereum’s 25 and Avalanche’s 27 respectively. This news means that Solana is now one of the most decentralized blockchains in addition to being one of the most scalable.\n\nFollowing spree of positive developments, algorithm predicts +343% move for SOL in the next 12 months\n\nSOL has outperformed the rest of the crypto market during 2023, owing to a particularly poor performance in 2022. The SOL token suffered a -78% loss in the aftermath of the FTX collapse, as investors may have lost confidence in a project that was strongly backed by both FTX and Alameda Research.\n\nYear-to-date, SOL has risen 133%, outperforming the total crypto market cap (TCAP) which has risen 41% in the same time frame. The CoinCodex price prediction algorithm expects SOL to continue its recovery over the next 12 months, forecasting a +343.67% move by 4th October 2024.\n\n1-year price prediction for Solana, via CoinCodex\n\nBottom line: Solana continues to optimize its network, improving robustness and decentralization\n\nDecentralized computer systems rely on the trusted nature of the majority of participants, while also providing financial incentives to help ensure the efficacy of the consensus protocol. The more decentralized a network is, the more robust it becomes, and Solana’s recent achievement of becoming one of the most decentralized proof-of-stake networks is another major success for the project.'}]

The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a cautious and conservative approach in navigating market volatility.

Considering the mixed signals in the ETH market and the positive sentiment surrounding Solana, it is prudent to adopt a long-term strategy focused on risk management and sustainable growth. Short-term gains may be overshadowed by market uncertainty, making it crucial to prioritize long-term profitability.

Given the current market conditions and the potential for a bullish trend in Solana, I would take a slightly bullish stance on ETH with a trading action of 0.3. This reflects a moderate level of confidence in the market trend while also acknowledging the need to manage risk effectively. By maintaining a conservative approach and closely monitoring market trends, I aim to capitalize on opportunities for sustainable growth in the long run.

REASONING:
After reviewing the reports from the on-chain analyst, news analyst, and reflection analyst, it is clear that there are mixed signals in the market for ETH and Solana (SOL). The on-chain analyst report indicates a bearish sentiment for ETH due to sell signals in the MACD indicator, while the news analyst report suggests a bullish trend for SOL with positive developments and potential for growth. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a cautious and conservative approach in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market.

Considering these factors, it is important to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains in order to manage risks effectively. While the short-term market trends may be uncertain, focusing on sustainable growth opportunities and staying informed about broader cryptocurrency ecosystem developments will be key in making informed trading decisions.

Therefore, my trading action would be to buy ETH with a confidence level of 0.3. This decision reflects a cautious approach while still taking advantage of potential opportunities for long-term growth in the cryptocurrency market.

DAILY RETURN:
-0.011807242162335085
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is experiencing fluctuations in price with a potential bearish trend in the short term. The increasing interest in ETH trading is evident from the rise in successful transactions, but caution is advised due to the sell trend indicated by the MACD signal.

The news analyst report highlights the positive short-term trend for Solana (SOL) due to recent price gains and network developments. However, concerns about long-term sustainability due to heavy subsidization of validators raise potential risks for SOL prices.

The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a cautious and conservative approach in navigating the cryptocurrency market's mixed signals. Long-term strategies and risk management are crucial for successful outcomes in the face of market uncertainty.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is evident that a conservative trading approach focusing on long-term strategies is recommended. While short-term gains may be tempting, managing risks effectively and capitalizing on sustainable growth opportunities should be the priority.

Therefore, I would take a conservative approach and decide to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.5 to manage risks appropriately and align with the recommended long-term strategy.

The news articles highlight both positive and negative aspects of the Solana (SOL) ecosystem. On the positive side, Solana's DeFi ecosystem is experiencing growth, with increased TVL and partnerships with major institutions. Additionally, Solana has improved its network decentralization, surpassing other leading blockchains in Nakamoto Coefficient score. However, concerns about centralization due to substantial subsidies to validators by the Solana Foundation and Alameda Research, as well as regulatory challenges, pose risks to the network. Despite these challenges, the overall sentiment around Solana remains positive, with potential for further growth in the NFT space and price appreciation in the coming months. Investors should monitor developments closely to assess the impact on SOL's price and market trend.

Students took on the duties of snipping the ceremonial red ribbon for the modernized campus that SBSD Superintendent Jodee Brentlinger said maximizes the learning experience for all students.\n\nFrom the initial design team meetings in 2018 to the finishing touches placed last month, the project was a five-year “adventure”. The modernization journey was delayed by district attendance boundary decisions and weathered issues like a global pandemic, ever-rising construction costs, atmospheric rivers, supply chain challenges, labor shortages and a construction process that occurred over a two-year period on an occupied campus.\n\n“I can say without hesitation, it was quite a ride,” Principal Matthew Frumovitz said.\n\nFrumovitz believes the results were worth the journey, with the refreshed school entry, remodeled administrative offices, brand new kindergarten playground, enhanced child nutrition area, covered dining areas for students, revamped pick-up and drop-off area for efficiency and safety, and an “unbelievably fantastic” new two-story classroom building. The overhaul also included new carpet and furniture in all classrooms and new heating, ventilation, air conditioning and fire alarm systems throughout.\n\nStudents helped snip the ribbon at the Solana Santa Fe grand reopening. (Karen Billing)\n\nHe was thankful for the teachers, staff, students and families who demonstrated flexibility, adaptability and patience over the past two years: “This was done all for the good and ultimately for the benefit of our most precious resource: our children.”\n\nAs SBSD School board Vice President Dana King noted with gratitude, the school’s $26 million “rebirth” was made possible by Measure JJ bond funds, passed by the community in 2016.\n\n“If it weren’t for our constructive citizenry and belief in great schools for great kids, we would not have this amazing new campus to celebrate and be so proud of,” said King, who served on the district’s bond oversight committee before joining the school board.\n\nThis year Solana Santa Fe is celebrating its 30-year anniversary—the school originally opened with 10 classrooms and eight relocatable buildings in 1993. Assistant Superintendent of Operations John Leeland shared the fun fact that the school’s 1991 groundbreaking was actually held at the Fairbanks Ranch Country Club due to a number of water issues found on the site during construction. Marsi Hays, a teacher who was at the school when it opened in 1993,remains at the school as a third grade teacher.\n\nAn additional classroom building was added in 1997 but the portables remained until this campus renovation took place, replaced with the two-story eight classroom building.\n\nSolana Santa Fe student Niveta Anand led a campus tour.\n\n(Karen Billing)\n\nFollowing the ribbon cutting, Solana Santa Fe students led campus tours of the upgraded facilities as well as the newly enhanced school garden, with a fence painted to look like colorful crayons. New signage placed before a flowering archway reads: “In our garden we plant seeds of kindness, dance with the butterflies, wish for sun and rain, pause to play in the dirt, learn from Ms. Barbara and enjoy the beauty”.\n\nStudent Niveta Anand led one tour with visiting VIPs such as SBSD board members Vicki King and Julie Union as well as Superintendents Holly McClurg, Andrée Grey and Jill Vinson from the Del Mar, Encinitas and Cardiff School Districts.'}, {'id': 10, 'time': 'Fri, 06 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Price Analysis: Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL) - The Cryptonomist', 'content': 'SPONSORED POST*\n\nRecent financial landscapes are characterized by unpredictability, evident from the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield’s sharp rise of almost 90 basis points this year. This follows a hefty 200 bp climb last year. Adding to the mix, the S&P 500 Index has reported a dip of 5.89% over the past month, now resting at $4263.76. This turmoil isn’t just limited to traditional sectors; the crypto world is equally affected. Enigma Securities has recently projected a calm period in the crypto arena, expecting the volatility to take a back seat for the coming months. Vetle Lunde from K33 Research supports this sentiment, hinting at a stagnant October in the markets, providing a prime window for long-haul investors.\n\nThe conventional markets, after weathering a stormy session, found solace with the release of the latest job figures indicating a lukewarm U.S. labor market. The U.S. economy, as per the ADP’s recent report, managed to add only 89,000 jobs in September. This figure starkly contrasts the expected 153,000 and even falls short of August’s 180,000. Kathy Jones from Charles Schwab amplified this sentiment, stating that this was the feeblest private sector job growth since 2020.\n\nBitcoin (BTC): A Phoenix Rising Amidst Uncertainty\n\n\n\nThe recent report from Matrixport highlights the Bitcoin (BTC) resilience, noting its break from a downtrend and successfully consolidating above the $27,000 mark.\n\nWithin this framework of potential growth, the Bitcoin (BTC) current price exhibits fluctuations, ranging between $25,428 and $28,000. The 10-Day and 100-Day Moving Averages, standing at $27,176 and $28,137 respectively, underscore a balanced yet cautious market sentiment. Additionally, the drop in trading volumes from $19 billion to $11 billion signifies a need for close observation.\n\nMatrixport’s projection indicates a potential move towards the $30,000 mark. However, market dynamics emphasize the importance of monitoring resistance levels. Should Bitcoin (BTC) surpass the $29,029 resistance level, we could foresee a climb towards the $31,600 mark. Conversely, failure to do so might prompt a retraction to the foundational $25,428 or potentially deeper to lower support levels.\n\nWhile Bitcoin (BTC) remains a preferred asset for many crypto enthusiasts, new contenders like ScapesMania may offer a breakthrough in diversifying your portfolio.\n\nSolana (SOL): Comprehensive Market Assessment\n\n\n\nProminent market voices, including analysts like “CryptoGodJohn”, have indicated a positive trajectory for Solana, emphasizing a possible surge in its valuation in the forthcoming quarters.\n\nHowever, the Solana (SOL) current price range of $18.55 to $23.00, complemented by its Moving Averages, signals a market in careful deliberation. While the short-term 10-Day Moving Average stands at $21.66, the longer 100-Day Average is pegged at $21.73, providing a consolidated view of the asset’s performance.\n\nGiven current market indicators, if Solana (SOL) breaks through the $24.62 resistance, a journey towards the $29.07 level will be feasible. On the contrary, inability to maintain momentum might see a regression towards its base at $18.55 or further downward movement to established support levels. Amidst the uncertainty about the future of Solana (SOL), a rising star like ScapesMania can be a worthy bet.\n\nScapesMania: A Glimpse into the Future of Gaming and Cryptocurrency Fusion\n\nScapesMania is the revolutionary project in the Web3 space. It offers an opportunity for Web3 enthusiasts and backers to tap into the booming Web2 gaming market, projected to reach $521.61 billion in revenue by 2027.\n\nKey Highlights of ScapesMania\n\nScapesMania is not a single project; it’s a thriving gaming ecosystem with diverse revenue streams.

growth in the NFT and crypto liquid staking sectors - The Cryptonomist', 'content': 'After a tumultuous 2022 for Solana in which the crypto project lost its main backer, namely FTX, here come the first positive signs of recovery with several metrics showing growth, especially in the NFT and liquid staking sectors.\n\nSuccessful implementations in the technology stack and important new partnerships are driving the resurgence of Solana and its crypto SOL, which many are still betting on, including institutional investors.\n\nWill the famous “Ethereum killer” blockchain network be able to return to its heyday with its decentralized ecosystem?\n\nWe see it together in this article.\n\nSolana’s progress in recent months: excellent numbers in liquid staking\n\nSolana has been posting excellent numbers since the beginning of the year after a catastrophic 2022, with the NFT and liquid staking sectors driving the crypto project’s progress.\n\nStarting with the basics, we can see how during 2023 Solana’s TVL increased from 25.12 million SOL to the current 30.95 million.\n\nEven in USD, the metric marks an increase of more than 50%, giving investors hope that the worst of the bear market is now behind us.\n\nIndeed, the emotional and image damage caused by the collapse of the FTX exchange in November 2022 (the main backer for technology developments) and all the recent problems related to network outages seem to have been overcome.\n\nThe crypto project team continues to innovate with major improvements in the technology stack achieving major milestones in the NFT market (which we will elaborate on in the next section) and achieving 100% chain uptime since the beginning of the year.\n\nThis is an excellent achievement for Solana considering that it has been repeatedly attacked publicly, as often in the past it has been necessary to perform a synchronized reboot of the network through the coordinated intervention of the validator team.\n\nIn addition, the two partnerships signed with Shopify and Visa in the past two months have been well received by the community, with both companies developing their services on top of the decentralized infrastructure.\n\nOn the liquid staking front, we can see that in the last month all LSD protocols on Solana have seen strong growth with TVL increasing in double digit percentages.\n\nJito for example has seen a 62.33% increase in value locked within the application over the past 30 days, while the top-of-the-line protocol Marinade Finance has grown by 20.65%.\n\nOver the course of the year, more than 2.4 million SOLs have been added to Jito, sending metrics on this platform soaring.\n\nInvestors are seizing the profit opportunities in a niche sector such as liquid staking on Solana, where only 3-4% of SOLs are actually being staked while on Ethereum we can observe a percentage around 40% for the same context.\n\nThe return offered by these crypto platforms is twice as high as those offered by Lido, RocketPool and Stakewise on Ethereum, where however we can count a higher level of security.\n\nCurrently, the LSD market on Solana is worth about $258 million, and forecasts assume further upside on the horizon.\n\nCrypto: Solana improves some waits in its technology stack and reduces minting costs for NFTs by 2,000 times\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Solana’s developers have moved over the past year to introduce key upgrades by improving its technology stack.\n\nThe positive effects have been seen in terms of both the development of the crypto ecosystem as a whole and the NFT market in particular.\n\nOne of the most interesting updates to mention in this regard is Firedancer, which by promoting significant optimizations should make Solana’s validation client much more effective than the foundation’s current client.\n\nTo date, only 3% of the crypto market is on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) while the remaining 97% works primarily with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n\nAt each Firedancer and hardware/bandwidth side improvements could contribute to SVM adoption.\n\nTurning instead to the NFT topic, it is worth noting the innovation introduced in April this year with the “State Compression” solution that greatly reduced storage costs by keeping data off the original chain.\n\nBy leaving only essential data on the Solana chain and using the Merkle Trees structure, the developers arrived at a compressed version of non-fungible tokens, namely cNFTs, which are highly optimized on the data storage side.\n\nIn June 2023, Tensor launched its compressed NFT market by taking advantage of this technology implementation and capturing most of the market share of the collectible cryptographic asset market on Solana.\n\nThe main advantage of “State Compression” is essentially about reducing the cost of mining per c-NFT by being the storage itself (done off-chain) better challenging.\n\nConsider that without the compression technology, the minting cost for 1 million NFTs would have been $253,000 whereas now it requires only $113.\n\nThis is a reduction of more than 2,000 times the cost of minting, which is a key competitive advantage within t...'}]

*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing a bearish trend with fluctuations in open prices and transaction volumes. This indicates a lack of significant market movement and potential for further decline in the near future. 

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights the negative impact of illicit activities on Thorswap, leading to a plummet in RUNE, while also pointing out positive developments in the Solana ecosystem. The growth in NFT and liquid staking sectors of Solana suggests a potential resurgence for the cryptocurrency, despite short-term uncertainty caused by the RUNE incident.

In line with the reflection analyst report, it is evident that a conservative approach focusing on long-term strategies and risk management is more successful in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. Short-term gains and not fully considering potential risks have proven to be ineffective strategies.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is advisable to adopt a conservative trading approach and prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains. The market trend appears to be bearish for ETH in the short term, but the positive developments in the Solana ecosystem could contribute to a bullish trend in the long term.

Therefore, I would take a cautious approach and assign a trading action of -0.5, reflecting my moderate confidence in the bearish trend for ETH in the short term and my strategic decision to manage risk appropriately by focusing on long-term growth opportunities.

However, it seems that singing in a Benidorm bar has given him more than just stardom because Asa, 41, actually met his wife Natalie Elliott while he was on stage serenading the crowds.\n\n"I met my wife in Benidorm," Asa exclusively told the Mirror at last year\'s Benicon, a convention for the fans and cast of the hit show which ran from 2007 to 2018. "I was just performing out here and she\'d never seen the TV show, which helped.

"My wife is a sexual health worker, she does all the testing. Its very interesting and very different. She\'s not in the entertainment industry," he explains. Asa and his wife have two children, Buddy, born in 2020, and Rockie whom Natalie gave birth to in October of last year. Asa\'s wife shared the news of the family\'s new arrival on Twitter at the time, writing, "Our littlest Elliott, she\'s going to be a Rockstar. 8lb 8.5oz of pure sass."

A strong pullback occurred after prices broke $17, and prices are now down to around $15.\n\nMeanwhile,InQubeta (QUBE) and Solana (SOL) have emerged as top altcoins to invest in. SOL prices rose by 974% in 2023, and its market share grew considerably. It’s one of the best DeFi projects around, and it might even enjoy more growth in 2024.\n\nQUBE prices surged 175% in 2023, and it’s set for 60% more growth before tokens launch on exchanges. Projections have QUBE prices growing as much as 10,000%, especially given how undervalued tokens are at their present price of $0.01925.\n\nTop altcoins to invest in: Analysts dub InQubeta a good crypto to buy in 2024\n\nInQubeta could be 2024’s biggest winner thanks to the creative way it intends to make artificial intelligence (AI) investments more accessible. The project is hosted on the Ethereum (ETH) network, allowing it to share its security and functionality.\n\nInQubeta is the first decentralized finance platform to focus on artificial intelligence, which sets it up for tremendous growth as investments in the space grow considerably. AI investments presently exceed $120 billion, and that figure is estimated to reach $1.5 trillion by 2030.\n\nThe increasing viability of AI is responsible for this tremendous surge in investment capital, and InQubeta is well-positioned to play a significant role in directing some of these funds to startups by providing a more efficient and accessible investment medium.\n\nInvesting in AI today is like investing in online media giants like Netflix during the internet’s early days. AI will reshape the world in the coming years, and those who invest in some of the startups emerging today will earn substantial profits in the coming years.\n\nA hassle-free investment protocol\n\nInvestors don’t have to worry about unreasonable requirements when investing in AI through InQubeta. They simply purchase QUBE and use it to buy ERC20 coins that signify investment opportunities.\n\nThese tokens are the blockchain’s version of stocks, and they appreciate over time as their makers grow their market capitalizations.\n\nERC20 coins are made by AI startups seeking capital, fractionalized, and sold on the NFT marketplace. Investors who buy these tokens can resell them in the marketplace whenever they choose.\n\nSolana (SOL) is one of the top crypto coins to buy right now\n\nSolana was once one of the many rivals of the Ethereum network, but it’s now its main competitor, thanks to the massive growth the project enjoyed in 2023. It closed out the year extremely strong, with 79% growth in December, and many expect similar growth patterns in 2024 as Bitcoin’s (BTC) price increases are expected to encourage bullish sentiments all over the cryptocurrency space.\n\nSolana provides a DeFi ecosystem that has been a massive success with users and the network is constantly improving to better serve its uses.\n\nChainlink (LINK) leaves investors worried after poor December showing\n\nChainlink provides a protocol that allows blockchain networks to communicate with external data sources, allowing developers to create hybrid smart contracts that use variables from the external world for their computations.\n\nIts utility should push LINK prices upward in 2024, but it’s highly unlikely to enjoy as much growth as QUBE or SOL.\n\nSummary\n\nQUBE and SOL are two of the top altcoins to invest in right now to earn major profits in 2024. SOL prices could grow by more than 1,000%, while QUBE prices could surge as high as 10,000% as investors flock to its ecosystem for easier access to AI investments.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nJoin The InQubeta Communities'}, {'id': 2, 'time': 'Sat, 07 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'All you need to know about Solana’s latest upgrade - AMBCrypto News', 'content': "The new upgrade allows ZK proofs to enhance runtime support for Solana.\n\nWith encryption on SPL tokens, users can make private transactions without compromising on security.\n\nSolana [SOL] has finally adopted a new update to its validator client known as the Solana v1.16. In an article posted on 6 October, the project’s ultimate developer platform Helium, wrote a detailed explainer on what the latest upgrade is about.\n\nRealistic or not, here’s SOL’s market cap in ETH terms\n\nZK-SNARKS to the rescue\n\nBefore going into the attributes, Helius gave a step-by-step report of how the v1.16 was tested. According to the post, the upgrade was in development for ten good months with efforts by both volunteers and canary nodes.\n\nFor context, a canary node involves the testing of a new feature with real users before it’s eventually deployed. Helius noted that the Solana v1.16 had been running on Testnet since 7 June.\n\nThe development team, however, noted that there were some issues with the RPC nodes and a bit of security.\n\nBut with the help of the canary node, Solana was able to call in Halborn a blockchain security solution firm to audit the upgrade before it went live on Mainnet Beta.\n\nInterestingly, the features of the new upgrade constituted some of the benefits users and validators have been hoping Solana integrates.\n\nFirst, Solana noted that the v1.16 upgrade allows for the effective implementation of Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (ZK-SNARKS). Typically, ZK features are known to be linked with Ethereum [ETH] scaling solutions.\n\nHowever, Solana’s decision to implement it was because of its mission to enhance runtime support for ZK computations. Hence, the report mentioned that,\n\n“These operations are standardized on Ethereum through EIP-196, EIP-197, and EIP-198. The introduction of alt_bn128 syscalls is a significant leap towards bridging the compatibility gap.”\n\nIndexing and more for validators\n\nAnother feature introduced with the upgrade is confidential transfers which also need the Zero-Knowldege input. With Solana’s confidential transfers, users can improve privacy and encrypt transactions and balances of SPL tokens.\n\nSPL is an acronym for Solana Program Library. They are similar to Ethereum’s ERC-20 tokens. But what SPL tokens do is a bit different from ERC-20 tokens. Still, they follow a specific standard for creating and managing tokens on the Solana blockchain.\n\nFor validators, the v1.16 upgrade automatically reduces the Random Access Memory Usage (RAM) for indexing accounts. Since the deployment of the upgrade, validators now run on 39 GB of RAM instead of the previous 120GB. This was also confirmed by Yanshu, a developer from Luganodes.\n\n1/\n\nWe've been closely monitoring memory requirements for running @solana nodes & it's remarkable how they've dropped since the release of v1.16! ? We recently upgraded our nodes to the latest v1.16.14, which comes with host of performance improvements & enhanced resiliency?? pic.twitter.com/D1B423y0Ey — Yanshu | Luganodes (@0xyanshu) September 28, 2023\n\nAt press time, data from Solana Beach showed that there were 1,993 validators on the blockchain. Also, 81.1% of the nodes were operating on v1.16.14 while 12.14% upgraded to v1.16.15.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 SOLs worth today?\n\nOther features of the new upgrade include better resource allocation for deploying applications. Also, v.1.16 addresses introduced the Epoch Account Hash, which allows the Solana network to increase security by identifying corrupt data.\n\nWhile Solana admitted that the ZK integration was long overdue, it noted that it won’t rest on its oars. In concluding the report, its development arm noted that Solana could be working on releasing another upgrade in the next three months, and v1.17 could be next."}, {'id': 9, 'time': 'Sat, 07 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'A rundown of what transpired with BTC, ETH, and the rest in Q3 - AMBCrypto News', 'content': 'Solana outperforming Bitcoin and Ethereum was the major highlight of the last quarter.\n\nOP and MKR had their highs as there were more to look forward to in Q4.\n\nThe third quarter of 2023 (Q3) was full of twists and turns for the crypto market led by Bitcoin [BTC]. At some point, market participants had much to celebrate. Other times, the conviction that the market would either be favorable or maintain a good level of stability dampened.\n\nRead Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nCrypto assets decouple from others\n\nInterestingly, 21Shares released an in-depth report of what went down in the sector across all levels. To start with, the largest suite of cryptocurrency Exchange Traded Products (ETPs), mentioned that macroeconomic factors remained in limbo despite the Fed interest hike to 25 basis points (bps).\n\nHowever, in September, the rate did not increase, leaving open the possibility of an interest hike in the latter months. On a Quarter-on-Quarter (QoQ) basis, Bitcoin decreased by 11.52% while Ethereum [ETH] fell by 13.60%. The S&P 500, which had a strong correlation with BTC and ETH at one point moved in the opposite direction, leading 21Share to conclude that,\n\n“Crypto has been historically negatively correlated with this index, signaling that investors view it as a risky asset class. However, as crypto expands on use cases, we are seeing increasing decorrelation within the asset class itself.”\n\nSolana beats Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nBut there was Solana [SOL], which faced numerous challenges and FUD lately, outperformed both Bitcoin and Ethereum. One of the major reasons for the token’s impressive performance was its partnership with payment platform Visa.\n\nAround September, the credit card giant announced that it had added support for the Solana blockchain for Circle [USDC] transactions. According to Visa, its decision to integrate Solana was because of the blockchain efficiency to process as high as 2,000 Transactions Per Second (TPS).\n\nConsequently, SOL price was the only part of the ecosystem positively affected. According to data shared by 21Shares, Solana’s Total Value Locked (TVL) also recorded a notable increase in the quarter.\n\nThe TVL measures the unique deposits of assets locked or staked in a protocol. When the TVL increases, it implies a rise in liquidity deposits into dApps under a protocol.\n\nConversely, a decrease suggests a dearth of liquidity. In Solana’s case, the increase means that market participants were back to trusting the project.\n\nOP and MKR had their times\n\nIt also seemed that it was only Solana which registered a 90-day increase in TVL out of the top project. However, two projects that could not be ignored all through the quarter were MakerDAO [MKR] and Optimism [OP].\n\nFor Optimism, its native token was able to maintain a 7.43% increase in the last 90 days. This hike could be linked to several developments that happened within the blockchain. For instance, there has been a surge in the adoption of the OP Stack among others.\n\nMKR, on the other hand, could boast a 79% hike in Q3, thanks to the increase in its annualized revenue and interest from Maker’s involvement with Real World Assets (RWAs). Ethereum also made some notable advancements in the quarter especially as it concerns staking and scaling solutions on the blockchain.\n\nEthereum and Chainlink days\n\nFor instance, to combat the centralization of the blockchain, Ethereum leveraged the Distributed Validator Technology (DVT). The DVT allows multiple node operators to run a single validator. This is done to reduce the risk of compromise associated with the validators without affecting the blockchain.\n\nFurthermore, the liquid staking sector continues to dominate the activity on the blockchain. According to the report, liquid staking accounted for 42.8% of all activity with Lido Finance [LDO] leading the cohort.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum has also delayed its next major upgrade, the Dencun upgrade, till next year. As per scaling on the blockchain, Eclipse, a customizable rollup provider introduced a modular scaling solution. Interestingly, this development brought Solana and Ethereum together.\n\n21Shares noted that,\n\n“In the context of Eclipse, the L2 architecture will use Ethereum for settlement, while leveraging Solana for execution on the back of its parallel processing capabilities for high performance.”\n\nAnother project that experienced major development in the quarter was Chainlink [LINK]. But this time, it introduced a study explaining how tokenization of world assets on the blockchain can improve adoption.\n\nAs shown above, Chainlink explained that the Cross Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) could help with the infrastructure for dollar stablecoins noting that,\n\n“The initiative is built around three pillars – educational content to facilitate understanding of the ecosystem, development of best practices and industry recommendations to promote a compliant industry, and actively work toward building on-chain infrastruct...'}]

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is experiencing fluctuations in price with a potential bearish trend in the short term. The increasing interest in ETH trading is evident from the rise in successful transactions, but caution is advised due to the sell trend indicated by the MACD signal.

The news analyst report highlights the positive short-term trend for Solana (SOL) due to recent price gains and network developments. However, concerns about long-term sustainability due to heavy subsidization of validators raise potential risks for SOL prices.

Based on the recent data, the open prices of ETH have been fluctuating between 22.69 and 23.84, with a decreasing trend overall. The total transactions and successful transactions have also been varying, indicating some volatility in market activity. The MACD signal consistently shows a sell indication, suggesting a bearish trend in the market. Therefore, it is likely that the price of ETH may continue to decrease in the near future. Investors should exercise caution and consider selling or holding their positions accordingly.

NEWS ANALYST REPORT:
"""
The news articles provide insights into the potential market trends for Ethereum (ETH) and related cryptocurrencies. The analysis suggests that Solana (SOL) is expected to see positive growth, with upgrades enhancing its functionality and partnerships driving its performance. Additionally, Chainlink (LINK) is facing challenges but remains a valuable asset for developers. The introduction of InQubeta (QUBE) as a decentralized finance platform focusing on artificial intelligence investments presents a unique opportunity for growth. Overall, the market trend for ETH and related cryptocurrencies appears to be positive, with SOL and QUBE showing potential for significant gains in the near future.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT:
"""
In reviewing my recent trading performance, it is evident that a conservative approach focusing on long-term strategies and risk management has been more successful in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. Effective strategies included prioritizing long-term growth potential over short-term gains and managing risks appropriately based on synthesized reports from on-chain, news, and reflection analysts. Ineffective strategies involved not fully considering potential risks and short-term fluctuations in the market. Key trends and indicators in the current cryptocurrency market that are likely to influence future trades include bearish trends in ETH, positive developments in the Solana ecosystem, and regulatory challenges in various projects. Given the market uncertainties, a conservative trading approach is warranted to mitigate risks and capitalize on sustainable growth opportunities.

Now, start your response with your brief reasoning over the given reports. Then, based on the synthesized reports, conclude a clear market trend, emphasizing long-term strategies over short-term gains. Finally, indicate your trading action as a 1-decimal float in the range of [-1,1], reflecting your confidence in the market trend and your strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the price of ETH is on a decreasing trend with a bearish indication from the MACD signal. This suggests that selling or holding positions may be more favorable in the near future. On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights positive growth potential for related cryptocurrencies like SOL and QUBE, indicating a more optimistic outlook for the market.

Reflecting on the importance of long-term strategies and risk management, it is evident that a conservative approach is more effective in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. By prioritizing long-term growth potential and considering key trends and indicators, traders can mitigate risks and capitalize on sustainable opportunities.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is advisable to take a cautious approach and prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains. While there may be positive growth potential for related cryptocurrencies, the bearish trend in ETH suggests a more conservative stance. Therefore, I would recommend a slight sell action with a confidence level of 0.3 to manage risk appropriately and align with the overall market trend.

*** ONCHAIN ANALYST RESPONSE ***
Based on the recent data, the ETH cryptocurrency has been experiencing a downward trend as indicated by the consistent "sell" signals from the MACD indicator. The open prices have been fluctuating between 22.69 and 23.56, with a slight decrease in successful transactions despite the total transactions remaining relatively stable. This could suggest a lack of strong buying interest in the market. Therefore, it is likely that the ETH price may continue to decline in the near future unless there is a significant change in market sentiment or trading activity.

As per Nansen, this increasing transaction and TVL demonstrate its potential for active economic activity.\n\nSandra, the Nansen analyst, also mentioned a couple of solutions by Solana. For instance, its fee markets and state compressions have addressed major issues in its technology stack.\n\nThe state compression reduced the cost of NFT minting by more than 2,000 times. Before this state compression, minting a million NFTs on the Solana network would cost the creator about $253,000. The compression led to a dramatic drop in the cost to merely $113.\n\nThe Nansen analyst compared Solana with minting a million NFTs on Ethereum or Polygon, which can cost over $33.6 million and $32.8k, respectively.\n\nThe rapid expansion of liquid staking within the Solana network, led by Marinade Finance, Lido Finance, and Jito_sol, was prominently emphasized in the discussion. Nevertheless, despite the substantial growth in Solana’s liquid staking protocols, the report acknowledges that there is still significant potential for further expansion, as only approximately 3% of staked SOL is currently allocated to these protocols.\n\nFurthermore, the analysts mentioned a growing interest in enterprise adoption and payment rails following Visa’s integration of USDC settlement on the Solana blockchain. The Visa USDC integration mainly aimed to bring faster finality and high throughput at virtually negligible costs to users.\n\nOne of the tweets also mentioned potential growth factors, saying,\n\n“Other potential tailwinds for Solana include increased enterprise adoption, success in implementing the Firedancer vision, and growing consumer-facing applications leveraging Solana’s advantages.”\n\nThe report also notes that Solana has been gaining the attention of consumer-facing apps. It praised Solana’s tech feats, potential partnerships, and infrastructure apps, all indicative of its promise.\n\nPotential Challenges on the Horizon\n\nAfter highlighting some of these positives of Solana, the report noted that there are still challenges, including the uncertainty of FTX/Alameda’s SOL holdings. Negative news on these holdings will be a temporary barrier to the growth of SOL.\n\nStill, about 71.8 million SOL, equal to $1.16 billion, is locked on FTX – about 17% of SOL’s circulating supply and 13% of its total supply. These SOL tokens’ outcome and eventual release will potentially impact the token’s future.\n\nAs per recent reports, around 9.1 million SOL belonging to Alameda Research were unstaked, causing the current price plunges.\n\nSolana’s price action was also possibly another challenge, with the assets trading in the red for the entire year. However, a look at the price since January suggests that SOL began the year trading at around $10 and currently sits above $20.'}, {'id': 7, 'time': 'Sun, 08 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'How to Buy Crypto With Monzo Bank - Watcher Guru', 'content': 'Amid the growing popularity of digital assets, there is an overwhelming need to understand the regulatory standards. Moreover, this includes knowing whether or not you are able to purchase digital assets with your specific financial institution. With regions differing in how they approach the industry, we break down how to buy crypto with Monzo Bank.\n\nMonzo is an online banking company that provides financial services for a host of customers. The company provides personal banking and financial services to those with a Monzo bank account, which is based in the United Kingdom. Yet, does Monzo even allow the purchase of crypto? Let’s delve a bit deeper.\n\nCan You Buy Crypto With Monzo Bank?\n\nSource: Bloomberg\n\nAlso Read: Bank of America Predicts the Future of the US Economy\n\nIf you are based in the United Kingdom, then you are likely well aware of Monzo Bank. They are a regulated bank in the region, and they service more than 7.4 million customers as of 2023 data. Subsequently, the bank itself has answered questions regarding the ability of users to purchase cryptocurrency with the bank.\n\nAccording to the bank, you cannot buy crypto directly from Monzo Bank. Specifically, the company states that in order to purchase digital assets as a Monzo Bank customer, “you can use a range of cryptocurrency exchanges to buy crypto as part of your personal banking with us.”\n\n“Like all regulated banks, from time to time we may block a small number of transactions based on risks,” the financial institution stated. “This applies to all transactions, not just those involving cryptocurrencies.\n\nTherefore, the ability to purchase crypto with a Monzo Bank account is certainly a possibility; it just requires an intermediary. Customers who utilize Monzo banking services will be able to purchase assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and more with a Monzo bank card as long as they first sign up for a cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nHow to Purchase Crypto With Monzo Bank?\n\nSource: Crypto News\n\nAlso Read: Crypto-Friendly Banks in Europe?\n\nAs previously mentioned, the only way to purchase crypto with a Monzo bank account is through a cryptocurrency exchange. However, as we have also stated, regulated exchanges are all dependent on where you are located.\n\nFor the purposes of Monzo Bank users, you would be located in the United Kingdom. Therefore, you must sign up with a cryptocurrency exchange in the UK in order to utilize British Pounds (GBP) for your digital asset purchases. Because Monzo doesn’t directly handle crypto, you will be forced to utilize their banking features alongside an exchange.\n\nThe most popular option for your crypto exchange needs would be eToro. Specifically, this option is most beneficial because it is an FCA-regulated platform that accepts British Pound deposits. Indeed, with eToro, you will be able to make your purchases directly from your Monzo application.\n\nThe platform will allow you to invest in more than 3,000 digital assets and other asset classes. Additionally, the processes are rather simple, as eToro makes it easy to sing up and start trading.\n\nFirst, you will need to conduct any verification requirements with the platform. Secondly, you will navigate to the deposit screen. Then, you would select the British pound as your currency in order to start the transfer process. Finally, you will complete the deposit and start purchasing the digital asset of your choosing.\n\nWhat Are the Fees?\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum Faces Inflationary Pressures Amid Plunge in Network Fees\n\nAn important part of investing and working through exchanges is understanding what fees you are in for. This is especially important as you embark on your digital asset investment journey alongside Monzo and a prominent crypto exchange.\n\nThere are a lot of fees that you should come to expect as you start investing. Moreover, these can range from withdrawal fees to transaction fees and pricing spreads. However, something that makes eToro a viable investment option is that it remains one of the most cost-effective platforms on the market.\n\nThe platform gives users the opportunity to invest with affordable deposits, helping Monzo users get into the practice. Moreover, they lead the industry in fees with a 1% spread and no commission cost. Therefore, it is ranked ahead of a platform like Coinbase, which offers spread fees that can surpass the 2% mark.\n\nConclusion\n\nAlthough Monzo Bank does not directly work with digital assets, you can still purchase crypto with them as your banking provider. The company understands the growing industry and doesn’t shy away from its popularity among its customers. Moreover, recognizing new options that are regulatory-compliant and present as a Monzo customer is a huge plus.\n\nThe bank has a working relationship with regulated companies and is seeking to point its users in the right direction. Subsequently, you can be sure that your digital asset investment journey with Monzo is in good hands.'}]

"""
REASONING:
Based on the reports provided by the on-chain analyst, news analyst, and reflection analyst, it is evident that the overall market trend for ETH is bearish, with a potential for further decline in the near future. The on-chain analysis indicates a downward trend in ETH, supported by sell signals in the MACD indicator and fluctuating open prices. The news analyst report highlights positive and negative aspects of the Solana ecosystem, with potential growth opportunities but also regulatory challenges. The reflection analyst emphasizes the importance of a cautious and conservative approach in navigating market uncertainties and capitalizing on sustainable growth opportunities.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is clear that a long-term strategy focused on risk management is crucial in the current market environment. Short-term gains may be overshadowed by the potential for further decline in ETH and regulatory challenges in the Solana ecosystem. Therefore, it is advisable to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains to navigate uncertainties and capitalize on potential growth opportunities while minimizing risks.

Given the bearish market trend for ETH and the mixed signals surrounding Solana, I would take a conservative approach and decide to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.7. This decision reflects my strategic choice to manage risk appropriately and prioritize long-term growth potential over short-term gains in the current market conditions.
ACTION:

DAILY RETURN:
0.0021695377549797445
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing a bearish trend with fluctuations in open prices and transaction volumes. This indicates a lack of significant market movement and potential for further decline in the near future. 

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights the negative impact of illicit activities on Thorswap, leading to a plummet in RUNE, while also pointing out positive developments in the Solana ecosystem. The growth in NFT and liquid staking sectors of Solana suggests a potential resurgence for the cryptocurrency, despite short-term uncertainty caused by the RUNE incident.

In line with the reflection analyst report, it is evident that a conservative approach focusing on long-term strategies and risk management is more successful in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. Short-term gains and not fully considering potential risks have proven to be ineffective strategies.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is advisable to adopt a conservative trading approach and prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains. The market trend appears to be bearish for ETH in the short term, but the positive developments in the Solana ecosystem could contribute to a bullish trend in the long term.

Therefore, I would take a cautious approach and assign a trading action of -0.5, reflecting my moderate confidence in the bearish trend for ETH in the short term and my strategic decision to manage risk appropriately by focusing on long-term growth opportunities.

Discover SCENE\n\nSAGE Labs, the browser-based sci-fi game experience on Solana from the Star Atlas team, saw over 2.29 million transactions on Sunday—surpassing the total for the entire Polygon network by about 256,000 transactions.\n\nAccording to data from analytics platform Flipside Crypto, Star Atlas’ SAGE Labs experience has seen over 16 million total transactions since it launched last month. The browser game is a fully on-chain experience, with nearly every interaction requiring the user to sign with their wallet on the Solana blockchain, triggering a small gas fee to verify each transaction.\n\nSAGE Labs is a 2D space management simulation experience that’s heavy on menus, simulated resource management tasks, and data—as opposed to being a 3D immersive gaming experience like the core Star Atlas MMORPG in development.\n\nSAGE Labs has liftoff!

By comparison, the entire Polygon network saw 2,037,330 transactions, according to data from blockchain explorer Polygonscan. Polygon is an Ethereum scaling network.\n\nUltimately, SAGE Labs transactions alone made up about 15% of all activity on the Solana network on October 8. But while SAGE Labs’ transaction tally may indicate a sizable player pool, digging into the data suggests otherwise.\n\nSAGE Labs saw 1,442 active players on Sunday, each making roughly 1,590 transactions apiece. That’s a staggeringly high number of transactions for one player—but it’s because of how the game was designed.\n\nThe spike in SAGE Labs activity has generated some social media attention, with Twitter users debating how exactly a single game is dwarfing an entire blockchain ecosystem.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt’s unclear, however, how many of these transactions might be from bots or automated accounts. Star Atlas developer ATMTA did not immediately respond to Decrypt’s request for comment regarding whether it is able to determine if any, or how many, of SAGE’s users might be bots or otherwise automating the experience.\n\nA Star Atlas representative previously told Decrypt via email that SAGE Labs is “unlike any other ‘Web3’ game out there” because “absolutely everything is done on-chain.” When more (or all) game elements require a player to sign a transaction with their wallet, it can add up—even with a relatively small player base.\n\nA game like SAGE Labs is different from other games that deploy NFTs because many blockchain games offer an optional crypto experience—meaning that players aren’t forced to connect a wallet or spend crypto to play.\n\nBut SAGE Labs requires a Solana-compatible wallet to play, as well as some SOL or Star Atlas’ ATLAS tokens in said wallet in order to create a character and progress through the experience.\n\nStar Atlas CEO Michael Wagner previously told Decrypt that developers can use SAGE Labs to build their own UI or modify the game’s mechanics to create their own experience.\n\nWhile SAGE Labs is seeing substantial traffic, Star Atlas has faced economic challenges this year. Back in July, it laid off 73% of its staff. At the time, Wagner told Decrypt that the layoffs were needed to adapt to the market conditions and to reduce overhead to “accommodate a long runway” for Star Atlas’ continued development.'}]

"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing a bearish trend with fluctuations in open prices and transaction volumes. This indicates a lack of significant market movement and potential for further decline in the near future. 

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights the negative impact of illicit activities on Thorswap, leading to a plummet in RUNE, while also pointing out positive developments in the Solana ecosystem. The growth in NFT and liquid staking sectors of Solana suggests a potential resurgence for the cryptocurrency, despite short-term uncertainty caused by the RUNE incident.

In line with the reflection analyst report, it is evident that a conservative approach focusing on long-term strategies and risk management is more successful in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. Short-term gains and not fully considering potential risks have proven to be ineffective strategies.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is advisable to adopt a conservative trading approach and prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains. The market trend appears to be bearish for ETH in the short term, but the positive developments in the Solana ecosystem could contribute to a bullish trend in the long term.

Therefore, I would take a cautious approach and assign a trading action of -0.5, reflecting my moderate confidence in the bearish trend for ETH in the short term and my strategic decision to manage risk appropriately by focusing on long-term growth opportunities.
ACTION:
-0.5

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights positive growth potential for related cryptocurrencies like SOL and QUBE, indicating a more optimistic outlook for the market.

Reflecting on the importance of long-term strategies and risk management, it is evident that a conservative approach is more effective in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. By prioritizing long-term growth potential and considering key trends and indicators, traders can mitigate risks and capitalize on sustainable opportunities.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is advisable to take a cautious approach and prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains. While there may be positive growth potential for related cryptocurrencies, the bearish trend in ETH suggests a more conservative stance. Therefore, I would recommend a slight sell action with a confidence level of 0.3 to manage risk appropriately and align with the overall market trend.

Reflecting on the importance of long-term strategies and risk management, it is evident that a conservative approach is more effective in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. By prioritizing long-term growth potential and considering key trends and indicators, traders can mitigate risks and capitalize on sustainable opportunities.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is advisable to take a cautious approach and prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains. While there may be positive growth potential for related cryptocurrencies, the bearish trend in ETH suggests a more conservative stance. Therefore, I would recommend a slight sell action with a confidence level of 0.3 to manage risk appropriately and align with the overall market trend.
ACTION:

In reflection of the reports, it is evident that prioritizing long-term strategies and risk management is crucial in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. While short-term gains may be tempting, a more conservative trading approach is warranted to manage risks effectively and capitalize on sustainable growth opportunities.

Considering the bearish trend in ETH and the potential growth in other cryptocurrencies like SOL and QUBE, I would recommend a cautious approach. Therefore, my trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.7, indicating a moderate level of confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.

Very simple kind of thing – let’s send money to each other in a cheap and fast way without [going] around the world.”\n\nAccording to Yakovenko, crypto assets could help simplify finance over the internet as well as let content creators work for themselves rather than be tied to the financial systems of their hosts.\n\n“[Crypto payments are] just such a better experience for anyone that generates user content. So the problem is that because it’s such a pain to deal with finance on the web, these platforms are able to aggregate power by creating these rails for a large number of content creators…\n\nThey own the content, they own the creator’s financial relationship between the creator and the user, they own that rail, they own that connection, and once they own it, the creator doesn’t want to leave – it’s like a kick in their revenues.

Considering recent improvements in Solana, this once-regulatory-despised convenience will soon be integrated. Version 1.16 of the protocol will also include other enticing features. Details!\n\nSolana on the Rise with Version 1.16\n\nSolana is experiencing a resurgence. The issuer of the SOL cryptocurrency recently witnessed a 4.15% increase in its total value locked (TVL) from Sunday to Monday. DefiLlama, a data provider, reported a figure close to $340 million just yesterday.\n\nSolana's new 1.16 update includes:\n\n\n\n– confidential transfers\n\n– better zk support\n\n– reduced hardware requirements\n\n\n\nthese are big improvements — I don't think enough people are aware\n\n\n\n(we need to get much better at communicating)\n\n\n\nwe wrote an overview:\n\nhttps://t.co/IxXdyGvluL — rpc mert | helius.dev (@0xMert_) October 5, 2023 Summary of the new features in Solana version 1.16 (SOL):\n\nHelius Labs’ article attached to this tweet complements Solana’s official communication dated September 26. In fact, a day before that, Solana Labs engineers confirmed to validators the imminent deployment of Solana v1.16. Its beta version will soon be integrated into the mainnet.\n\nBefore this announcement, the Solana team had to conduct numerous audits and address prior issues. It took about 10 months to reach this stage. Furthermore, the developers behind this v1.16 project acknowledge that it has not yet reached its zenith. They have promised the addition of more features over time.\n\nWhat are the updated features and performance improvements in this new iteration of Solana? Among other things, you’ll find:\n\nImproved support for execution for zero-knowledge math\n\nSupport for confidential SPL Token transfers\n\nSupport for 128 operations on elliptic curves (equivalents of EIP-196, EIP-197, and EIP-198)\n\nSupport for resizable program data accounts\n\nLedger data cleaning service optimization\n\nPeer-sampling improvements for Gossip request extraction\n\nDefault migration of account indexes to disk\n\nPrivacy over Anonymity for Crypto Traders\n\nHere’s how Helius Labs, a Solana infrastructure provider, described this feature:\n\n“Confidential transfers, a feature introduced by Token2022, use zero-knowledge proofs to encrypt SPL token balances and transaction amounts. The primary goal of this feature is to enhance user privacy with an emphasis on confidentiality rather than anonymity.”\n\nIn its development, Helius also highlighted that mathematical operations on encrypted amounts for these so-called “confidential” crypto transactions are based on Twisted EIGamal encryption. In validating these, Sigma protocols will be of great utility. These protocols fall under the category of ZK proofs where the prover can demonstrate to the verifier that they know secret information without revealing it.\n\nTo top it off, developers propose the addition of Command Line Interface (CLI) support.\n\nIt’s worth noting that the question of privacy and anonymity is Monero’s (XMR) domain. However, financial market regulators and central banks do not approve of this idea. Recently, the BIS has established “Atlas,” a platform that will strictly monitor cryptocurrency transactions.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

According to Santiment, the XRP coin has emerged as the most trending digital asset after its consecutive courtroom successes.\n\nThe XRP price surged to nearly $0.54 on October 5 following a judge’s dismissal of the SEC’s wish to appeal its initial loss in July. This legal momentum has reignited investor confidence. As a result, experts are now forecasting a potential surge in the price of XRP to $0.79 by December 2023.\n\nWith its legal battles slowly going behind it, XRP is charting an exciting path for the future. Thus making it a cryptocurrency to watch closely in the coming months.\n\n>>Register For The Tradecurve Markets Presale<<\n\nSolana (SOL): Achieves New Record\n\nSolana (SOL) is undeniably on an impressive uptrend, with capital inflows surging to nearly $24M in the week ending October 6. This is marking a level not seen since March 2022. Looking at the bigger picture, this remarkable momentum can be attributed to the launch of ether futures ETF products.\n\nDuring that week, the value of Solana rose to $24.42 – a price not achieved since August 2023. As more investors flock to its ecosystem, the Solana crypto has garnered significant attention for its high-performance blockchain. Therefore, market analysts are optimistic about its future, forecasting the Solana price to hover between $26.39 and $29.22 before 2023 ends.\n\nSolana’s rapid ascent and growing popularity indicate that it will remain a key player in the crypto space and a notable contender for future success.\n\nTradecurve Markets (TCRV): The Sizzle of the Presale\n\nWhile XRP and Solana are grabbing headlines, Tradecurve Markets (TCRV) has generated excitement with its scorching hot presale. The project is now in stage 6. With millions of TCRV native tokens sold, over 18,000 users onboarded, and $6.6M raised so far, the future for Tradecurve Markets looks bright.\n\nThis upcoming hybrid trading platform is poised to solve issues that have plagued the online trading market. For instance, some trading platforms like Binance or Coinbase only focus on cryptocurrencies, while others require multiple accounts. However, Tradecurve Markets will change this by allowing the trade of all derivatives from one account.\n\nAdditionally, concerns about data privacy and security are big. To solve this issue, Tradecurve Markets will eliminate sign-up KYC checks. This means traders can access the platform and start trading without disclosing personal information. As a result, users can enjoy a completely private trading environment.\n\nCurrently, TCRV is worth only $0.03. But, thanks to its low market cap and real-world connections to the forex market (valued at $753.2B in 2022 as per IMARC Impactful Insights), there’s an allure.\n\nFor more information about the Tradecurve Markets (TCRV) presale:\n\nVisit presale: https://app.tradecurvemarkets.com/sign-up\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Tradecurveapp\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it’s written by a third party.

Android values modularity: it runs on many different types of devices made by hundreds of manufacturers worldwide; Google only makes 1-2% of them. This approach made it the world’s most popular mobile operating system, with an estimated 60-75% market share.\n\nAndroid’s flexibility has been a boon for hardware companies making anything from smartphones to televisions, as they can bring new products to market without investing billions into building bespoke operating systems. However, such diversity also makes it more difficult to develop apps that seamlessly work across many devices with different specs, screen sizes, and the various versions of Android these devices run.”\n\nThe venture capital firm says that iOS has significant qualities that Android lacks, including a more consistent user experience.\n\n“By contrast, because Apple makes all iOS devices, it can provide users and developers with a more integrated and consistent experience. The time saved by not having to optimize across different devices can go into delivering better apps that users are willing to pay a premium for, and it’s not uncommon for companies to launch on iOS first as a result.\n\nSo, while Apple has just about a third of the market in terms of distribution, it does a much better job at capturing the value of its ecosystem with a whopping ~60% of all mobile spend, plus all the hardware revenue.”\n\nAccording to Placeholder Capital, Ethereum’s likeness to Android is helping to boost its layer-2 ecosystem.\n\n“Ethereum is similar to Android in that it’s quickly becoming more of a platform for third-party networks than the place where most end-users and developers operate.”\n\nSolana offers developers certain benefits over Ethereum, including speed and cost, according to the firm.\n\n“Solana is similar to iOS in how it values tightly integrated components in the name of throughput and performance. There’s much more to it – different consensus mechanisms and design principles – but ultimately, Solana as a single, unified network is much faster and cheaper than Ethereum and many other EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) networks.”\n\nDon't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Investors are taking notice.\n\nAfter carrying out The Merge last year, Ethereum (ETH 1.54%) has been one of the top-performing cryptos in 2023. It is up more than 30% over the first nine months of the year.\n\nHowever, a number of other cryptos with large market caps have turned in an even more impressive performance. For example, Solana (SOL 0.67%), an Ethereum rival, is up a stunning 128% year to date. So, should you be buying Solana instead?\n\nInstitutional asset flows\n\nTo help answer that question, consider what\'s happening with institutional asset flows in the crypto market right now. According to CoinShares, a digital-asset investment firm that tracks the weekly inflows and outflows of digital assets, Solana has become the altcoin of choice for institutional investors. Based on an analysis of digital asset flows, institutional investors appear to be moving their money out of Ethereum and into Solana.\n\nThe latest weekly numbers from CoinShares are stunning, to say the least. Out of the $78 million in net inflows, Solana received more than $24 million of the total. By way of comparison, Ethereum received $10.2 million and Bitcoin (BTC 1.13%) received $43 million. So, the net inflow of institutional investor funds into Solana was more than twice the amount that went into Ethereum.\n\nBy just about any back-of-the-envelope calculation, this shouldn\'t be happening. Given that Ethereum accounts for nearly 20% of the total capitalization of the crypto market, and Solana accounts for less than 1%, there\'s no reason to expect institutional investors to allocate so much of their portfolios to Solana. Still, here we are.\n\nAnd this is not a fluke, either. For the first 32 weeks of the year, Solana has seen net inflows in 28 of them, according to CoinShares. Moreover, net inflows into Solana are at their highest levels since March 2022. All of this suggests that momentum is continuing to build around Solana. At the same time, Ethereum continues to see net outflows and is losing momentum.\n\nSolana\'s long-term growth prospects\n\nThere are several factors that might explain new investor inflows into Solana. Perhaps institutional investors are behaving just like retail investors and are simply chasing performance. With Solana up 122% for the year, this is a distinct possibility.\n\nMoreover, investors might be seeking out altcoins that provide superior diversification benefits. Ethereum still tends to track Bitcoin\'s performance, while Solana is less correlated with Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, I think there\'s a much bigger factor at play here: Investors are finally waking up to the fact that Solana is superior to Ethereum as a blockchain in terms of rapid processing speed, low transaction fees, and massive throughput potential. Even after The Merge, Ethereum can still process only 15 to 20 transactions per second; Solana can theoretically process 65,000 transactions per second. That tremendous gap in speeds might help to explain why Visa recently partnered with Solana (and not Ethereum) on a new stablecoin payment project.\n\nTaking a big-picture view, Solana could finally be fulfilling its potential as a so-called "Ethereum killer." Ethereum is the past, and Solana is the future. There\'s something to be said for the fact that, even after The Merge, Ethereum is nowhere close to Solana\'s level of performance.\n\nIs Solana really the next Ethereum?\n\nSuppose you consider institutional investors to be the smart money. In that case, it\'s highly significant that they have been voting with their portfolios and moving money out of Ethereum and into Solana throughout 2023. Do they know something that we don\'t?\n\nWhile Ethereum has had a remarkable run since its launch in 2015, just about nobody is expecting it to replicate that type of performance. Since 2015, Ethereum is up 44,576.12%. Institutional investors might be looking for the next Ethereum to generate those types of otherworldly crypto gains, and have determined that Solana might fit the bill.\n\nI\'m increasingly bullish on Solana as a long-term investment. If it continues to line up big-ticket partners like Visa, then it has a legitimate chance to turn in some impressive long-term returns.'}, {'id': 10, 'time': 'Thu, 12 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Solana’s Game-Changing Update Empowers Privacy-Driven Transactions - The Currency Analytics', 'content': 'In a groundbreaking development for Solana (SOL), a prominent Ethereum (ETH) competitor, the network has unveiled a pivotal upgrade – the Solana v1.16 update. After nearly a year of rigorous development and testing, Solana’s network validators have overwhelmingly endorsed this transformational update. This major advancement heralds the introduction of confidential transfers for SPL tokens, the backbone of Solana’s token ecosystem, akin to Ethereum’s ERC-20 tokens.\n\nThe world of blockchain technology has just taken a giant leap toward enhancing user privacy and security. Solana’s latest innovation leverages zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs to encrypt not only the balances but also transaction amounts associated with SPL tokens. This move positions Solana as a pioneer in the realm of privacy-driven blockchain solutions, ensuring that user data remains confidential and secure.\n\nA Leap Towards Privacy and Security\n\nSolana, often touted as Ethereum’s formidable competitor, has marked a significant milestone in the evolution of blockchain technology. The unveiling of the Solana v1.16 update showcases the platform’s commitment to enhancing user privacy and security, bringing a new era of confidentiality to the realm of blockchain transactions.\n\nThis remarkable transformation introduces confidential transfers for SPL tokens, Solana’s equivalent to Ethereum’s widely known ERC-20 tokens. What makes this update particularly innovative is the integration of zero-knowledge proofs (ZK proofs) to protect user data. Notably, this encryption extends to SPL token balances and transaction amounts, effectively rendering it nearly impossible for third parties to intercept or decipher sensitive information.\n\nWith this upgrade, Solana cements its status as a pioneer in the field of privacy-driven blockchain solutions, prioritizing the protection of user data and fostering a secure environment for transactions.\n\nThe Solana Network: A Swift and Scalable Contender\n\nSolana is renowned for its impressive transaction speeds and scalability, making it a strong contender in the blockchain space. With the introduction of confidential transfers, the network is taking a giant leap forward in empowering user privacy. This development aligns with Solana’s core principles of delivering an efficient and secure blockchain ecosystem.\n\nThe utilization of zero-knowledge proofs is at the heart of this transformative upgrade. Zero-knowledge proofs, often abbreviated as ZK proofs, are advanced cryptographic techniques that enable data to be proven without revealing the actual data. In the context of Solana, this technology is leveraged to safeguard SPL token balances and transaction amounts, rendering them impervious to external surveillance and interference.\n\nThe adoption of ZK proofs, combined with Solana’s speed and scalability, opens new doors for blockchain users. This trifecta of traits, speed, scalability, and privacy, ensures that Solana stands at the forefront of blockchain innovation, promising a secure and efficient platform for decentralized transactions.\n\nThe Significance of Confidential Transfers\n\nConfidential transfers are a game-changer in the blockchain industry. They address one of the most pressing concerns for users – the privacy and security of their transactions. While blockchain is celebrated for its transparency and security, it can fall short when it comes to keeping sensitive user data confidential.\n\nSolana’s decision to introduce confidential transfers for SPL tokens is a significant step in the right direction. This update not only enhances the privacy of transactions but also ensures that the transaction amounts and token balances remain confidential. The significance of this development cannot be overstated, as it provides users with a level of data security that was previously difficult to attain within the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nThis move positions Solana as a trailblazer in the privacy-driven blockchain space, creating ripples throughout the industry and setting new standards for user data protection.\n\nZero-Knowledge Proofs: The Guardians of Privacy\n\nAt the heart of Solana’s groundbreaking upgrade are zero-knowledge proofs (ZK proofs), a cryptographic marvel that allows data to be verified without revealing the actual data itself. ZK proofs are the linchpin of this innovative approach to enhancing blockchain privacy, enabling the network to shield user data from prying eyes.\n\nZero-knowledge proofs work by allowing a party, known as the prover, to demonstrate that they possess certain knowledge without revealing the knowledge itself. In the case of Solana, this means that transaction amounts and SPL token balances can be verified as accurate without exposing the precise details of these transactions.\n\nThis level of privacy protection is a game-changer for blockchain users. It means that transactions on the Solana network are not only fast and efficient but also highly secure and confidential. The use of ZK proofs ensures that...'}]

Based on the recent data, the ETH cryptocurrency has been experiencing a downward trend with decreasing open prices and total transactions. The MACD signal has consistently been indicating a sell trend, suggesting a bearish market sentiment. However, the most recent open price of 21.83 and the MACD signal turning to buy could potentially indicate a reversal in the trend. It is important to monitor the market closely to see if this uptrend continues or if it is just a temporary fluctuation.

SOL’s performance has been poor recently, with its current price at $21.36, down by 8.4% in the past week, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nThis decline may be linked to its frequent mentions in Bankman-Fried’s trial, in which his lawyer, Mark S. Cohen, discussed his interest in this cryptocurrency during the trial.\n\nSOL serves as the currency for transactions on the Solana blockchain, which developers use to create decentralized apps like DeFi lending platforms.

The fake post was shared over X, formerly Twitter, and spread like wildfire.\n\n“Geesh, as the leader of the Solana Soldiers, this hurts my heart,” disgraced crypto influencer Ben Armstrong tweeted, asking if the quotes were legitimate.\n\n“Imagine building on top of this garbage,” Bitcoin maximalist Samson Mow added, reposting the fake post.\n\nIf the fake post was able to gain traction, it’s because of the close relationship Solana and Bankman-Fried used to have.\n\nFTX overhang\n\nAt its peak, “Sam’s [SOL] stash was worth maybe $12 billion,” writes Michael Lewis in his new book, “Going Infinite: The Rise and Fall of a New Tycoon.”\n\nIn fact, Lewis writes that Bankman-Fried owned anywhere between 10% and 15% of the entire SOL supply through Alameda and FTX. Solana ecosystem tokens became casually known as “Sam coins” in the crypto space.\n\nThat’s one of the reasons crypto investors panicked when in September the FTX bankruptcy team obtained court approval to liquidate $3.4 billion worth of crypto assets — including over $1 billion in SOL tokens.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nBut Bankman-Fried’s downfall didn’t spell the end for Solana development.\n\n“None of the builders I know viewed FTX as an existential catastrophe,” Rooter, the pseudonymous co-founder of lending protocol Solend, told DL News in August. “All of the fundamentals that brought us here — cheap fees, fast transactions, a strong ecosystem — were still there.\n\n“Just lost a very good exchange with Solana support, but there were others,” they said.\n\n$400,000 bug bounty\n\nThe fake Ellison post also referenced an issue that has recurrently plagued Solana — system shutdowns. It also suggested a potential vulnerability within the network, a claim that could have serious implications if true.\n\n“There’s a $400,000 reward for anyone that can find code that can turn off Solana,” wrote Solana Foundation head of developer relations Jacob Creech on Thursday in response to the fake Ellison post. “Please go ahead and find it.”\n\nThe reward was launched last month — alongside bounties for potential consensus violations or potential loss of funds — to encourage hackers to report network vulnerabilities to the Solana development team.\n\nThe bug bounty would be awarded for demonstrations of instances where the consensus comes to a halt and requires human intervention, according to the description. Additionally, vulnerabilities pertaining to eclipse attacks and remote attacks that result in network partitioning are also eligible for the reward.\n\nThe bounty fee would be paid in Solana’s native token SOL and would be locked for a year.\n\nSolana hasn’t experienced any outages since February — its longest period of uninterrupted uptime since March 2021.\n\nThe company behind Solana has attributed the improved performance to a series of upgrades meant to address its outage problem, including Ethereum-like fee markets that allow users to pay higher transaction fees in exchange for priority in the transaction queue.\n\nEkin Genç is the managing editor of DL News.

The cities of Carlsbad and Encinitas declared local emergencies over the last year after they each experienced a tragic collision that resulted in the death of an e-biker.\n\nThe Solana Beach City Council has also been discussing the parameters of a citywide ordinance aimed at improving safety for riders on bicycles and e-bikes, as well as other road users.\n\nThe San Diego County Sheriff has also made e-bike enforcement a focal point, especially for the safety of children riding e-bikes to and from school.\n\n“We feel really drawn to this part of the community,” said Braddock, who lives in Encinitas with his wife Hannah and their two daughters Maggie, 4, and Hazel, 2. “We feel like this is a part of our community where we, ourselves being cyclists and e-bike commuters, can really provide perspective and value right now.”\n\nThe team at Arendsen Braddock Personal Injury provides clients with a thorough handling of their cases from injury to resolution. They not only deal with the complicated insurance claims process helping to maximize available resources to provide care and support to the injured party, but can also help their clients find care when there is no insurance available or resources to pay for expensive doctor’s appointments and medical procedures.\n\n“Bicycle accidents, especially e-bike accidents, can be somewhat nuanced, and there are sometimes just questions of wrong and right that aren’t easy to answer. We’re able to come in and help answer those questions, and we do so by maintaining a team of experienced attorneys, investigators and accident reconstruction experts that we bring whenever we come onto a case.”\n\nWith two daughters ages 4 and 2, Braddock also said it’s important to advocate for safety measures. “At the end of the day, I think every parent’s purpose in life is to be doing everything we can to make sure our kids come home safe at the end of each day.”\n\nA new state law led to the recent creation of an e-bike safety program. Another proposed law that could be approved next year, AB 530, would create a licensing system that requires e-bike riders to take an online written test and have a state-issued identification. It would also ban children under age 12 from riding e-bikes.\n\n“Children don’t know all the dangers they need to be aware of, it’s just entirely a matter of exposure and experience,” Braddock said. “In the early stages of riding, they don’t have enough situational experience to know what dangers to be on the lookout for and can oftentimes think that someone else is going to be looking out for them – so it is important to supplement this lack of experience with as much training as possible.”\n\nArendsen Braddock Personal Injury is located at 535 N.

Additionally, predictions of a potential price surge for SOL based on past performance and institutional backing suggest bullish sentiment.

Thereafter, a crypto analyst with the X username ashpool soon identified the FTX exchange to be behind this whale transaction.\n\nUsing data from gelato.sh, ashpool revealed that the FTX exchange had delegated the said 5.5 million SOL to the Figment staking service, an active validator on the Solana network.\n\nIn September, the management of the bankrupt crypto exchange obtained court approval to liquidate its crypto holdings, valued at $3.4 billion, as they look to pay off their creditors.\n\nSolana accounts for the largest part of FTX’s crypto assets, with the exchange reportedly owning 55.8 million SOL, worth $1.16 billion.\n\nHowever, the majority of this SOL are currently staked, with FTX reportedly having access to 7 million SOL as of September, most of which had been sold off.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nSOL Price Prediction: Will Correction Trend Push Solana Under $20? 7 months ago\n\nOn October 6, 9.1 million SOL, worth about $212 million, owned by Alameda Research – FTX’s defunct trading wing – were reportedly unstaked, prompting new fears of market sell-off by the FTX estate.\n\nHowever, FTX’s latest move to stake 5.5 million SOL shows the exchange is holding on to its SOL investments for now, which could be interpreted as a reassuring move for traders with fears of liquidation.\n\nDespite its bankrupt status, FTX is still considered a major player in the Solana ecosystem, owning 10% of SOL’s total supply. In addition to its SOL holdings, FTX also owns 20,500 BTC worth $560 million and 112,600 ETH, worth $192 million, among other crypto assets.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nSOL Up By 16% In One Month\n\nIn other news, SOL is up by 16.06% in the last months despite fears of liquidation and worrying factors linked to the FTX exchange.\n\nMost recently, there were circulating rumors that the defunct exchange could “switch off” the Solana blockchain if it found the need to liquidate the long position of traders.\n\nHowever, these rumors were soon debunked by multiple accounts as fake. In fact, Jacob Creech, Head of Developers at Solana, drew the community’s attention to the fact there is a $400,000 SOL bounty for anyone who can find a “switch off” for the network.\n\nAt the time of writing, SOL is trading at $21.98, with a 2.34% gain in the last day. Meanwhile, the token’s daily trading volume is up by 10.18% and is valued at $267.07 million.\n\nSOL trading at $21.93 on the hourly chart | Source: SOLUSDT chart on Tradingview.com\n\nFeatured image from Cryptodose, chart from Tradingview'}, {'id': 12, 'time': 'Sat, 14 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Solana (SOL) Faces Challenges Amidst Ex-CEO’s Trial - The Currency Analytics', 'content': 'In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency, Solana (SOL), once a favored digital asset on FTX, finds itself in a challenging spot as it dips in value. The recent downturn in SOL’s fortunes can be partly attributed to the ongoing trial of Sam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO of the crypto brand.\n\nSolana, currently the eighth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has witnessed a decline in its value. As of this writing, SOL is priced at $21.19, reflecting a 3% drop in the past 24 hours and a more substantial 7% decline over the past week, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\nThe connection between SOL’s performance and Bankman-Fried’s trial may not be coincidental. The cryptocurrency has been frequently mentioned during the legal proceedings. In a recent development, Mark S. Cohen, the lawyer representing Bankman-Fried, discussed his client’s interest in SOL.\n\nSOL is the native digital asset used for transactions on the Solana blockchain, a platform that empowers developers to create decentralized applications (dApps) with a particular focus on decentralized finance lending protocols.\n\nSolana’s Recent Struggles\n\nSolana, often referred to as SOL, has encountered a series of challenges that have impacted its market performance. Its current position as the eighth largest cryptocurrency underscores its importance in the digital asset landscape. However, recent events, particularly the legal proceedings involving Sam Bankman-Fried, have cast a shadow on SOL’s performance.\n\nThe price of SOL has taken a hit, with a 3% drop in the last 24 hours and a more substantial 7% decline over the past week. This dip has raised concerns among investors and enthusiasts of the cryptocurrency market. The relationship between SOL’s decline and the ongoing trial is a subject of interest.\n\nThe Role of Sam Bankman-Fried\n\nSam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO of the crypto exchange FTX, has been at the center of attention due to his involvement in the crypto world. His trial, which is currently underway, has brought several aspects of his career and interests to light.\n\nBankman-Fried’s lawyer, Mark S. Cohen, recently mentioned his client’s enthusiasm for SOL, adding a layer of intrigue to the ongoing trial. The connection between the trial and SOL’s performance is an aspect that continues to captivate the crypto community.\n\nSolana and Its Utility\n\nSolana is a blockchain platform that provides a fertile ground for developers to create decentralized applications, commonly known as dApps. Among these applications, decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocols have taken center stage, demonstrating the versatility and potential of the Solana blockchain.\n\nThe native digital asset of Solana, SOL, plays a pivotal role in facilitating transactions and activities on the network. Its importance in the Solana ecosystem cannot be overstated, making it a subject of interest not only for developers but also for investors and traders in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nThe Impact on SOL’s Value\n\nThe recent downturn in SOL’s value raises questions about the cryptocurrency’s future. The connection to the trial of Sam Bankman-Fried has certainly affected market sentiment. Investors and traders are closely monitoring the situation, looking for clues that could help them navigate this challenging period.\n\nThe decline in SOL’s value may also be linked to the increased scrutiny and uncertainty surrounding the broader cryptocurrency market. As regulators and authorities across the globe seek to establish a regulatory framework for digital assets, cryptocurrencies are experiencing increased volatility.\n\nThe Broader Cryptocurrency Landscape\n\nThe world of cryptocurrencies is a dynamic and ever-changing one. While some digital assets have reached remarkable heights, they are not immune to market forces and external factors. The trial of prominent figures in the crypto space can have far-reaching effects on the assets they are associated with, as we are seeing in the case of Solana.\n\nSOL’s performance in recent days mirrors the broader cryptocurrency landscape, where the values of many digital assets are subject to fluctuations driven by market sentiment, news events, and regulatory developments.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nAs Solana navigates through these challenging times, the cryptocurrency community and investors are eager to see how its value will evolve. The outcome of Sam Bankman-Fried’s trial, coupled with the regulatory landscape, will likely play a significant role in shaping SOL’s future.\n\nThe broader lesson from SOL’s recent dip is a reminder that the cryptocurrency market is still maturing, and its participants must be prepared for a degree of uncertainty. While this volatility presents opportunities, it also underscores the importance of staying informed and cautious when engaging in the crypto space.\n\nIn conclusion, the challenges faced by Solana (SOL) in recent days have brought the spotlight onto the cryptocurrency market’s complexities.

So, it’s not beyond the realm of possibilities at all.\n\nBut what’s even more strange is we got above the 10% threshold already in the past.\n\nThis is the SOL upside chart… You can see here the yellow line is the 10% of ETH market cap, and the Solana price in blue breached that back in October 2021.”\n\nAt time of writing, SOL is trading for $21.99.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Detailed Analysis - CoinGape', 'content': 'Recently, the price of Solana (SOL) increased by 7.56% within 24 hours, surpassing Binance Coin Price (BNB) in market cap briefly. At that time, SOL’s market cap was $49.36 billion, slightly larger than BNB’s $48.5 billion, securing the third position according to CoinMarketCap data. However, as of the current moment, BNB has regained its position, now surpassing SOL by 2.25%. Over the past day, Solana has consistently traded above the $100 mark.\n\nBeyond its market fluctuations, Solana boasts various real-world applications including Web3 gaming, NFTs, DeFi, and opportunities for crypto-earning. This article will explore whether investing in Solana in 2024 is a wise decision\n\nadvertisement\n\nOverview of Solana\n\nSolana is one of the supposed “Ethereum Killer” blockchain projects improving upon the limitations like high gas fees and slower transactions.\n\nUnlike other existing blockchain networks, Solana runs based on Proof-of-History (PoH) consensus mechanism. This enabled the network to achieve a high throughput of 50,000 transactions per second (TPS), while still maintaining the security and scalability of the network.\n\nThe ultra-fast transactions combined with the low fees are the reasons why Solana is considered an Ethereum killer. It is one of the few blockchains that partnered with Visa for USDC settlements in September 2023.\n\nMoreover, Solana is the only blockchain that released a Web3 smartphone and remained at the forefront of blockchain innovation. Since its launch, many blockchain applications such as NFTs, dApps, DeFi lending protocols, Web3 games, and applications are being developed on the Solana network.\n\nPrice History of Solana (SOL) Coins\n\nThe Solana coin, SOL, was launched in March 2020 with a starting price of $0.98 per coin. It traded sideways for a long time and then reached its first all-time high value of $56 in May 2021.\n\nAs the blockchain’s popularity and adoption grew with the introduction of new applications like blockchain gaming, its price continued to increase. Its unique features like ultra high TPS and low transaction fees combined with new use cases and institutional investments caused sharp price spikes in the following months.\n\nAs a result, SOL price increased by a whopping 12,000% in 2021 and reached $175 in September 2021. Adding to that, the total-value locked (TVL) on Solana also hit an all-time high of $5.73 billion.\n\nThe price rally continued and the Solana price went to as high as $260 in November 2021. However, the unfavorable market conditions combined with multiple network outages adversely affected SOL price in 2022.\n\nMajor crypto incidents such as the FTX crash and the prolonged crypto bear market also played a part in Solana reaching a bottom of $8.9 by the end of 2022. However, Solana price got back up and recorded a significant price surge by the end of 2023. It is only a matter of time before Solana gets back on its winning streak in the market in 2024.\n\nMarket performance of Solana\n\nAs of today, the price of Solana stands at $115.93, marking a decrease of 17.29% in its 24-hour trading volume, which currently sits at $2.2 billion. Despite this recent decline, Solana has experienced a notable increase of 14.05% within the last 24 hours. However, it is important to note that Solana is still trading at a significant 55.33% below its all-time high of $260.06, which was reached on November 7, 2021.\n\nIn terms of market ranking, Solana currently holds the 5th position on CoinMarketCap, boasting a live market capitalization of $50.5 billion. With a circulating supply of 437.4 billion SOL coins, Solana has demonstrated impressive price movements, with a maximum increase of 13.53% over the past 7 days and a staggering 414.50% increase over the course of the past year.\n\nThe reason for SOL’s upward trend is attributed to airdrops, the network’s capacity to offer a cheaper and more user-friendly option compared to its rivals, and a high momentum rally in Bitcoin.

In return, holders who participate in staking receive rewards in the form of additional coins. This process plays a vital role in securing proof-of-stake (PoS) networks, such as Ethereum and Solana.\n\nIn August, the FTX’s current leadership helmed by John J.

It was more liquid than the other Sam coins,” Caroline Ellison, the former CEO of FTX’s sister trading firm Alameda Research and the star witness at the ongoing trial of SBF, said last week in court.\n\nNotably, Solana was also FTX’s largest crypto holding at the time of the September court ruling, with as much as $1.16 billion in SOL sitting in the company’s wallets.'}, {'id': 13, 'time': 'Mon, 16 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Solana Foundation joins Dubai's Crypto Centre - The Block", 'content': "Ryan is a senior editor at TechForge Media with over a decade of experience covering the latest technology and interviewing leading industry figures.

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
The news articles indicate a mixed sentiment towards Solana within the cryptocurrency market. On one hand, the partnership between the Solana Foundation and DMCC Dubai shows a positive development for Solana's ecosystem, potentially increasing adoption and innovation. However, the decision by Lido to exit Solana due to lack of funds and community support may raise concerns about the platform's sustainability and attractiveness to investors. Additionally, FTX's bankruptcy estate staking a significant amount of Solana and Ethereum tokens could signal confidence in these assets. Overall, the market trend for Solana may experience some volatility in the short term as investors assess these developments and their impact on the platform's future prospects.

NEWS ANALYST REPORT:
"""
The news articles indicate a mixed sentiment towards Solana within the cryptocurrency market. On one hand, the partnership between the Solana Foundation and DMCC Dubai shows a positive development for Solana's ecosystem, potentially increasing adoption and innovation. However, the decision by Lido to exit Solana due to lack of funds and community support may raise concerns about the platform's sustainability and attractiveness to investors. Additionally, FTX's bankruptcy estate staking a significant amount of Solana and Ethereum tokens could signal confidence in these assets. Overall, the market trend for Solana may experience some volatility in the short term as investors assess these developments and their impact on the platform's future prospects.
"""

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT:
"""
In reflecting on recent trading performance, it is evident that a cautious and strategic approach focusing on long-term growth opportunities and effective risk management has been successful. Monitoring market trends and indicators like MACD has led to profitable outcomes, despite short-term fluctuations resulting in losses. Moving forward, it is important to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains in the volatile cryptocurrency market. Key trends to consider include potential reversals in market trends for ETH, mixed outlooks on other cryptocurrencies like Solana, and the importance of managing risks effectively. A slightly bullish stance with a moderate level of confidence in market trends may be warranted to capitalize on growth opportunities while mitigating risks.

The announcement came through Creech\'s Twitter post on 13th October 2023. The bounty is part of Solana\'s bug bounty program aimed at discovering and rectifying critical vulnerabilities to ensure the network\'s robustness and security.\n\nBounty for Liveness Loss\n\nThe specific bounty of $400,000 is categorized under "Liveness / Loss of Availability" in Solana\'s Security Bug Bounties program, which covers incidents where consensus halts and requires human intervention including eclipse attacks, remote attacks partitioning the network. The reward is paid in locked SOL tokens with a lockup period of 12 months.\n\nReporting and Response Process\n\nSolana has a well-defined process for reporting, reviewing, and addressing security issues. Individuals discovering a potential vulnerability are instructed to report it through a designated "Report a Vulnerability" link rather than creating a GitHub issue. The Solana Labs team typically responds within 72 hours, following which a triage and fix preparation process ensues. Once a fix is ready, it\'s communicated to the network validators using the "Solana Red Alert" notification system, ensuring a coordinated effort to address the vulnerability.\n\nBesides the aforementioned category, Solana\'s bug bounty program includes other categories like "Loss of Funds," "Consensus/Safety Violations," and "DoS Attacks," with rewards ranging from $100,000 to $2,000,000. These bounties reflect Solana\'s commitment to maintaining a secure and reliable blockchain network by incentivizing the discovery and reporting of potential security threats.\n\nEligibility and Payment\n\nTo be eligible for the bounty, submissions must include an exploit proof-of-concept. The Solana Foundation has outlined a clear process, including KYC (Know Your Customer) procedures and a participation agreement that needs to be adhered to by the participants. The bounties are awarded on a rolling or weekly basis, and are paid out within 30 days upon receipt of an invoice, with the SOL/USD conversion rate being determined by the market price of SOL at the end of the day the invoice is submitted.\n\nIn summary, the Solana Foundation\'s proactive stance towards identifying and rectifying potential security threats through substantial bounties reflects its continuous effort to uphold network integrity and ensure a secure blockchain environment for its users and developers.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock\n\n. . .\n\nTags'}, {'id': 10, 'time': 'Tue, 17 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Lido DAO Votes to Sunset the Lido on Solana Project - CryptoPotato', 'content': 'The Lido on Solana project will wind down following the inability of the P2P team to sustain the project due to financial constraints.\n\nAccording to the team, the sunsetting of the project will happen over the coming months, with stSOL token holders given until February 2024 to unstake through the Lido on the Solana frontend.\n\nLido Discontinues Liquid Staking on Solana\n\nThe decision for Lido to cease its liquid staking solution on the Solana blockchain comes after an “extensive DAO discussion and community vote,” according to an announcement on Monday, Oct. 16, 2023.\n\nBased on results from a snapshot, over 92% of Lido token holders voted in support of sunsetting the Lido on Solana protocol, while just over 7% voted to provide funding to the project.\n\nP2P validator, the team behind the development of Lido on Solana, previously proposed two scenarios to community members – fund the project with $1.5 million to sustain operations or exit the Solana blockchain.\n\nYuri Mediakov of P2P, who put forth the proposals, listed project and business developments, along with profit and losses. Mediakov said the team invested about $700,000 into development and support but got a revenue of $220,000, thereby making a loss of $484,000.\n\nThe proposal, meanwhile, stated at the time that if the community voted for the sunsetting option, the team would need $20,000 monthly in support from the Lido DAO for technical maintenance for five months, beginning from Sept. 4, 2023.\n\nAn excerpt from the latest announcement reads:\n\n“After much discussion and a vote by Lido DAO members, it was decided that the best course of action would be to wind down Lido on Solana. Whilst this decision was difficult in the face of numerous strong relationships across the Solana ecosystem, it was deemed a necessity for the continued success of the broader Lido protocol ecosystem.”\n\nSOL Staking Stops With Immediate Effect\n\nThe sunsetting process will happen in phases, with staking on Solana discontinued with immediate effect, while node operators can begin voluntary off-boarding from Nov. 17, 2023.\n\nAlso, stSOL token holders will continue to receive rewards throughout the winding down process, but unstaking via the Lido on the Solana frontend will stop by Feb. 4, 2024. Holders who miss the deadline will have to unstake through the Command Line Interface (CLI).\n\n“The journey with Lido on Solana protocol has been momentous, filled with challenges overcome and milestones celebrated. While this marks the end of this particular chapter, the optimism of Lido contributors for the future of Solana remains undiminished.”\n\nIn addition to its exit from the Solana blockchain, Lido also previously wound down liquid staking operations on Kusama and Polkadot.'}, {'id': 9, 'time': 'Tue, 17 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Solana loses $100 million in TVL over 24 hours after Lido bids farewell - FXStreet', 'content': 'Solana\'s Total Value Locked (TVL) experienced a drop of $100 million in a single day on Tuesday.\n\nLido Finance, a liquid staking provider, announced its intention to discontinue on Solana.\n\nSolana\'s TVL decreased from $313 million to $210 million despite positive price action.\n\nSolana\'s Total Value Locked (TVL) took a substantial hit on Tuesday, plummeting by $100 million in just one day.

The statement said, "The sunsetting of the Lido on Solana protocol was approved by Lido token holders and the process will begin shortly."\n\nThe decision stemmed from a P2P Validator proposal that outlined Lido\'s challenges and future prospects on Solana.\n\nThe DAO discussed if they can continue Lido on Solana with the treasury\'s backing or discontinue it.\n\nFollowing the discussion, users of Lido\'s staking services on Solana (stSOL holders) will reportedly receive network rewards throughout the discontinuation. stSOL holders can also unstake with Lido having shut down new stakes on Monday.

The liquidity-staking dApp dominates around $56.4 million of Solana\'s entire TVL, but it has seen a positive 7% addition in the last 24 hours.\n\nSolana TVL\n\nSolana\'s TVL decline coincided with Lido Finance\'s decision to sever ties with the platform. This comes despite Solana experiencing a positive price movement over the last 24 hours.\n\nLido’s TVL change\n\nAs of the time of writing, Solana (SOL) is trading close to $24, fluctuating within the $22 to $24 daily range. CoinGecko reports a 24-hour trading volume of $900 million, signifying a 9% price increase in the past day and a similar increase over the past week. With a circulating supply of 420 million SOL, Solana boasts a market cap of $9.9 billion.\n\nThe substantial loss of TVL on Solana has to be monitored as there are no other apparent factors to account for at the moment. This is especially true as Solana recorded a TVL increase over the last week despite a sluggish altcoin market. Its strong price action is a positive for the chain in the short term.'}]

Despite this setback, there are positive developments and potential bullish catalysts for Solana, such as mainstream attention, key program developments, and partnerships, which could contribute to its resilience and growth in the long term.

Drift protocol, a Solana-based perpetual swap trading project, is the latest among them.\n\nAccording to on-chain data from the blockchain analytics platform DeFiLlama, the Drift protocol has now locked in a new total value locked (TVL) of $20.16 million.\n\nSource: DeFiLlama\n\nWhat is Drift Protocol?\n\nLaunched in 2021 by Cindy Leow, Drift Protocol emerged as an open-source decentralized exchange (DEX) that facilitates non-custodial trading to users. The platform also enables users to borrow, lend, stake, and swap cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe project is backed by the crypto-focused investment firm Multicoin Capital, which led a $3.8 million seed funding for the DEX in October 2021.\n\nDrift protocol presently runs its version 2 (v2), a sequel to the project’s v1 providing enhanced liquidity, market making, and collateralization to improve trading experience.\n\nWhile unveiling Drift v2 last year, the protocol added that Drift v1 attracted over 15,000 cumulative users and more than $10 billion in trading volume within six months.\n\nDrift Protocol Attains New TVL\n\nDrift Protocol’s latest milestone follows a three-month steady increase in TVL, going from $11.8 million in August to its current valuation. The project’s achievement can be attributed to an increase in engagement with its service from investors.\n\nA factor that may be contributing to the increase is the addition of new trading tools to offer users a seamless trading experience. The latest among these tools is the Auto-confirm feature rolled out in collaboration with the crypto wallet provider Phantom.\n\nLike Drift, other Solana-based protocols are actively making waves within the crypto space. For example, Star Atlas, a space-themed gaming platform building on the Solana blockchain, accounted for over 15% of the daily trading volume of the network’s transactions earlier this month.\n\nThe impressive achievements of these projects have rubbed off on Solana’s overall performance.

This comeback holds significant importance, not only from a technical standpoint but also for its broader implications on a volatile crypto market. An analysis of the attached chart will elucidate some of the crucial aspects underlying this rebound.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the most notable elements on the chart is the potential for Solana to conquer the neckline resistance once more. For the uninitiated, the neckline resistance is a crucial point on the chart that acts as a threshold for bullish momentum. Historically, surpassing this point often indicates the potential for a sustained uptrend, hinting at further gains in the near future. In the case of Solana, this would mean a strong comeback from its recent lulls, reinforcing its position as a dominant player in the crypto space.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nFurthermore, keen observers might also anticipate the possibility of a "golden cross." This occurs when a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average, typically indicating a potential bullish breakout.\n\nSuch a move is often regarded as a significant buy signal among crypto enthusiasts and could potentially bring a flurry of investments into Solana. The daily chart, with its intertwining moving averages, suggests that such a crossover might be on the horizon. This development, combined with the breaching of the neckline resistance, paints an optimistic future for Solana.\n\nBeyond these technical indicators, it is crucial to recognize Solana\'s overarching position on the crypto market.

The price skyrocketed by over 16,800% in a year.\n\nSOL price chart:\n\n\n\nSource: coingecko.com\n\nWorth noting, however, was that the panelists’ predictions varied wildly. Among the most pessimistic was the CEO of the trading platform Coinmama, Sagi Bakshi, who indicated a price of USD 50 in 2030, saying he has “no idea if Solana will survive.”\n\nOn the opposite side of the spectrum was Daniel Cawrey, Chief Operating Officer at Cypherpunk Holdings, who predicted a price of USD 20,000 for 2030, saying “it scales better than ether and already has staking.”\n\nMeanwhile, crypto exchange Kraken also noted in a report today that “SOL has continued to attract increasingly greater attention from new and existing market participants – especially institutions.”\n\n“With SOL appearing to remain in what could be deemed its third wave of ‘price discovery,’ the case could be made that SOL climbs meaningfully higher into the near year,” the report said, suggesting a price target of USD 400 to 500 between December and the first quarter of next year.\n\n___\n\nWatch the full episode below:\n\n_____\n\nLearn more:\n\n– SOL Rallies on Strong Technicals, All-Time High in Total Value Locked\n\n– Solana Resists Selling as Details on Network Outage Emerge\n\n\n\n– Multi-Chain Future Brings Multiple Competitors to Bitcoin & Ethereum – Analysts\n\n– Ethereum, Solana, Polygon & Co Form A New Hot Market Of Blockchains\n\n\n\n– Ethereum Developers On Why They Don’t See Cardano & Binance Chain As Rivals\n\n– Solana Founder On Critical DeFi Challenges and How To Fix Them'}, {'id': 0, 'time': 'Thu, 19 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Solana vs. Ethereum: Renewed debate erupts over efficiency, development and scalability - FXStreet', 'content': 'Solana\'s energy consumption is at 658 joules per transaction against Ethereum\'s higher energy usage, sparking debate over which network works better.\n\nEthereum\'s robust developer community gives an advantage to the chain.\n\nThe two chains compete over scalability and intrinsic design constraints.\n\nCrypto developer who goes by the alias Ichigo on X, who is associated with Solana-based Helius Labs, has ignited another comparison between Ethereum and its smart chain competitor Solana. Ichigo pointed out that while the post-Merge Ethereum transactions use 144,000 joules of energy, Solana transactions require only 658 joules.\n\nSolana beats Ethereum in energy efficiency\n\nIchigo underscored Solana\'s energy efficiency by stating, "The average Solana transaction uses 658 Joules of energy. That’s less than a Google search. Few."\n\nYes because Solana is a single-threaded global state machine that\'s subject to fluctuating gas costs\n\n\n\nEthereum has inherent design limitations, which is why they had to move to the more modular approach of L2s.

It\'s… — Ichigo | helius.dev (@0xIchigo) October 18, 2023\n\nBoth Ethereum and Solana rely on proof-of-stake methods, which are considered more environmentally efficient. Therefore, they are often pitted against each other.\n\nIn terms of energy emissions, Solana Foundation became the first chain ever to allow real-term emission measurement earlier this year. Between April 2022 and March 2023, it reported that its 2,390 block-producing nodes had a total carbon footprint in the average emissions term of 10,651.2 tonnes CO2. Therefore, the energy per transaction comes to a mere 879 joules in the said time frame, close to the recent claims by Ichigo.\n\nBased on data provided by the Ethereum Foundation, an estimated 2,601 megawatt hour is the requirement by the network in terms of electricity, leaving carbon emissions of 870 tonnes CO2.\n\nEthereum there for the “long haul”\n\nDespite Solana\'s dominance in energy efficiency, Ichigo emphasized Ethereum\'s resilience and significance as a major player.\n\n"Ethereum will be around for the long haul - there are too many smart people working on it," Ichigo added in response to a user.\n\nThe influencer underlined that the involvement of developers and substantial financial activity within the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) makes it a long-term player. However, he anticipates that Ethereum may struggle with scaling compared to Solana given its single-threaded global state machine and fluctuating gas prices, making it less suitable for payment or decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.\n\nThe debate brings up the concept of modularity versus monolithic technology stacks, with Ichigo arguing that Solana\'s ground-up scalability-focused design contrasts with Ethereum\'s modular approach. This essentially has to do with how chains are built by taking into account speed, efficiency and flexibility.\n\nIn terms of support for decentralized finance applications, Solana dominates less than 1% of the total value locked in the crypto space. Meanwhile, Ethereum still dominates 53% of total TVL based on DeFiLlama data. While Ethereum supports 935 protocols, Solana houses 112 despite a rough year of public outages.\n\nAs per Token Terminal data, in the last 30 days, code commits that signify developer activity for Ethereum is at 1.28K while Solana is at 542.\n\nNonetheless, Solana has showcased its own strength with 81.49k daily active users over a 30-day average. Yet, it is still far from Ethereum\'s 324.21k daily active users.\n\nAn intriguing investment trend emerges, as Ethereum, despite its dominance, reports negative year-to-date flows amounting to $111 million based on CoinShares\' last report. Contrarily, Solana attracted positive inflows of $59 million during the same timeframe.\n\nThis disparity signals a shift in investor preference to Solana. However, Ethereum maintains its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency with a circulating market cap of $188.59 billion, with Solana far behind at $9.93 billion.\n\n\n\nSOL/ETH YTD chart\n\nIn the comparison between Solana and Ethereum, Solana emerges as the more energy-efficient network, with its carbon footprint and transaction energy usage significantly lower than that of Ethereum. However, Ethereum remains a formidable player, thanks to its strong developer community and substantial financial activity behind it. However, it might face scalability challenges compared to Solana, making the choice between the two networks dependent on specific use cases.'}]

You are an experienced ETH cryptocurrency trader and you are trying to maximize your overall profit by trading ETH. In each day, you will make an action to buy or sell ETH. You are assisted by a few analysts below and need to decide the final action.

ON-CHAIN ANALYST REPORT:
"""
Based on the recent data, the ETH cryptocurrency has shown a fluctuating trend in its open price, total transactions, and successful transactions. The MACD signal has switched between buy and sell multiple times, indicating a lack of clear direction in the market. The successful transactions have been relatively stable, but the total transactions have varied significantly. The recent sell signals suggest a potential bearish trend in the market, but further analysis is needed to confirm this. Traders should closely monitor the market for any potential shifts in momentum.
"""

NEWS ANALYST REPORT:
"""
The news articles suggest a positive outlook for Solana (SOL) in the cryptocurrency market. The price of SOL has shown resilience and potential for a rally, with indicators pointing towards renewed momentum and a possible bullish breakout. Additionally, the Solana-based DeFi protocol Drift has achieved a new total value locked (TVL) milestone, indicating increased engagement and adoption within the ecosystem. The comparison between Solana and Ethereum highlights Solana's energy efficiency and scalability advantages, potentially attracting investor preference. Overall, these developments indicate a bullish trend for SOL in the near future, with the potential for price appreciation and continued growth in the market.
"""

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT:
"""
In reflecting on recent trading performance, it is evident that a cautious and strategic approach focusing on long-term growth opportunities and effective risk management has been successful in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. Key indicators such as MACD signals, total transactions, and market sentiment towards specific cryptocurrencies like Solana have played a crucial role in decision-making. Moving forward, it is important to closely monitor market trends, particularly in relation to Solana's performance and advancements in the ecosystem. Given the potential for short-term corrections and volatility, a slightly conservative trading approach with a focus on long-term strategies is warranted to manage risks effectively and capitalize on growth opportunities.
"""

Now, start your response with your brief reasoning over the given reports. Then, based on the synthesized reports, conclude a clear market trend, emphasizing long-term strategies over short-term gains. Finally, indicate your trading action as a 1-decimal float in the range of [-1,1], reflecting your confidence in the market trend and your strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing fluctuations with mixed signals from the MACD indicator, suggesting a lack of clear direction. The news analyst report, on the other hand, highlights a positive outlook for Solana (SOL) with indicators pointing towards a potential bullish breakout and continued growth in the market. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a cautious and strategic approach, focusing on long-term growth opportunities and effective risk management.

Taking into consideration the mixed signals in the ETH market and the positive outlook for Solana, it is important to adopt a slightly conservative trading approach with a focus on long-term strategies. While short-term gains may be tempting, managing risks effectively and capitalizing on growth opportunities in the long run is crucial.

Therefore, I would recommend a trading action of 0.5, reflecting moderate confidence in the potential bullish trend for Solana and the importance of long-term strategies in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. This decision allows for some flexibility while also prioritizing risk management and capitalizing on growth opportunities in the market.

He went on to criticize Solana’s ties to FTX, Jump Trading, and Multicoin Capital, suggesting their plan to “watch your transactions and systematically frontrun them” is a major red flag.\n\nFurther, Jonah argued decentralization is critical in crypto and centralized entities like FTX cannot be trusted, especially after recent events.

For a long time, Ethereum (ETH) has held a revered position, initially beginning as a nonconsensus asset back in 2018 and 2019. Fast forward to today, and Ethereum has garnered consensus, solidifying its position as a leading player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, the tides of the crypto world are ever-changing, and a new contender is making waves — Solana (SOL). Prominent crypto analysts now claim that Solana is the "strongest non-consensus asset" of the current bear market. Such bold claims are not made lightly, and the recent performance of Solana provides substantial backing to these assertions.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nExamining the daily chart of Solana reveals an explosive trajectory. After a series of oscillations, SOL has demonstrated a robust upward trend, capturing the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike. Peaks and troughs aside, the general momentum of Solana portrays bullish sentiment.\n\nBut what sets Solana apart in the crowded crypto domain? One key event solidifying its credibility was its resilience during the FTX crash. FTX, a prominent crypto exchange, was one of the major holders of Solana. Despite potential concerns of market manipulation or undue influence, Solana showcased stability and growth even after the FTX crash. This event not only fortified investor confidence but also indicated Solana\'s intrinsic value and potential for longevity in the crypto arena.\n\nNow, Solana stands in an advantageous position. The so-called shackles of major centralized holders are behind, and the ecosystem of Solana is burgeoning.

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
The news articles present a mixed outlook on Solana (SOL) in the cryptocurrency market. While some analysts believe SOL is experiencing a remarkable comeback and could lead to a "crypto summer" in 2024, others express concerns about structural challenges and potential risks associated with its ties to FTX and other entities. Despite the differing opinions, SOL has shown significant gains, with a 25% increase in a week and a 170% year-to-date rise. This volatility and conflicting perspectives suggest that the market trend for SOL may continue to be unpredictable in the short term, with potential for both further gains and corrections as investors assess the risks and opportunities associated with the cryptocurrency.

"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that ETH has been experiencing a bullish trend with active trading activity and strong demand. However, the recent switch in MACD signal to a sell may indicate a potential short-term correction or consolidation in the market. 

The news analyst report highlights challenges faced by Solana, which could impact the overall cryptocurrency market sentiment. Despite this, there are positive developments that could contribute to Solana's long-term growth. It is crucial to monitor how Solana addresses these challenges to determine potential trading opportunities.

The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a cautious and strategic approach, focusing on long-term growth opportunities and effective risk management. It suggests prioritizing long-term strategies over short-term gains and closely monitoring key indicators to capitalize on growth opportunities while minimizing losses.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is advisable to adopt a slightly conservative trading approach and prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains. The potential short-term correction or consolidation in the ETH market, along with the challenges faced by Solana, may introduce volatility and risks. Therefore, managing risks effectively and focusing on long-term growth opportunities is key.

The news analyst report highlights the advancements in the Solana ecosystem, indicating growing interest and investment in Solana. This could potentially lead to increased adoption and value appreciation of SOL. Traders should keep a close eye on Solana's performance as these developments could positively impact its market trend.

In reflecting on past trading performance, a cautious and strategic approach focusing on long-term growth opportunities and effective risk management has been successful. It is important to monitor key indicators such as MACD signals, total transactions, and market sentiment towards specific cryptocurrencies like Solana.

After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing uncertainty and potential volatility. The fluctuating open prices, inconsistent successful transactions, and the switching MACD signal all point towards a market that lacks a clear direction.

The news analyst report on Solana (SOL) further adds to the overall uncertainty in the cryptocurrency market. While SOL has shown significant gains, the conflicting perspectives and mixed outlook suggest that short-term trends for SOL may continue to be unpredictable.

In light of the reflection analyst report, which emphasizes a slightly conservative approach focusing on long-term growth opportunities and effective risk management, it is prudent to adopt a similar strategy in the current market environment.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, we see that ETH has been on a bullish trend with increasing open prices and active trading activity. However, the recent change in macd_signal from buy to sell at an open price of 23.96 may indicate a potential reversal in the market trend. This suggests a need for caution and close monitoring of price movements and market indicators.

The news analyst report highlights the advancements in the Solana ecosystem, indicating growing interest and investment in Solana. This could potentially lead to increased adoption and value appreciation of SOL. Traders should keep a close eye on Solana's performance as these developments could positively impact its market trend.

In reflecting on past trading performance, a cautious and strategic approach focusing on long-term growth opportunities and effective risk management has been successful. It is important to monitor key indicators such as MACD signals, total transactions, and market sentiment towards specific cryptocurrencies like Solana. A slightly conservative trading approach with a focus on long-term strategies is recommended to manage risks effectively and capitalize on growth opportunities.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is advisable to adopt a long-term strategy over short-term gains. Therefore, I would take a slightly conservative approach and assign a trading action of 0.3, reflecting moderate confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.
ACTION:
0.3
DAILY RETURN:
0.06328905433442822
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing fluctuations with mixed signals from the MACD indicator, suggesting a lack of clear direction. The news analyst report, on the other hand, highlights a positive outlook for Solana (SOL) with indicators pointing towards a potential bullish breakout and continued growth in the market. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a cautious and strategic approach, focusing on long-term growth opportunities and effective risk management.

Taking into consideration the mixed signals in the ETH market and the positive outlook for Solana, it is important to adopt a slightly conservative trading approach with a focus on long-term strategies. While short-term gains may be tempting, managing risks effectively and capitalizing on growth opportunities in the long run is crucial.

Therefore, I would recommend a trading action of 0.5, reflecting moderate confidence in the potential bullish trend for Solana and the importance of long-term strategies in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. This decision allows for some flexibility while also prioritizing risk management and capitalizing on growth opportunities in the market.
ACTION:
0.5
DAILY RETURN:
0.08352565820268221
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing uncertainty and potential volatility. The fluctuating open prices, inconsistent successful transactions, and the switching MACD signal all point towards a market that lacks a clear direction.

The news analyst report on Solana (SOL) further adds to the overall uncertainty in the cryptocurrency market. While SOL has shown significant gains, the conflicting perspectives and mixed outlook suggest that short-term trends for SOL may continue to be unpredictable.

In light of the reflection analyst report, which emphasizes a slightly conservative approach focusing on long-term growth opportunities and effective risk management, it is prudent to adopt a similar strategy in the current market environment. By closely monitoring key indicators and staying updated on market trends, a long-term strategy can help navigate the volatility and uncertainty in the market.

Therefore, considering the mixed signals in the ETH market and the positive outlook for Solana, I would recommend a slightly conservative trading approach with a focus on long-term strategies to manage risks effectively and capitalize on growth opportunities.

After reviewing the reports from the on-chain analyst, news analyst, and reflection analyst, it is clear that the market sentiment for ETH is uncertain and bearish due to fluctuating open prices, total transactions, and the switching MACD signal.

He delivers high-quality engaging articles to Coinpedia through his in-depth research and analysis.\n\nThis week brought a positive trend in the crypto market, with Bitcoin knocking the $30K threshold. This development has sparked buyer interest in several altcoins, potentially signaling a recovery in the ‘Uptober’ movement. With the closing of October on the edge, historical patterns suggest a solid bullish week, possibly triggering a fresh round of purchases. Consequently, several altcoins, such as Ripple’s XRP, Solana, and Chainlink, are poised for further gains.\n\nBitcoin Attracts Altcoin Investors\n\nWith Bitcoin price witnessing massive volatility and upswings around the psychological level of $30K, altcoins are now struggling to witness an influx of new capital. As a result, investors show less interest in altcoins.\n\nAccording to Blockchain Center, the altcoin season index is now far away from 75 as it hovers around 20. It suggests that the current sentiment is favoring Bitcoin season, with BTC prices meeting buyers’ expectations. However, an aggressive purchase of altcoins next week might push the metric toward the North.\n\nXRP Price Analysis\n\nXRP price witnessed a massive upswing following Ripple’s victory against the SEC. As a result, the altcoin surged above EMA lines and is now holding above EMA20. However, bears a preventing further surge as the price faces selling pressure at $0.53.\n\nCurrently, the moving averages are leveling, and the RSI hovers just above the midline, signaling buyers’ comeback for the XRP within the $0.5 to $0.558 range. Should the price maintain above the moving averages, there’s a chance for the price to ascend to the next resistance level at $0.558 and then to $0.668.\n\nAlternatively, a decline below the moving averages could enhance the chances of a decline to EMA200. A significant trend shift is anticipated if the price declines below $0.44.\n\nSolana (SOL) Price Analysis\n\nSOL price experienced a significant surge, surging above the crucial neckline of the inverse head-and-shoulders (H&S) formation, validating a positive trend.\n\nThe upward momentum continues as buyers dominate with long positions, with investors aiming to send the value past a critical hurdle at $30. Achieving this could pave the way for the SOL price to surge toward the anticipated target of $33.\n\nTypically, following a breakout beyond significant resistance, there’s a tendency for the price to retract and revisit the former breakout point. Here, the price might draw back to test the neckline.\n\nShould the price rebound from $24.5, it could signal the commencement of another bullish phase. Conversely, a downturn from $24 will result in the upper hand back to the bears, potentially dampening the market sentiment.\n\nChainlink (LINK) Price Analysis\n\nThe extended wick on Chainlink’s candlestick highlights strong purchasing activity by the bulls within the $7.6 to $8.7 range.\n\nFor a bullish trend continuation, buyers need to hold the momentum above the current level and send the price above $9.7. Successfully doing so could pave the way for a surge toward the next barrier at $12.2.\n\nThis point is likely to see a robust battle between the bulls and the bears. However, a decline below EMA50 will plunge the altcoin toward $5.7.'}, {'id': 4, 'time': 'Sun, 22 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Solana has a good chance of being 2024’s best performer - FXStreet', 'content': 'Solana price performance since the start of 2023 is 195%, beating Bitcoin’s 82% and Chainlink’s 70.52%.\n\nThis performance could carry forward to the next year, keeping SOL relevant and rallying higher.\n\nTechnicals suggest SOL could more than double if a few conditions are met.\n\nSolana (SOL) price suffered a major setback after the FTX exchange filed for bankruptcy. But SOL’s comeback is nothing short of a miracle, considering its year-to-date returns of 195% overshadow that of Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAlthough the majority of crypto investors believe that Solana is a delicate asset due to the FTX proceedings, there are a few reasons which suggest otherwise.\n\nCrypto YTD Performance\n\nAlso read: Solana price turns bullish after confirming trend reversal, 20% gains incoming for SOL?\n\nSolana could outperform notable altcoins in 2024\n\nThe first reason why investors should keep an eye on Solana price is how the altcoin has outperformed major cryptos. SOL shot up from $9.97 to nearly $30 in the span of the last ten months. On October 21 alone, the Ethereum competitor yielded a 25% return, while investors were busy gawking at Chainlink’s 21% rally.\n\nSo, where is this momentum coming from?\n\nContrarian thinking: Many investors are staying away from Solana due to the drama surrounding FTX and the ongoing bankruptcy lawsuit. But when a major chunk of investors believe that, then the chances of an altcoin rallying would be high. This phenomenon is precisely why local tops are formed at peak hype or retail frenzy. It is also why cycle bottoms are produced during times when investors capitulate. So, with that in mind, Solana price will continue to rally until investors believe that SOL is a touch-y coin due to the FTX proceedings.\n\nMany investors are staying away from Solana due to the drama surrounding FTX and the ongoing bankruptcy lawsuit.

SOL to ETH Ratio: Despite Solana price being in a worse state than Ethereum after the FTX crash, the SOL to ETH ratio has risen to 0.06, a level last seen almost a year ago.

A bounce from this level is key to kickstarting a rally to $69.79.\n\nSOL/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if Solana price breaches the key low of $21.11, it would create a lower low and invalidate the bullish thesis.

"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing fluctuations with mixed signals from the MACD indicator, suggesting a lack of clear direction. The news analyst report, on the other hand, highlights a positive outlook for Solana (SOL) with indicators pointing towards a potential bullish breakout and continued growth in the market. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a cautious and strategic approach, focusing on long-term growth opportunities and effective risk management.

Taking into consideration the mixed signals in the ETH market and the positive outlook for Solana, it is important to adopt a slightly conservative trading approach with a focus on long-term strategies. While short-term gains may be tempting, managing risks effectively and capitalizing on growth opportunities in the long run is crucial.

Therefore, I would recommend a trading action of 0.5, reflecting moderate confidence in the potential bullish trend for Solana and the importance of long-term strategies in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. This decision allows for some flexibility while also prioritizing risk management and capitalizing on growth opportunities in the market.
ACTION:
0.5
DAILY RETURN:

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing uncertainty and potential volatility. The fluctuating open prices, inconsistent successful transactions, and the switching MACD signal all point towards a market that lacks a clear direction.

The news analyst report on Solana (SOL) further adds to the overall uncertainty in the cryptocurrency market. While SOL has shown significant gains, the conflicting perspectives and mixed outlook suggest that short-term trends for SOL may continue to be unpredictable.

In light of the reflection analyst report, which emphasizes a slightly conservative approach focusing on long-term growth opportunities and effective risk management, it is prudent to adopt a similar strategy in the current market environment. By closely monitoring key indicators and staying updated on market trends, a long-term strategy can help navigate the volatility and uncertainty in the market.

Therefore, considering the mixed signals in the ETH market and the positive outlook for Solana, I would recommend a slightly conservative trading approach with a focus on long-term strategies to manage risks effectively and capitalize on growth opportunities.

REASONING:
After reviewing the reports from the on-chain analyst, news analyst, and reflection analyst, it is clear that the market sentiment for ETH is uncertain and bearish due to fluctuating open prices, total transactions, and the switching MACD signal. On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights a bullish trend for Solana (SOL) with positive outlooks and growth potential in the DeFi and NFT markets.

Considering the current market conditions and the potential growth opportunities in Solana, it is advisable to take a slightly conservative approach and focus on long-term strategies rather than short-term gains. By closely monitoring market trends and indicators, traders can capitalize on growth opportunities while effectively managing risks in the volatile cryptocurrency market.

Therefore, my trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.7. This decision reflects a cautious approach towards the uncertain market trend for ETH and the potential growth opportunities presented by Solana. By strategically managing risk and focusing on long-term growth prospects, traders can navigate the market fluctuations and position themselves for success in the cryptocurrency market.

While Ethereum grappled with security apprehensions, Solana’s extraordinary performance lured a surge of investments, emphasizing the shifting dynamics within the crypto market.\n\nClaim up to $30,030 in Bonus 100x Leverage Start Trading\n\nBroader Crypto Investment Landscape\n\nThe crypto investment landscape is witnessing a positive trend, especially in digital asset investment products. These products have enjoyed a streak of four consecutive weeks with inflows, accumulating a substantial total of $66 million. When you combine these four weeks, the sum reaches an impressive $179 million in inflows.\n\nHowever, it’s worth noting that this recent inflow, while promising, is viewed in the context of cautious investor sentiment. CoinShares analyst James Butterfill points out that despite these positive developments, it’s essential to recognize that the recent inflows are not quite at the level of the initial frenzy that followed BlackRock’s announcement back in June. This suggests that investors, though optimistic, are approaching the crypto market with a degree of caution, perhaps learning from past market volatility and uncertainty.\n\nClaim up to $30,030 in Bonus 100x Leverage Start Trading\n\nSolana’s Role in the Crypto Landscape\n\nSolana’s recent performance underscores the burgeoning interest in innovative blockchain technologies, with Solana shining at the forefront of this movement. Its surge and the influx of investments into Solana-related products are indicative of a growing appetite for alternative blockchain platforms beyond the established giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAs Solana continues to capture attention and investments, there’s speculation about its ability to sustain its current momentum and go head-to-head with the well-entrenched players in the crypto realm. Can Solana emerge as a formidable competitor, challenging the dominance of Bitcoin and Ethereum? The answer to this question will be closely watched in the coming months.\n\nEnhance Your Crypto Trading Skills With Our Legends’ Trading Masterclass\n\nEmpower your crypto trading skills with our Legends Masterclass.

It seems the market overcorrected, and now SOL is bouncing back to make up for lost ground.\n\nSolana's been scoring some big partnerships recently – case in point, they hooked up with Shopify so merchants can accept crypto payments quickly and cheaply using SOL.\n\nSolana's decentralized finance apps, or DeFi for short, have tripled users in just a few months.\n\nSolana (SOL) has been on an impressive run over the past few weeks. The price of the SOL token has surged over 38% in the last 7 days alone. This has led many in the crypto community to wonder – what's causing this pump?\n\nIn this article, we'll explore 3 key reasons why Solana is seeing such strong price action right now.\n\nReason 1: Solana was oversold during the FTX crash\n\nThe first reason SOL is pumping right now is because it was heavily oversold during the FTX implosion. When FTX went bankrupt, the price of SOL crashed a whopping 79% in a matter of weeks. After the decline in the FTX crash, all investors had only one question in mind: Will Solana Recover?\n\nThis brutal sell-off was driven by forced liquidations of FTX/Alameda's SOL holdings. But here's the thing – Solana didn't have any direct involvement in FTX's shady dealings, at least as far as what’s publicly known. It could be argued that the sell-off was irrational and pushed SOL price far below its true value.\n\nNow that the crypto market sentiment is improving, SOL is bouncing back more aggressively than other top cryptos. It's making up for lost ground and correcting the oversold conditions.\n\nReason 2: A wave of positive developments in the SOL ecosystem\n\nThere have also been some legitimately positive developments for Solana in recent weeks that are fueling the rally.\n\nIn late August, Solana launched an integration with Shopify that allows merchants to accept crypto payments settled in USDC on the Solana blockchain. Over 1 million Shopify stores now have access to fast, low-cost Solana payments.\n\n1/ ?️Shopify ?Solana Pay\n\n\n\nToday, Solana Pay integrates with @Shopify, empowering the millions of entrepreneurs and merchants on Shopify to accept fast, web3 native payments with no transaction fees through the end of 2023. https://t.co/q63KeBllXB\n\n\n\nLearn more ? pic.twitter.com/QEb1LzqS51 — Solana (@solana) August 23, 2023\n\nShortly after, Visa announced it was using USDC on Solana for its new cross-border settlement network. This could dramatically improve the efficiency of Visa's global payment operations.\n\nThese are just two examples of real-world Solana adoption happening right now. The more its blockchain technology is utilized, the higher demand grows for the SOL token.\n\nReason 3: Surging DeFi activity\n\nBeyond price and partnership news, we're also seeing a surge in decentralized finance (DeFi) activity on Solana that is boosting confidence in the ecosystem.\n\nAccording to DefiLlama, the total value locked in Solana DeFi has tripled since the start of 2023, surging from $214 million to over $654 million currently.\n\nSolana TVL. Image source: DeFiLlama\n\nAs Ethereum gas fees remain high, developers are turning to SOL's high-speed, low-cost blockchain for their DeFi applications. This increase in platform usage increases the utility and value of the SOL token.\n\nThe growth of Solana's DeFi ecosystem shows that developers still see a bright future despite the FTX fiasco.\n\nSOL still has room to run\n\nGiven these developments, analysts generally agree that Solana still has room to run. The CoinCodex algorithm predicts SOL will rise another 65% by year's end to hit $47.\n\nOf course, a broader crypto rally would provide a significant tailwind. But even in neutral markets, Solana appears poised to continue outperforming. Its blockchain activity is expanding and the price has corrected from irrational lows.\n\nMany investors state that they invest in Solana for the long term because they trust its technology and team.

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing uncertainty and potential volatility. The fluctuating open prices, inconsistent successful transactions, and the switching MACD signal all point towards a market that lacks a clear direction.

The news analyst report on Solana (SOL) further adds to the overall uncertainty in the cryptocurrency market. While SOL has shown significant gains, the conflicting perspectives and mixed outlook suggest that short-term trends for SOL may continue to be unpredictable.

In light of the reflection analyst report, which emphasizes a slightly conservative approach focusing on long-term growth opportunities and effective risk management, it is prudent to adopt a similar strategy in the current market environment. By closely monitoring key indicators and staying updated on market trends, a long-term strategy can help navigate the volatility and uncertainty in the market.

Therefore, considering the mixed signals in the ETH market and the positive outlook for Solana, I would recommend a slightly conservative trading approach with a focus on long-term strategies to manage risks effectively and capitalize on growth opportunities.

This indicates a lack of investor confidence and a downward trajectory for ETH in the near future.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights the bullish trend for Solana (SOL), with strong market performance, Asian investor interest, and positive momentum driving its price up. The technical indicators also suggest a potential doubling in price for Solana if certain conditions are met.

In reflection of the recent trading performance and the reports provided, it is evident that a slightly conservative approach focusing on long-term growth opportunities and effective risk management is more successful in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. Given the uncertain market sentiment for ETH and the positive outlook for Solana, it is essential to maintain a cautious approach and focus on long-term growth prospects.

Considering the synthesized reports and the emphasis on long-term strategies, I would take a slightly conservative approach and assign a trading action of 0.3, reflecting moderate confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.

Its ambitious aim was to address the long-standing scalability issues that had hindered many other blockchain networks. The launch of Solana's Mainnet Beta in March 2020 marked the beginning of its journey as an operational blockchain network. Let's delve into the fundamental features that set Solana apart in the world of blockchain.\n\n1. High Throughput: Solana's exceptional throughput, attributed to its innovative consensus mechanism and Proof of Stake (PoS) system, positions it to manage a staggering number of transactions. This feature makes Solana well-suited for applications ranging from high-frequency trading to decentralized gaming.\n\n2. Low Fees: Unlike many blockchain networks plagued by unpredictable and soaring transaction fees during periods of congestion, Solana offers consistently low fees.\n\n3. Scalability: From its foundational design, Solana emphasizes scalability. It employs unique approaches such as sharding, which divides the network into smaller subnets that process transactions in parallel. This design ensures that block propagation and confirmation times remain steady as the network expands, accommodating a growing user base without compromising performance.\n\n4. Smart Contracts: Solana empowers developers to create decentralized applications (dApps) through smart contracts, opening the door to a wide array of possibilities. These self-executing contracts drive innovation in areas like decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces.\n\nWhile Solana enjoyed rapid growth and success, it encountered a series of challenges starting with the Luna market incident, which sent shockwaves throughout the crypto market.

The exchange's mismanagement and subsequent bankruptcy filing not only stirred panic among investors but also raised concerns about the fate of Solana's assets held within the troubled platform.\n\nSolana's Vulnerability Exposed\n\nWith FTX's mounting financial woes, Solana's reputation was pulled into the chaos. Sam Bankman-Fried's vocal advocacy of Solana now seemed to work against the blockchain, as the bankrupt FTX held a significant amount of SOL, creating uncertainty leading to a sell-off.\n\nWhile the Solana Foundation confirmed relatively minimal exposure to FTX's crisis, a report hinted at Alameda Research's considerable holdings of SOL tokens, causing concerns about potential liquidations and their impact on Solana's already turbulent market value.\n\nSolana's Price Plunge Amidst Macroeconomic Headwinds\n\nThe broader macroeconomic conditions took a toll on the entire cryptocurrency space, and Solana was no exception. Escalating inflation and an impending rate hike by the Federal Reserve shattered the notion that cryptocurrencies would act as a reliable hedge against economic volatility.\n\nOther factors adding to the pain of Solana\n\nPerennial Network Outages and Performance Issues\n\nSolana's persistent struggle with network outages and performance glitches has significantly impacted user confidence.

This indicates a lack of investor confidence and a downward trajectory for ETH in the near future.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights the bullish trend for Solana (SOL), with strong market performance, Asian investor interest, and positive momentum driving its price up. The technical indicators also suggest a potential doubling in price for Solana if certain conditions are met.

In reflection of the recent trading performance and the reports provided, it is evident that a slightly conservative approach focusing on long-term growth opportunities and effective risk management is more successful in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. Given the uncertain market sentiment for ETH and the positive outlook for Solana, it is essential to maintain a cautious approach and focus on long-term growth prospects.

Considering the synthesized reports and the emphasis on long-term strategies, I would take a slightly conservative approach and assign a trading action of 0.3, reflecting moderate confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately. This approach allows for potential growth opportunities while mitigating risks associated with the current bearish trend in ETH.
ACTION:
0.3
DAILY RETURN:
0.04418170677433908
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that ETH has been on a downward trend with decreasing open prices and successful transactions, along with a consistent sell indication from the MACD signal. This indicates a bearish trend for ETH in the near future. 

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights the bullish trend for Solana (SOL) due to significant institutional investment inflows, positive developments, and growing confidence in the ecosystem. This suggests a potential for further price appreciation and increased adoption for SOL.

Reflecting on the recent trading performance and considering the uncertain market sentiment for ETH, it is advisable to adopt a slightly conservative approach with a focus on long-term growth opportunities and effective risk management. This aligns with the positive outlook for SOL and the need to capitalize on growth opportunities while managing risks effectively.

Therefore, the clear market trend indicates a bearish outlook for ETH in the short term, while SOL presents a bullish trend with potential for long-term growth. In line with this analysis, I would take a slightly conservative approach and focus on long-term strategies by selling ETH and buying SOL, with a trading action confidence level of 0.7.

This integration marks a significant shift in the crypto landscape by bridging the gap between Solana and Ethereum, reducing the barriers of entry to the Solana ecosystem, and offering a more convenient experience for users.\n\nBreaking Down the Barrier\n\nFor years, Solana and MetaMask had been incompatible, necessitating the use of separate wallets for managing SOL and NFTs on Solana’s network. This division has always posed a hurdle for those interested in exploring both ecosystems. However, according to a Monday announcement, with this new feature, Solflare seeks to break down these barriers and foster cross-chain engagement.\n\nadvertisement\n\nLast month, Filip Dragoslavic, co-founder of Solflare stressed that this integration has the potential to be a game-changer, as it opens the door for MetaMask’s substantial user base to explore and engage with Solana’s dynamic array of applications.\n\nA Seamless User Experience\n\nNotably, the core of this integration lied in “Solana Snaps,” a tool that establishes a connection between Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains. This connection allows users to manage all their assets in one unified platform. Essentially, this integration will allow users to store tokens and collect NFTs on Solana, connect to Solana apps and bridge assets seamlessly to Solana.\n\nThe technology operates with the assistance of a bridge powered by DLN, a product from deBridge. This bridge enables the smooth transfer of EVM assets to Solana. The installation process is described as straightforward, with the migration of EVM assets to Solana taking less than a minute.\n\nThis development is crucial in unifying two networks that have historically operated on different infrastructures, addressing the fragmentation that has posed challenges in the blockchain sector.\n\nEnhancing Security and User Experience\n\nWhile bridges have faced security concerns in the past, the project underpinning this integration, deBridge, takes a proactive approach to security. It is worth noting that deBridge previously thwarted an attempted cyberattack by North Korea’s Lazarus Group. Unlike conventional cross-chain bridges, deBridge’s infrastructure is designed to mitigate vulnerabilities, providing added security to users.\n\nThat said, with the new integration users will now seamlessly explore the vibrant Solana ecosystem while utilizing their MetaMask wallets.'}, {'id': 6, 'time': 'Wed, 25 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'SocialFi: Web3 Social Media Platform DSCVR Launches on Solana - Blockonomi', 'content': 'The decentralized social media platform DSCVR announced today its expansion into the Solana ecosystem.

The total transactions have been relatively high, ranging from 29134765 to 36271205, with successful transactions varying between 16755771 and 19966191. Despite the high transaction volumes, the successful transactions have been decreasing, which may indicate a lack of bullish momentum in the market. Therefore, it is likely that the ETH price will continue to decline in the near future.

VanEck’s analysis suggests that this sector, particularly SCPs, is poised for significant adoption in the future, positioning Solana as a prominent player in the blockchain industry.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nBitcoin Braces For $50 Billion Influx Following ETF Launch, Bitwise CEO Says 6 months ago\n\nSolana’s Dominance In Smart Contract Platforms\n\nSolana’s emergence as a dominant force in the SCP realm is reinforced by its high throughput and scalability, surpassing many existing blockchain networks. Its ability to process a high volume of transactions quickly and at a lower cost compared to some competitors has been a pivotal factor driving its influence and potential for widespread adoption.\n\nTotal crypto market cap currently at $1.24 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com\n\nAdditionally, Solana’s ecosystem has seen a surge in decentralized applications (dApps) and projects leveraging its infrastructure, further solidifying its position as an attractive and viable platform for developers and users alike. This growing adoption and technical superiority hint at a promising trajectory for Solana, suggesting it may remain a key player in the expanding landscape of blockchain technology.\n\nThe VanEck report underscored the undeniable dominance of Solana in the SCP sector. But despite these existing alternatives, none have managed to rival Solana’s current supremacy within the field. VanEck further highlighted the sector’s imminent surge in adoption, foreseeing a promising growth trajectory by 2030.\n\nSource: VanEck\n\nHowever, the report also emphasized the necessity of a groundbreaking application for exponential expansion. According to VanEck, among the contenders, Solana stands as the most fitting platform with the potential to fill this pivotal role, positioning itself as the likely candidate to lead the sector’s transformative growth.\n\nVanEck observed that the blockchain hosting the groundbreaking application could experience substantial benefits from the app’s generated activity. The analysis presents a scenario where Solana becomes the pioneering blockchain to support a single application that brings on board over 100 million users.\n\nOver the past week L1s have started to see a shift in sentiment.$SOL activity for the month has translated to sharp increased in DEX volume activity as TVL and users have seen an uptick.

Solana crossed the $100 mark after almost 20 months since April 2022.\n\nLet us discuss the market performance and price history of Solana along with the reasons behind Solana’s ongoing price surge.\n\nadvertisement\n\nFactors Propelling Solana’s Rise\n\nSolana price is up as a result of the rising SPL token airdrops and listing on exchanges, increased DeFi and NFT activity on the Solana network, and increasing trading volume.\n\nSPL Token Airdrops\n\nSolana has always been a viable blockchain network with high transaction processing for DeFi development. Jito is one of the DeFi projects on Solana that launched its highly anticipated JTO token airdrop. Adding to that, Coinbase announced the listing of JTO tokens on December 6, 2023.\n\nSolana price increased by 15% and was trading over $72 on December 8, 2023 as a result of the Jito DeFi project airdrop and listing on crypto exchange platforms. The JTO token was launched at a starting price of $6.01 and distributed around $225 million worth of JTO tokens in its recent airdrop. Even though the JTO price is currently trading at $2.82, it brought a huge attention to the Solana and led to its price surge.\n\nPotential Solana ecosystem airdrops that you can still qualify for: MarginFi – Borrowing/lending (active points system)\n\nTensor – NFT exchange (active points system)\n\nDrift – perp dex\n\nKamino – Borrowing/lending (upcoming points system)\n\nParcl – Real estate speculation (upcoming… — Patrick Scott | Dynamo DeFi (@Dynamo_Patrick) December 8, 2023\n\nSolana proponents are expecting a few more airdrops of the SPL tokens airdrops of Solana DeFi projects, following the success of JTO airdrop. Analyst Patrick Scott posted on X, listing the upcoming Solana token airdrops for those who missed the JTO airdrop. The anticipation of these upcoming airdrops is a primary reason behind Solana’s price rise.\n\nRising NFT Sales Volume\n\nSolana’s 24-hour NFT sales volume has surpassed the NFT sales volume of Ethereum on June 30, 2023. According to CryptoSlam, Solana is currently at the third position in terms of 30-day NFT sales volume after the two top blockchains, Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nNFT sales worth $162 million took place on the Solana Network, which is up by 350% in the last 30 days. Coming to the number of NFT transactions, Solana ranks above Bitcoin and Ethereum with more than 2 million transactions. This incredible rise in NFT trading activity adds to the ongoing price rally of Solana.\n\nTech Upgrades\n\nAfter facing network outages several times previously, Solana’s reputation of being the fastest blockchain crumbled. However, the technical upgrades of the network are strengthening the blockchain. The Solana network performance improved significantly in H1, 2023 with 100% uptime.\n\nSolana’s developers keep bringing tech upgrades to make the coin even more perfect for several use cases. It has added optional zero-knowledge-compatible encryption that will make the transactions even more secure. Furthermore, Solana will help extend Render Network into new applications, such as machine learning and inference training.\n\nSolana supports several innovative blockchain applications including NFTs, Web3 gaming, DeFi projects, and other decentralized applications. The fundamental technical strength of Solana is an add on feature to its ultra-speed transaction processing at low fees. In addition, Solana is one of the first blockchain to launch a Web3 smartphone in April 2023.\n\nSolana price surged by 5% on December 6, 2023 when its founder Anatoly Yakovenko talked about the upcoming launch of new Web3 smartphone models with more applications.\n\nSol Prediction : What’s Next For Solana Price?\n\nConsidering the recent price breakout of Solana, popular crypto analysts like Ali Martinez estimated a continuous price rise in the upcoming weeks. Ali posted on X stating that the price breakout above $68 can propel Solana’s price to $90. However, if the price drops below the $60 support, it could fall back to $47.\n\nOn another note, global investment manager VanEck estimated over 10,000% Solana price rally by 2030. The Solana price is already on the uptrend as the year comes to end, showing the possibility of VanEck’s estimation!'}]

REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that ETH has been on a downward trend with decreasing open prices and successful transactions, along with a consistent sell indication from the MACD signal. This indicates a bearish trend for ETH in the near future. 

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights the bullish trend for Solana (SOL) due to significant institutional investment inflows, positive developments, and growing confidence in the ecosystem. This suggests a potential for further price appreciation and increased adoption for SOL.

Reflecting on the recent trading performance and considering the uncertain market sentiment for ETH, it is advisable to adopt a slightly conservative approach with a focus on long-term growth opportunities and effective risk management. This aligns with the positive outlook for SOL and the need to capitalize on growth opportunities while managing risks effectively.

Therefore, the clear market trend indicates a bearish outlook for ETH in the short term, while SOL presents a bullish trend with potential for long-term growth.

This robust ascent, mirrored by a notable increase in trading volume, underscores growing investor interest.\n\nMoreover, the convergence of moving averages and the recent bullish crossover suggests a positive trend. This can be considered a sign of potential further upside for Solana, echoing the sentiment of the latter part of 2021.

You have an impulse. Then you have a bunch of sideways and now you have a second one. I like this chart. If I had to buy an altcoin, still, even at this point, it would be Solana and it would be LINK.”\n\nNext up, the trader says Bitcoin could mirror a price pattern in 2018 and soar to a range high of $60,000.\n\n“Target-wise, if we break this level [at $35,028] I just think $60,000 is next. I think if you come and reclaim range, it’s moon time. If you compare it to 2018, we had a consolidation. We had a breakdown. This was a little bit longer of a breakdown, but same, and then people were trying to short the retest and that very much didn’t go to plan.

As a result, a novel and engaging ecosystem is being fostered for creators of varying sizes and expertise, including CryptoSlate Alpha.\n\nMika Honkasalo, Access Protocol founder, emphasizes the company’s mission, stating,\n\n“We’re in the early stages of building a monetization ecosystem for creators of all shapes and sizes. We are set to build products and tools creators are used to in web2, super-powered only by what can be built on Web3 rails.”\n\nThis expansion comes following Access Protocol’s day-one listing of an SPL Token on Coinbase on Feb. 15. Since its launch, Access Protocol has accrued over 220,000 unique subscribers across its content offerings. Notably, existing publications and service providers such as CoinGecko, The Block, CryptoSlate, DeSpread (South Korea), and Crypto-Times (Japan) are leveraging Access for web3 monetization.\n\nIn addition to its fundraising success, Access Labs has also unveiled a beta of its independent publishing platform, Access Scribe. This platform offers a robust alternative to Substack or Mirror and has built-in web3 monetization capabilities.\n\nPlatforms such as Taiwan-based media outlet WuBlockchain and South Korean research and consulting firm DeSpread have been among the first to utilize this innovative resource.\n\nFrom a broader perspective, Andreas Nicolos, Access Labs Head of Ecosystem Growth, contends that non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are the next focus area for their product suite. He states,\n\n“Barriers to entry into Web3 are too high for traditional media firms. We’ve seen incumbent media companies allocate massive amounts of resources to web3 strategies that lack depth and business continuity. The industry needs a no code, one-stop shop platform where any creator can grow and develop a foundation of user relationships on chain.”\n\nUnderlining the significance of this development for the broader Web3 space, DV Ventures, the venture arm of Chicago-based DV Trading, emphasized its excitement to further its involvement in Web3, stating,\n\n“New monetization models are fundamental to the promise of the crypto industry, and Access stands to emerge at the forefront in the digital content space.”\n\nThe fundraising achievement and subsequent developments signal Access Labs’ commitment to fostering an innovative ecosystem for creators. As the crypto industry continues to evolve, Access Labs’ advancements could serve as a catalyst for unprecedented growth within the web3 content and digital content spaces.\n\nDisclaimer: CryptoSlate, a media partner of Access Protocol, received a grant.\n\nDisclosure: Sora Ventures is an investor in CryptoSlate.\n\nMentioned in this article'}, {'id': 3, 'time': 'Fri, 27 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'USC fall transfer students fulfill dream of becoming Trojan - University of Southern California', 'content': 'Solana Marquez, one of 1,335 newly enrolled transfer students who began classes at USC this fall, says she feels deeply happy and proud to finally be a Trojan.\n\n“USC had been my dream,” the junior from the USC Viterbi School of Engineering said. “When I was unable to attend coming out of high school, it was really hard.”\n\nAs a Latina, Marquez is also part of the 27% of new transfer students who are from ethnic groups that have been historically underrepresented in American higher education: 17% Latino, 7% Black, and 6% who identify with two or more ethnic groups, some of which are underrepresented. In addition, Native American and Native Hawaiian students make up 0.3% of the transfers.\n\nBased on national data from the federal government, USC leads all private research universities when it comes to enrolling transfer students.\n\nUSC’s Office of Admission reports that the transfer class comes from approximately 300 different colleges and universities, with 52% transferring from a community college in California and 8% coming from schools within the Los Angeles Community College District.\n\n“Even though we are a private institution, we are working for the public good and taking care of students in our own backyard,” USC Dean of Admission Timothy Brunold said. “We are continuing to prioritize transfer students and they have long been important to USC.”\n\nSanta Monica College sent the largest number of new students (107) to USC, followed by Pasadena City College (67), Glendale Community College (43), El Camino College (34) and Los Angeles Pierce College (27).\n\n“We are continuing to prioritize transfer students and they have long been important to USC.” — Timothy Brunold, USC dean of admission\n\nMeanwhile, 13% of new transfer students came from a University of California or California State University school, with most students coming from the University of California, Santa Barbara; the University of California, Irvine; and the University of California, Riverside.\n\n“Each year, we have enrollment goals to meet, and we always hold room for transfer students, which is a little different than at some colleges,” Brunold said. “We are proactive, and transfers are a permanent part of our enrollment mix.”\n\nThe road to USC for transfer students\n\nMarquez applied to USC while in high school, dreaming of attending her father’s alma mater. But she also applied to the University of San Francisco just in case — and was accepted to both schools. In a difficult decision based on finances, she agreed to go to school in San Francisco.\n\nAfter her freshman year, Marquez decided that she wanted her bachelor’s degree in computer science to be from USC and that she would take whatever steps necessary to make that happen. She moved back home and enrolled at Rio Hondo College in Whittier. She took the classes she needed, earned a merit-based scholarship and was able to move into Troy Hall and begin her junior year at USC this fall.\n\n“I’m so glad I’m here,” she said. “They have a great computer science program, and it has the collaborative environment I was looking for.”\n\nIn addition to her classwork, Marquez has been attending career fairs and Trojan Talks, both hosted by the Career Center. She has also found it invaluable to be paired with a mentor through the USC Viterbi Center for Engineering Diversity, which assists in the recruitment, retention, and graduation of people from minoritized backgrounds pursuing engineering degrees.\n\n“There are not a lot of women, especially Hispanic women, in my major, and I’m really proud that I have been able to get to this point,” she said, mentioning that USC has many resources for minorities in STEM that she’s been able to take advantage of.\n\n“A big goal of mine is to inspire others like me to be able to do what I’m doing here.”\n\nUSC transfer students: Being first-generation\n\nAntonio Espinoza-Espino, a sophomore in the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, transferred to USC after spending his freshman year at the College of the Sequoias in Visalia, Calif.

She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nDuring a recent criminal trial, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), the founder of FTX, disclosed that he had started purchasing Solana (SOL) tokens when they were priced at just 20 cents. He also revealed that the funds for this investment came from Alameda’s operating profits and loans from external sources. This revelation contrasted his previous statement, where he had offered to pay $3 per SOL token.\n\nA past Twitter post where SBF had proposed to pay $3 for each Solana token has now resurfaced, going viral across social media platforms. The crypto community quickly points out the aggressive nature of his attempt to acquire SOL tokens.\n\nThe “Sam Coin” and its Ties to Bankman-Fried\n\nSolana, sometimes referred to as a “Sam Coin” due to its strong ties with SBF, witnessed a rapid rise in popularity and value thanks to significant investments and promotions by him and his firms. However, the collapse of FTX in November raised questions about the sustainability of SOL’s price. The Solana ecosystem was significantly affected by the collapse of the exchange, with the blockchain community striving to overcome the impact ever since.\n\nAlso Read: Sam Bankman-Fried Breaks His Silence in a Tense Courtroom Drama: Here’s What Happened\n\nObjections from Federal Prosecutor and the Behavior of SBF\n\nDuring the trial, federal prosecutor Danielle Sassoon objected to Bankman-Fried’s evidence, an attempt by defense attorney Mark Cohen to show that SBF had exercised due diligence in transactions made while operating FTX and Alameda. Observers also noted the contrasting behavior of SBF during the trial. He appeared well-prepared and composed when answering questions from his defense attorneys but seemed nervous and stumbled when questioned by the prosecuting attorney from the Department of Justice regarding the alleged wire fraud.\n\nIn conclusion, Sam Bankman-Fried’s past investments and ties to Solana have been scrutinized during his recent criminal trial, revealing a complex web of transactions and relationships that have now come to the forefront.

The theory aims to predict price impulses based on crowd psychology, which tends to manifest in waves. Based on his chart, the analyst suggests that SOL is in the midst of a five-wave impulse to the upside that could top out near the $47 range before making its next move.\n\nWhen asked why he’s so zeroed in on Solana, Bluntz says he’s confident that SOL will outperform BTC and ETH in the near future.\n\nLooking at Bitcoin, the trader says that BTC’s price action strongly suggests that more upside action is imminent and that a dip to $32,000 is unlikely at this point.

The Solana ecosystem has roughly $378 million in total value locked as of press time.\n\nKiller app\n\nSolana’s approach to blockchain development centers on usability — a critical factor in determining the success of a blockchain in hosting the next “killer app.”\n\nWhile the user base of most blockchains remains relatively small compared to mainstream platforms like Facebook and PayPal, Solana aims to bridge this gap by offering a more efficient and user-friendly experience.\n\nTo achieve this, Solana has focused on enhancing its data throughput capacity, surpassing any other existing blockchain and promising even more significant improvements in the near future.\n\nThe report points out that Solana’s data throughput capabilities translate into quicker transaction processing, significantly outperforming Ethereum in terms of speed.\n\nWhile Ethereum’s transaction processing occurs at discrete intervals, Solana starts processing transactions instantly, resulting in turnaround times of approximately 2 seconds. This superior speed and efficiency are crucial for attracting users to the platform.\n\nThe report also draws a stark contrast between Solana’s philosophy and that of ETH.\n\nSolana, founded by Qualcomm engineers, emphasizes making blockspace inexpensive and user-friendly, with a vision of promoting abundant technological progress. Comparatively, ETH has shifted its focus from selling cheap blockspace daily to securing consumer-facing blockchains with expensive blockspace.\n\nChallenges\n\nWhile Solana’s approach has led to impressive technological advancements, it has not been without its challenges.\n\nThe report noted that while Solana generates revenue from transaction fees, it also incurs significant costs to secure its blockchain through SOL inflation payments to validators.\n\nIn the short term, Solana’s profitability may not be a concern, but ensuring organic SOL demand to cover security costs remains a long-term challenge.\n\nMoreover, Solana’s pricing model, which depends on resource pricing and congestion, could be problematic as more blockchains compete for specific use cases. The report suggests that if SOL prices weaken, Solana’s ability to sustain its current state might depend on the continuous influx of speculative capital.\n\nAdditionally, the report highlights Solana’s technical stability issues, citing unpredictable downtimes in the past due to the experimental nature of the system.\n\nWhile Solana has made improvements to mitigate these issues, its complex design and colossal data volumes make it difficult to predict and resolve future complications, potentially affecting its uptime and attractiveness to businesses.\n\nMentioned in this article'}, {'id': 11, 'time': 'Sat, 28 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Is It Too Late to Buy Solana?

While both projects share many similarities, there are still major differences between them. Understanding the key differences between SOL and ETH can help investors and traders make informed decisions to maximize their investments. But what factors should one take into consideration when doing a Solana vs Ethereum analysis? Here, we deep dive into the key aspects that differentiate SOL from ETH and vice versa.\n\nAbout Solana\n\nSolana, or SOL, was created by software developer Anatoly Yakovenko, who first proposed the project in 2017 and finally launched it in 2020. The coin takes inspiration from Etherum and was eventually created to improve upon Etherum. Many crypto enthusiasts and experts considered Solana a potential ‘Ethereum killer.’\n\nadvertisement\n\nSolana emerged as a new-generation crypto coin that addressed several shortcomings of popular tokens launched before it. The coin’s transactions are conducted on the Solana blockchain, which uses a proof-of-history consensus mechanism instead of a proof-of-work mechanism used by popular initial coins like Bitcoin.\n\nIn layman’s terms, the proof-of-work mechanism depends on miners to unearth the next block and is slow and has a high energy demand. In comparison, the proof-of-history consensus mechanism is fast and requires 99.9% less energy. This is one of the main reasons why Solana took on the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum right from the beginning.\n\nAbout Ethereum\n\nEthereum, or ETH, which was first proposed by Vitalik Buterin in his white paper in 2013, was finally launched in 2015. Buterin was joined by Gavin Wood, Charles Hoskinson, Amir Chetrit, Anthony Di Iorio, Jeffrey Wilcke, Joseph Lubin, and Mihai Alisie, who further developed and popularised the project its way to the second-largest blockchain project in the world, only behind Bitcoin.\n\nETH is the native currency of Ethereum, a decentralized blockchain that offers smart contract functionality. However, the project was also plagued with issues related to proof-of-work until September 2022, when it shifted to a proof-of-stake mechanism. The move helped it become more fast and reduced its energy needs by over 99%, making it more efficient.\n\nSolana Vs. Ethereum : An Overview\n\nSolana and Ethereum are two of the most widely used crypto tokens globally. But to better understand how these two crypto coins are pitting against each other, we have taken several factors into consideration to provide you with a detailed snapshot.\n\nGoogle Trends: Solana Vs Ethereum\n\nGoogle Trends is one of the key metrics to determine the interest of crypto enthusiasts in particular coins. For the past 12 months in 2023, Ethereum clearly has the edge over Solana in terms of search volumes and interest of the global crypto community.\n\nCaption: Interest over time of Solana and Ethereum {Solana (Blue); Ethereum (Red)}\n\nActive Addresses: Solana Vs. Ethereum\n\nActive Addresses is another important metric that can give you an insight into the adoption of a coin. In simple terms, an active address is a crypto address that has become a direct participant in a successful transaction. It can be either the sender’s or receiver’s address.\n\nActive Addresses Solana\n\nSolana’s active addresses, which peaked at around 39.64 million in April 2022, are nowhere close to its days of glory. However, the token has witnessed a decent rise in active addresses in the last 30 days. In October 2023, active addresses on Solana stood at 5.33 million as of 28 October.\n\nActive Addresses Ethereum\n\nThere’s no doubt that Ethereum is a more popular crypto coin than Solana. Therefore, naturally, the former has a more stable number of active addresses than the latter. In October, Ethereum’s number of active addresses was 10.35 million as of 28 October.\n\nMonthly Transactions (Solana & Ethereum)\n\nMonthly transactions in crypto refer to the buying, selling, and exchanging of digital currencies within a given month. Comparing Ethereum and Solana’s monthly transactions will help you understand which coin is being preferred for transactions by crypto enthusiasts.\n\nSolana Monthly Transactions\n\nNon-vote Solana transactions peaked in November 2021 at 1.5 billion. The last time it was near the 1 billion mark was in July 2022. The number of non-vote transactions has kept fluctuating since then. In October, the number of non-vote transactions showed improvement. As of 28 October, the number of non-vote transactions was up at 550.4 million from 494.7 million in September and 519.83 million in August 2023.\n\nEthereum Monthly Transactions\n\nIn terms of monthly transactions, Ethereum made a record in May 2021, when the token was involved in 20.27 transactions. While ETH’s number of transactions has fallen since then, it has remained stable in the range of 12 million to 17 million. However, in October, the number of Ethereum-based transactions could s...'}]

The Ethereum ecosystem and many others have chosen a modular vision where different blockchains specialize in the core functions of a layer-1 chain.\n\nOn the other hand, Solana has plowed ahead, trying to wring greater transaction throughput by optimizing every component of its own blockchain to be hyper-efficient. Consequently, Solana is vastly more capable than any of its legacy competitors regarding blockchain processing capabilities. Parallel to this, but much more importantly, Solana has translated its pioneering spirit into an ecosystem philosophy of risk-taking and techno-optimism.”\n\nThe analysts lay out three potential scenarios for Solana that could play out over the remainder of the 2020s: a bear, base and bullish case.\n\nVanEck centers its base case around the idea that Solana accounts for about 30% of all crypto adoption in 2030. The analysts also forecast that SOL monetizes at about 20% the rate of ETH and achieves less than half of ETH’s market shares due to a “fundamental difference in community philosophy.”\n\nIf Solana manages to stand on its own feet and steal more market value away from Ethereum, VanEck has a bull case of $3,211 per SOL by 2030, about a 100x move from today’s prices.\n\n“Were Solana to avoid Ethereum’s event horizon and achieve Ethereum-like dominance, our bull case reveals $51.8 billion in revenues and a $3,211 price target in 2030.”\n\nDon't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

VanEck explained no other chain fits that position other than Solana.\n\n“And the chain that hosts that killer application stands to benefit immensely from the activity generated by that app. In this note, we model a scenario in which Solana is the first blockchain to host a single application that onboards 100M+ users”, VanEck noted.\n\nNot yet at Ethereum or Polkadot’s level\n\nAs a result of the SCP dominance, Solana’s reign in terms of developer market share over other blockchains like Aptos [APT] has been very wide. The report noted that Solana’s increasing use case and “ground-breaking” technology have been responsible for the hike.\n\nHowever, when compared with the likes of Polkadot [DOT] and Ethereum, the Anatoly Yakovenko-led blockchain lagged behind. One reason Solana trailed here was because of the numerous times the network has experienced outages.\n\nVanEck also mentioned the complexity of the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) as one of the reasons the blockchain has been behind. The SVM is the system powering Solana’s ability to handle thousands of transactions per second.\n\nThe report explained the reason for the circumstance, highlighting that:\n\n“This is partly due to the need for Solana developers to be familiar with Rust, a language with 2.2M active developers, compared to Ethereum which can draw from the 17.4M JavaScript developers.”\n\nThe future could be brighter for SOL\n\nHowever, the asset management firm said it expected Solana to improve going forward especially as it has had a 100% uptime since March 2023. Meanwhile, Solana’s recovery and glaring potential were not just evident in VanEck’s report.\n\nArtemis, an institutional digital asset data platform, also noticed the project’s growth.\n\nAccording to a 26 October post on X (formerly Twitter), Artemis noted that it was “wowed” by Solana’s resurgence. Some of the metrics used in coming to this conclusion include the TVL, the DEX volume, active addresses, and transactions.\n\nOver the past week L1s have started to see a shift in sentiment.$SOL activity for the month has translated to sharp increased in DEX volume activity as TVL and users have seen an uptick. Is this the start of a new trend? pic.twitter.com/wfFyYlvBVS — Artemis (@artemis__xyz) October 26, 2023\n\nRealistic or not, here’s SOL’s market cap in ETH terms\n\nRegarding its price action, VanEck predicted that it could have an average trading value of $335 by 2030.\n\nBut in a bull phase, the report projected a jump to $3,211 in the same year. And in a torrid market condition, it noted that SOL won’t trade below $10.'}, {'id': 11, 'time': 'Sun, 29 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "What is Firedancer and Its Importance for Solana's Future - CryptoGlobe", 'content': 'Introduction\n\nFiredancer represents a fresh validator client designed for the Solana blockchain. At present, the entire Solana network relies on the original validator client, developed by Solana Labs. While this existing client is effective, it was created in a fast-paced startup setting, leaving room for optimization.\n\nJump Crypto, a division of the Jump Trading Group, which is a global leader in Web3 infrastructure development and investment, is developing this new client for Solana. Leveraging lessons learned from past experiences, the aim is to optimize performance within the given hardware constraints.\n\nCrucially, introducing an additional validator client significantly minimizes the risk of software glitches causing a network-wide outage. This added layer of security is likely to offer peace of mind to Solana Labs’ Co-Founder and CEO Anatoly Yakovenko.\n\nWhat Alchemy Says About Firedancer\n\nAccording to a report by Alchemy published back in January 2023, Firedancer is a groundbreaking validator client being developed for the Solana blockchain by Jump Crypto. Unlike Solana’s current single validator client, Firedancer aims to diversify the client ecosystem, enhancing the blockchain’s resilience. Alchemy notes that Firedancer is engineered for heightened performance and scalability, as evidenced by a November 2022 live demo where it processed 1.2 million transactions per second. Although still under development, Alchemy says that early tests suggest Firedancer could bring both redundancy and performance improvements to Solana.\n\nAlchemy states that the client is coded in C and C++, languages renowned for hardware performance and reliability. Initial releases will also be Rust-compatible, aligning with the language commonly used for Solana’s smart contracts. Firedancer is designed to tackle several existing limitations of Solana’s validator clients, such as limited concurrent transaction processing and an absence of sharding support. Alchemy highlights that Firedancer employs enhanced transaction processing techniques and includes sharding capabilities to boost scalability. Additionally, the client incorporates optimized networking and P2P communication protocols, achieved through methods like data compression and batching.\n\nAccording to Alchemy, Firedancer utilizes a modified version of Solana’s existing proof-of-stake consensus protocol, aiming for increased efficiency and reliability. The client’s advantages include improved performance and scalability, enhanced reliability, and the potential for reduced operating costs for node operators due to its efficiency. Its open-source framework allows for community input, offering avenues for further enhancements. However, Alchemy also identifies challenges, such as the client’s newness, which may come with bugs, and a learning curve for infrastructure providers adapting to this new client. Overall, Alchemy suggests that Firedancer’s features and initial test results indicate its transformative potential for the Solana network.\n\nWhat Messari Says About Firedancer\n\nMessari identifies scalability as a crucial issue in the cryptocurrency sector. While modular approaches are gaining traction, Solana has opted for a monolithic strategy. The network that solves this challenge will have a significant edge in achieving widespread adoption.\n\nAccording to Messari, Firedancer is a validator client in development by Jump Crypto, aiming to bolster Solana’s monolithic approach. Its first milestone, “fd_quic,” has shown impressive initial results, achieving a transaction throughput of 1 million TPS. However, Messari notes that further work is needed to realize Firedancer’s full potential.\n\nMessari elaborates that Firedancer aims to rewrite each component of Solana’s architecture. It addresses transaction propagation through its QUIC implementation, fd_quic, and achieves load balancing through hardware and software optimizations. Firedancer’s performance demo surpassed Solana’s recommended 12-core setup, achieving 1.08 million TPS with just four CPU cores.\n\nIf successful, Messari believes Firedancer could bring several benefits, including maturing the DeFi space by reducing latency and enabling Web2 applications on-chain with high throughput. This could benefit financial and consumer apps like social media.\n\nMessari points out that Firedancer could increase Solana’s chain robustness by introducing client diversity. With backup clients like Solana Labs and Jito Labs, the network can mitigate the risk of bugs and maintain performance even if Firedancer encounters issues.\n\nWhile Firedancer presents exciting opportunities, Messari also highlights the risks it faces. These include challenges in execution, timing, and competition. The ability of Jump Crypto to deliver on its roadmap and Solana’s ability to compete against Ethereum are significant factors to consider.'}]

Solana's price, according to data from CoinMarketCap, is pegged at $34.61, up by 7.41% over the past 24 hours. This growth comes at a time when Bitcoin (BTC) appears to be paring off its gains, an unsurprisingly bearish move.\n\nWhat Solana metrics show\n\nBesides this massive uptrend recorded overnight, Solana is also displaying an impressive trading volume. Per on-chain data, a total SOL worth $885,337,875 has been traded, amounting to a 116% jump in price. This massive interest as showcased by the trading volume underscores the attractiveness of Solana to both retail and institutional investors.\n\nSOL 1D Chart. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nSolana's daily chart, as depicted above shows a surge from $32.41 to its current price level on the back of the trading volume. Besides volume, Solana's total value locked (TVL) on its DeFi platforms also underscores the protocol has massive room for growth. Pegged at $394.16 million, Solana has the capacity for growth in the long term to catch up with its peers.\n\nOverall, Solana has maintained as much as a 241% year-to-date (YTD) growth, leaving behind its top competitors, like Cardano (ADA), as the protocol continues to welcome bullish predictions for the coming months and years.\n\nPotential SOL price target\n\nWith the current price outlook, Solana is currently trading at its highest price level for the month. However, with the coin in a price discovery level, we can see it touch a high of $40, a feat that, if achieved, will mark its highest level since June 2022.\n\nSolana has obvious whale actions, predictions and fundamentals within its ecosystem that can help it achieve this historic price growth in the near future."}, {'id': 15, 'time': 'Mon, 30 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'This Solana-based token has rallied by 101% in a week and could reignite the meme coin rally - FXStreet', 'content': 'Solana price rally is highly anticipated as the protocol-organized developer conference Breakpoint began on Monday.\n\nMemecoin BONK, which is less than a year old, is up by 101% in the past week in anticipation of Breakpoint.\n\nBONK price rally could either induce bullishness in DOGE, SHIB, and other meme coins, or a liquidity crisis could cause a rapid crash.\n\nSolana is making the headlines with Breakpoint at the moment as the month of crypto conferences is upon us.

The token, which is based on the “Bonk” meme, has rallied by more than 100% in just seven days, entering the watchlist of analysts.\n\nBONK/USD 1-day chart\n\nWhile the Bitcoin ETF-fuelled rally pushed many tokens upward, BONK stands out for the potential it represents in the crypto market. The cryptocurrency is the first meme coin in a long time to post such gains in such a short span. More than the rise, the demand for Bonk is also rather significant.\n\nIn the last 24 hours, the memecoin has observed investors conducting transactions consistently, generating volume worth over $19.5 million. Given that the total market capitalization of Bonk at the time of writing is a little under $34.5 million, the 24-hour volume alone is worth more than half the value of the entire circulating supply of BONK.\n\nBONK market capitalization and 24-hour trading volume\n\nThis, according to popular analyst Miles Deutscher, is both a potentially great and terrible development. As he stated on X, formerly Twitter,\n\n“There are 2 scenarios here: 1. SOL tops around Breakpoint, and BONK retraces even further - fitting my SOL short-term short bias. Or, 2. This is the start of a proper move, and memecoins gain steam.\n\nPut simply, since the volume of the transactions conducted in a day is so high in comparison to the market capitalization of BONK, a liquidity crisis is not too far from the realm of reality. But if the meme coin manages to avoid that and keep on rallying, it could induce bullishness in its peers such as Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Floki Inu.\n\nWatch out for Solana price rise too\n\nSince Breakpoint is the first major event conducted by Solana since the FTX collapse last November, a lot of pressure sits atop its shoulders. The success or failure of the event could translate to either a rally or a crash in Solana price, which is why the altcoin is currently on the hot list of many analysts and traders who are looking to both long and short the asset.\n\nIn a bullish scenario, SOL is expected to shoot up from $34 to $37 and likely even breach $40, while a bearish outcome would result in the “Ethereum killer” falling below $30, potentially hitting $26.\n\nRead more about Solana price’s targets here - SOL pumps 7%, records highest daily close since FTX went down as Solana Breakpoint conference commences'}, {'id': 2, 'time': 'Mon, 30 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Solana's SOL Price Predicted to Surpass $3000 in Bullish Scenario by 2030 - Blockchain News", 'content': 'A detailed analysis by VanEck, a major asset management firm, sketches various valuation scenarios for Solana (SOL) by the year 2030, amid the blockchain\'s remarkable performance and its strive for scalability , dated October 27, 2023.\n\nVanEck\'s examination lays out three potential SOL price paths by 2030: a bearish $9.81, a bullish $3,211.28, and a base case of $335, driven by diverse market shares and revenue estimations across key sectors. This is part of a broader scenario where Solana emerges as the first blockchain to host an application with over 100 million users. Despite the envisioned lower monetization rate at 20% of Ethereum\'s (ETH) and smaller market shares due to community philosophy differences, there\'s a credible trajectory to $8 billion in revenues for SOL token holders by the end of the decade.\n\nCentral to Solana\'s promise is its technical prowess, particularly in scaling blockchain operations. Through rigorous optimization, Solana achieves higher transaction throughput, surpassing many legacy competitors. This technical edge extends to its data throughput capacity, a critical metric for blockchain efficacy, which is slated for a tenfold increase with the upcoming Firedancer upgrade. The blockchain\'s unique features like Local Fee Markets further refine the user experience by effectively managing transaction costs and system congestion.\n\nSolana\'s innovative spirit has birthed an array of ventures, such as blockchain-optimized mobile phones and consumer-centric applications like decentralized mapping. Its initial vision of becoming a "Decentralized Nasdaq" has broadened with the advent of intriguing non-financial applications, underpinned by partnerships with industry giants like Shopify, Visa, and Google, which augment its ecosystem.\n\nHowever, sustainability concerns loom. A glaring discrepancy between Solana’s revenue ($1.26 million) and blockchain security costs ($52.78 million) over a recent 30-day period underscores the pressing need for a more balanced financial framework. The continuous influx of speculative capital to offset validator selling pressure, against a backdrop of minuscule transaction fees, paints a challenging picture for long-term economic viability.\n\nSolana\'s journey is also marred by technical instabilities, with notable network downtimes between January 2022 and February 2023. Despite subsequent improvements, the complexity of Solana\'s design, coupled with a high bar of programming proficiency, hinders a broader developer engagement. The blockchain\'s share of active crypto developers has stagnated around 6-7% over the last 18 months, which might impede its ambition to host tomorrow\'s blockbuster applications.\n\nUtilizing a standardized valuation framework, VanEck projects a base SOL token valuation of $335 by 2030, based on an expected real rate of return applied to the terminal year\'s Free Cash Flow. The projection, however, is pinned on substantial growth in user and developer adoption, which presently trails that of Ethereum. The potential implementation of token-voting governance by 2030 could enhance SOL token economics, provided a vibrant ecosystem activity ensues.\n\nSolana, with its relentless focus on user-centric innovations and blockchain efficiency, offers a compelling narrative. Yet, its path to significant valuation and ecosystem growth is fraught with technical, financial, and developer adoption challenges that require diligent addressing to ensure a robust and sustainable blockchain platform through 2030 and beyond.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock\n\n. . .\n\nTags'}, {'id': 4, 'time': 'Mon, 30 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Solana at Over $3,000 by 2030?

The ‘Base, Bear, Bull Case’ features an in-depth look into Solana’s unique value proposition within the world of Web3.\n\nTo summarize the content before getting into its reasoning, VanEck believes that SOL could hit $3,000 per token under the right circumstances. This projection represents the bull case for SOL, with the bear case being as low as $10.\n\nThe major discrepancy between the bull case and the bear case for SOL should come as little surprise. Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies are experimental technologies — while they certainly have major potential to disrupt the digital landscape, they also contain risks that are inherent in the process of discovery.\n\nVanEck clarified that it has investment exposure to SOL. The financial analysts believe that Solana is one of the more promising blockchain networks due to its unique capacity to scale the decentralized web, stating that there is a “credible path” towards $8bn in revenue for Solana by 2030.\n\nVanEck’s Base, Bear, Bull Case for Solana (SOL)\n\nSolana could be the most efficient blockchain in Web3, but is demand the missing link?\n\nVanEck highlighted Solana’s scalability potential as the underlying value proposition of the blockchain. The layer-1 network currently processes more data than any of its competitors and is soon releasing its Firedancer upgrade that will multiply this statistic by a factor of 10. VanEck believes that, after Firedancer is implemented, Solana will be far and away the most efficient blockchain in Web3.\n\nSolana was specifically designed to meet the requirements of consumer-based dApps. It offers ultra-low transaction fees and rapid block confirmations, being able to process transactions in as little as 2 seconds for less than $0.01. Its main problem is that no dApps have so far been able to attract the level of demand that this kind of performance is able to support.\n\nSolana outperforms other blockchains when measuring data throughput\n\nInfrastructure projects such as digital asset exchanges and L1/L2 blockchains often support the highest number of on-chain users by far. dApps, however, rarely support more than 100,000 users at a time. Some notable exceptions to these conditions are the highest-rated GameFi titles — Axie Infinity and Splinterlands, for example, each attracted more than 1 million daily active users at their peak.\n\nHowever, Axie Infinity and Splinterlands’ figures are still extremely low compared to the most-used web apps in the world. VanEck referenced “2bn monthly Facebook users and 431m monthly PayPal users” to show the gulf in demand between on-chain services and traditional web apps at this moment in time.\n\nVanEck believes that this discrepancy highlights Solana’s long term potential. Solana has the unique capacity to support dApps that can truly scale to the same level as the most popular web apps in the world. VanEck therefore sees Solana’s scalability as a fundamental reason why it could be the blockchain that delivers global adoption.\n\nHowever, the gap between Solana’s scalability potential and its current user base is seen as a major hurdle for the project to overcome. Solana suffers from operating losses due to the high costs of running its network infrastructure combined with low revenue generation from relatively few users and sub-cent transaction fees.\n\nUnless Solana can successfully match its costly high-performance network with truly scaled demand, then it may struggle to ever turn a profit as an organization.\n\nThe cost of running Solana’s high performance blockchain is high, and the network operates at a loss due to its low transaction fees\n\nBottom line: VanEck’s Base, Bear, Bull Case highlights a key hurdle for Solana to overcome if it is to be successful long-term\n\nThe major discrepancy between VanEck’s bear case and bull case boils down to a gulf between the blockchain’s potential to support users and its actual usership rates in 2023. At this moment in time, Solana operates at a loss that is unsustainable over the long-term, and it therefore must match its highly scalable network with equally popular dApps if it’s ever going to achieve its potential.\n\nThat said, the blockchain industry’s rapid rate of adoption bodes well.

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that ETH is currently experiencing a downward trend with consistent "sell" signals from the MACD indicator. The decrease in total transactions and successful transactions further supports the lack of bullish momentum and potential for further price declines. 

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights a positive outlook for Solana (SOL) with bullish sentiment and potential for a rally continuation. The technical analysis and positive developments surrounding SOL suggest a market trend that is likely to be bullish in the near term.

While short-term gains may be tempting, prioritizing long-term strategies and effective risk management is key to maximizing overall profit in the long run.

Considering the current market conditions and the potential for a bullish trend in SOL, I would take a slightly conservative approach and allocate more resources towards SOL while reducing exposure to ETH. Therefore, my trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.7, indicating a moderate level of confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.

GameShift, initially announced as a Solana Labs initiative in July 2023 , is now available for developers to begin building a Web3-powered gaming experience with a single, easy-to-use API built on Solana, without the need for blockchain coding or knowledge.\n\nHistorically, game development on-chain has been riddled with obstacles and pain points, including the tremendous knowledge requirements needed to successfully build applications on-chain. These hurdles require developers to expend time, energy, and money into the backend game development, often at the cost of game quality. Solana Labs\' GameShift eliminates the need for extensive blockchain knowledge through a unified Web2-friendly API. This familiar architecture allows developers to focus on what matters most: game creation.\n\n"Integrating GameShift\'s API to handle blockchain complexity under the hood allows developers to dedicate more resources directly to game development," said Davis Hart, Product Lead for GameShift. "Even more importantly, developers can provide a Web2-friendly experience to gamers, easing the common Web3 frictions that can deter user acquisition and engagement."\n\nGameShift lessens the complexity of working with blockchains, including content storage, gas fees, and smart contract implementation. With GameShift, in-game assets can be listed, purchased and traded in a seamless, branded in-game marketplace, without ever holding crypto. Transactions can be made in USD through credit card payments. GameShift is powered by Solana Labs with support from ecosystem partners including Crossmint, Coinflow, and Metakeep.\n\nGameShift represents yet another innovation on the Solana network that emphasizes developer and user experiences by leveraging the network\'s unique advantages to pursue mass adoption. Solana offers ultra-fast speeds and true scalability, as well as ultra-low cost for game asset minting, transfer, and trading, making the network the premier choice for the next generation of gaming.\n\nGameShift\'s beta launch was announced during the Solana Foundation\'s premier annual event, Breakpoint, which celebrates the achievements and innovations of the entire Solana community. Breakpoint 2023, hosted in Amsterdam, features key notes, panels, demos, and more from industry and Solana community leaders.\n\nFor more information on GameShift, visit Gameshift.SolanaLabs.com .\n\nAbout Solana Labs\n\nSolana Labs is a technology company, a developer of web3 projects, a creator of open-source software, and the author and publisher of a Solana validator client.

Since marking a bottom below $8 on December 29, the SOL price has risen more than 395%. And news from the Solana Breakpoint conference, which is currently being held in Amsterdam from October 30 to November 3, 2023, further fueled the price yesterday. In the last 24 hours, the price has risen 7.5%, and a whopping 23% in the last seven days.\n\nFiredancer Launched On Solana Testnet\n\nCentral to the current excitement is the launch of Firedancer on Solana’s testnet. This new validator client, designed for the Solana blockchain, promises to significantly improve the scalability of the network, diminish latency times, and overall enhance network performance.\n\nThe brain behind Firedancer Solana is Jump Crypto, a division of the Jump Trading Group, dedicated to pioneering solutions in the blockchain space. Their vision for Firedancer is comprehensive. It is designed to refine the Solana network across all tiers, starting from its foundational consensus mechanism to its broadest performance metrics. Ultimately, Firedancer aims to scale Solana to one million transactions per second (TPS).\n\nRelated Reading\n\nSolana Flying, Bulls Reverse Post-FTX Collapse Losses But SOL Analysts Cautious 6 months ago\n\nHighlighting the criticality of Firedancer to the future roadmap of Solana, Dan Albert, Executive Director of the Solana Foundation, proclaimed during his live stage appearance at the conference, “These guys have been hustling hard. Really did a lot of work, working around the clock in the last couple of weeks and I am really excited to announce that right now the first version of Firedancer is live on testnet.”\n\nValidating this enthusiasm, Raoul Pal, CEO and co-founder of Real Vision Group and former Goldman Sachs executive, expressed his bullish outlook, stating:\n\nFiredancer is a VERY big deal, not just for Solana but for blockchain technology overall. It is a quantum leap in speed (10x faster than the fastest blockchain today) whilst increasing security and robustness of the Solana Virtual Machine [SVM]. We’re eagerly awaiting its migration to Mainnet in the summer of 2024.\n\nPal further encapsulated the potential of Solana and Firedancer in a recent conversation with Scott Melker. He opined, “I’ve been observing the charts, particularly Solana versus ETH (SOL/ETH) and Solana versus Bitcoin (SOL/BTC), and it unmistakably resembles a rocket ship in its ascent. It’s truly astonishing.”\n\nRelated Reading\n\nSOL Price Breaks Multi-Month Trend\n\nHowever, in the midst of this euphoria, some analysts urge caution. With SOL’s price surging to touch a 1-year high of $39.88 yesterday, analyst Pentoshi offered a sobering perspective, noting, “SOL takes out these equal highs at the top of the range and in the next couple weeks likely a chance to refuel at the mid-range at $32.xx.”\n\nIn addition, the 1-day chart shows that SOL broke out of an ascending trend channel (black) in a very bullish manner. SOL rose yesterday above the late October high of $38.78, which the price marked just before it plummeted in the wake of FTX’s collapse, losing more than 68% in four days.\n\nThe next few days will be all about closing above $38.78 for the SOL bulls. If this succeeds, the Fibonacci extension level of 1.618 at $57.85 could be the next major target. Otherwise, a correction toward the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level at $32.18 could be in the cards.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com'}]

Based on the recent data, the open price of ETH has been fluctuating between 31.65 and 38.51. The total transactions have been decreasing gradually, indicating a decrease in trading activity. The successful transactions have also been declining, suggesting a decrease in investor confidence. The MACD signal has consistently been indicating a sell trend.

NEWS ANALYST REPORT:
"""
The news articles suggest a positive outlook for Solana (SOL) in the cryptocurrency market. The collaboration with Google Cloud's BigQuery for data analytics, the development of Firedancer to enhance scalability, and the beta launch of GameShift for Web3 gaming all indicate strong growth potential for Solana. Additionally, the movement of assets by bankrupt FTX, including Ethereum and Solana, may have a positive impact on SOL's value. The price of SOL has been on a significant uptrend, with a potential target of $57.85 if it closes above $38.78. Overall, these developments and market trends indicate a bullish sentiment for Solana in the near future.

"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the current trend for ETH is bearish, with decreasing open prices, total transactions, and successful transactions. The MACD signal consistently showing a sell further supports the notion that the ETH price is likely to continue decreasing in the near future. On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights the positive outlook for Solana (SOL) as a competitor to ETH, with significant growth potential and bullish price targets.

In reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a slightly conservative approach focusing on long-term growth opportunities and effective risk management has been successful in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. While short-term gains may be tempting, it is crucial to prioritize long-term strategies and monitor key indicators such as on-chain analysis, MACD signals, and news sentiment.

Considering the current market conditions and uncertainties, I would recommend taking a slightly conservative approach and holding onto ETH positions for the long term. While the short-term trend may be bearish, the potential growth and development of SOL as highlighted in the news report suggest a positive market trend in the long run. Therefore, my trading action would be to hold onto ETH with a confidence level of 0.3, indicating a moderate level of confidence in the long-term growth potential of the cryptocurrency market.

The architecture of Solana facilitates the processing of these trades, aiming for efficiency, security, and accuracy.\n\nSolana introduces a mechanism known as proof of history (PoH), setting it apart from some traditional consensus methods. PoH is designed to generate a historical record to verify the occurrence of an event at a specific time.\n\nThis is achieved by encoding the passage of time in the data before it becomes a part of the ledger. The intention is to streamline the consensus-reaching process across nodes, as they have a shared, trusted notion of time.\n\nThis emphasis on time-saving is further realized in Solana’s Tower BFT, a byzantine fault-tolerant derivative of the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus.\n\nTower BFT utilizes the synchronized clock provided by PoH to reduce messaging overhead and latency. This allows for faster confirmations of transactions without compromising on security.\n\nSolana also features the Gulf Stream protocol, which attempts to optimize transaction handling by pre-processing and sending them to validators prior to the completion of the previous transaction set. This approach is intended to reduce confirmation times and improve network efficiency.\n\nWhen considering all these mechanisms together, Solana aims to support a high volume of transactions per second, positioning itself as a competitive entity in the blockchain space.\n\nSolana’s tokenomics: understanding SOL’s role and distribution\n\nSolana’s financial structure is centered around its native token, SOL. This token has multiple functions within the network. The primary use of SOL is for transactions and for users to interact with dApps on the Solana platform.\n\nSimply put, if a user wants to carry out an operation or use a dApp on Solana, they need SOL.\n\nYou might also like: Solana close to 1-year high amid declining open interest\n\nStaking is another important function of SOL. Users can help secure the network by staking their SOL tokens. They can do this by either becoming validators themselves or by assigning their tokens to existing validators.\n\nThose who stake their tokens are rewarded, and the annual percentage yield (APY) for this is typically between 7-8%. However, it’s important to mention that this rate can change based on several factors.\n\nValidators play a crucial role in the network’s security. They receive new SOL tokens as rewards, as well as a share of transaction fees. This approach encourages active participation in the network and aims to ensure its stability.\n\nRegarding the distribution of SOL, recent data shows that out of a total supply of 561 million tokens, about 420 million are in circulation. This implies that approximately 141 million SOL tokens have been burned over time.\n\nSolana use cases\n\nSolana’s blockchain technology has nurtured a variety of use cases due to its high scalability and low transaction fees. Here are some notable use cases:\n\nDecentralized finance (defi)\n\nSolana’s high throughput and low transaction fees make it a fertile ground for defi applications like DEXs, lending protocols, and digital wallets. Examples include Solana-based DEXs like Orca and Serum, and lending platforms like Apricot Finance and Solend\u200b.\n\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs)\n\nSolana facilitates the creation of NFT platforms and marketplaces where users can mint, buy, and sell NFTs. Notable platforms include Metaplex and Solanart, which all...'}]

SOL has done pretty well, but investors want more than that.\n\nEverlodge (ELDG): Could It Leave Cardano and Solana Behind?\n\nWhile Cardano and Solana have distinct strengths and use cases, Everlodge (ELDG) will bring a novel concept – fractional real estate ownership on the blockchain.\n\nTraditionally, high entry barriers have excluded many investors from this lucrative market. With Everlodge, anyone can own a piece of premium real estate, from luxurious vacation homes to hotels, using blockchain tech. It accomplishes this by digitizing and minting these properties into NFTs and fractionalizing them. Thus, anyone can buy them for prices as low as $100.\n\nAlso, members of the Everlodge Rewards Club can earn free nightly stays across various properties and even generate a passive income by reselling these nights. But, only ELDG native token holders will gain access to this Club.\n\nCurrently, in its sixth presale stage with a price of $0.023, Everlodge is already attracting attention.

This digital asset, often referred to as an “altcoin,” is making waves in the market, but it’s not without its ups and downs. In the last 24 hours, Solana experienced an 8% dip, leaving many investors and analysts pondering its true potential.\n\nCryptocurrency markets have always been a rollercoaster, with prices surging and plummeting at seemingly random intervals. This volatile nature makes it challenging for both seasoned investors and newcomers to predict the future of any particular cryptocurrency accurately. Solana, however, seems to have distinguished itself by making headlines for its recent impressive rally.\n\nIs Solana’s recent surge a mere rebound, or does it signify a bright future for this altcoin? Let’s delve deeper into the factors that are propelling Solana’s newfound prominence and what potential lies ahead for this digital asset.\n\nSolana’s Meteoric Rise\n\nSolana, often referred to as a rising star among altcoins, has experienced a remarkable 27% surge in its value over the past week. This surge has garnered significant attention in the cryptocurrency community, drawing in both new and experienced investors.\n\nWhat sets Solana apart from other cryptocurrencies is its unique approach to blockchain technology. Solana aims to address some of the inherent limitations of blockchain networks, such as slow transaction speeds and high fees. It achieves this by utilizing a unique consensus mechanism known as “proof-of-history” in conjunction with the more traditional “proof-of-stake” model.\n\nThe proof-of-history mechanism, a novel addition to Solana’s architecture, timestamps transactions and events within the network, creating an immutable historical record. This innovation significantly enhances the network’s efficiency, allowing for faster transaction processing and increased scalability. Solana’s emphasis on speed and efficiency has made it an attractive option for developers and users alike.\n\nSolana’s Ups and Downs\n\nDespite its recent success, Solana hasn’t been immune to the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. In the last 24 hours alone, it experienced an 8% dip in its value, leaving investors and analysts uncertain about its near-term prospects.\n\nThis sudden dip raises questions about Solana’s ability to maintain its upward momentum. Many investors are wary of a potential bubble, while others see this dip as a healthy correction after a period of rapid growth.\n\nIs Solana Undervalued?\n\nSome experts argue that Solana’s recent impressive rally is simply a rebound after being undervalued for an extended period. They point out that the project’s unique features and innovative technology may have been overlooked until recently, leading to a price surge as more investors discover its potential.\n\nSolana’s blockchain technology is not only fast but also cost-effective, addressing some of the fundamental issues that have plagued other blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Its potential applications extend to various industries, including decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and gaming.\n\nThe Ethereum network, for example, has faced congestion and high gas fees, making it less suitable for some applications. Solana’s emergence as a viable alternative with fast transaction speeds and lower fees has attracted developers and users looking for a more efficient platform. This has contributed to its recent surge in popularity.\n\nThe Role of the Ecosystem\n\nA key driver behind Solana’s rise is its vibrant and growing ecosystem. An ecosystem comprises the network’s infrastructure, applications, and users. Solana’s ecosystem has been rapidly expanding, with various decentralized applications (dApps) and projects being built on the platform.\n\nDecentralized finance, or DeFi, has been one of the most significant drivers of growth for Solana. DeFi projects aim to create financial services without traditional intermediaries, and many of them have found Solana’s architecture to be a favorable environment for their operations. Solana’s infrastructure can handle a high volume of transactions, making it well-suited for DeFi applications, such as decentralized exchanges (DEXs), lending platforms, and yield farming.\n\nNFTs, another hot trend in the crypto space, have also found a home on Solana. NFT platforms built on Solana offer faster and cheaper transactions, making it an attractive choice for artists, collectors, and creators in the digital art and collectibles space.\n\nChallenges and Concerns\n\nWhile Solana’s recent success is undeniable, it faces its fair share of challenges and concerns. The cryptocurrency market is highly speculative, and even promising projects can experience sudden price fluctuations. Solana’s competitors, such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polkadot, also pose a threat. These platforms are constantly evolving and improving to address ...'}]

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the market trend for ETH is uncertain, with a potential for a slight downturn in the near future. The MACD signal indicating a sell trend and the resistance in successful transactions suggest a bearish sentiment in the market.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights positive market trends for Bitcoin and Solana's SOL token, with both showing potential for further growth in the near future. The bullish outlook for SOL, driven by significant developments and optimistic market sentiment, indicates a positive trajectory for the token.

In reflection, a slightly conservative approach focusing on long-term growth opportunities and effective risk management has been successful in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. Key indicators such as on-chain analysis, MACD signals, and news sentiment have played a crucial role in making informed trading decisions.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is advisable to adopt a long-term strategy over short-term gains. The positive market trends for Bitcoin and Solana's SOL token, coupled with the uncertain outlook for ETH, suggest a strategic focus on potential growth opportunities in the long run.

Therefore, my trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.7, reflecting a cautious approach towards the uncertain market trend for ETH and a strategic decision to manage risk effectively in the current market environment.
ACTION:

REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that ETH has been on a downward trend with decreasing open prices and a bearish MACD signal indicating a potential continuation of this trend.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights the positive outlook for Solana, with its recent surge in price, technological advancements, and growing user base positioning it as a strong competitor to Ethereum. The bullish trend for Solana is expected to continue, attracting more investors and users to the platform.

In reflection of the reports, it is evident that a slightly conservative approach focusing on long-term growth opportunities and effective risk management has been successful in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market.

After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that ETH is currently experiencing a downward trend with a lack of confidence in the market, as indicated by the successful transactions not increasing proportionally and the consistent sell indication from the MACD signal. On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights positive market trends for cryptocurrencies in general, with potential growth opportunities but also risks of volatility and competition.

Taking into account the reflection analyst report, which emphasizes a slightly conservative approach focusing on long-term growth opportunities and effective risk management, it is important to consider the overall market sentiment and potential risks associated with trading ETH in the current environment. While there are opportunities for growth, it is crucial to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains to navigate the volatile cryptocurrency market successfully.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is advisable to adopt a cautious approach towards trading ETH and focus on long-term growth opportunities while managing risks effectively. Therefore, my trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.5, reflecting a moderate level of uncertainty in the market trend and a strategic decision to prioritize risk management and long-term growth over short-term gains.

A node operator is either a miner or validator on a network.\n\nRead Render’s [RNDR] Price Prediction 2024-2025\n\nOperators over airdrop hunters\n\nWhether validator or miner, node operators are responsible for managing and monitoring information stored on the blockchain. Render’s announcement comes days after it disclosed that it was collaborating with compute clients on Solana [SOL].\n\nNice launch @ionet_official ! Welcome to @solana Render Foundation Announces Compute Client Incentives of 1.14M RNDR Render Foundation Announces 1.14 Million RNDR Incentive Program for Node Operators on https://t.co/S8Zu3iZfhH and Other Compute Clients, Node Waitlist Open… — The Render Network (@rendernetwork) November 3, 2023\n\nFor context, a compute client is used to connect a node on a particular blockchain with another node on another network. Hence, Render’s integration with Solana means that it is dedicated to preventing transaction failure.\n\nFurthermore, Render Foundation’s decision to reward node operators means the project holds the group in high esteem. Some time ago, the project informed the crypto community that it did not plan on airdropping tokens like others may have done.\n\nDespite that, AMBCrypto reported how great the project had done in terms of adoption. Also, RNDR’s price action has not been left out of the party. Between 13 October and 2 November, Render’s network growth climbed from 136 to 503.\n\nNetwork growth tracks the number of new addresses interacting on a network. The metric is used to gauge tracking on a project. Therefore, the hike suggests an increase in advocacy for the Render.\n\nDecreasing demand for RNDR is not the end\n\nAs shown above, the metric had plunged, indicating a decline in traction. This decrease in demand for RNDR could also be linked to the cryptocurrency’s 2.94% fall in the last seven days.\n\nBut with the Solana partnership, RNDR could be back with an upward movement. The reason for this is that Solana has become one of the best performers of the past few months. In addition, projects linked to it have followed the same path.\n\nOn 31 October, Render’s social dominance reached a height of 12.45%. This meant that the crypto community had eyes on the token especially as the value surged to almost 100% at that time. Gaining insights into other promising AI crypto projects can complement your understanding of Render’s growth trajectory.\n\nHowever, its social dominance has dropped at press time, indicating a recent oversight. But traders might need to watch out for RNDR in the coming weeks. Should the token build on its 6.95% 24-hour growth, then it may be time to expect a rally again.\n\nRealistic or not, here’s RNDR’s market cap in SOL terms\n\nRender’s market cap is also one metric market participants may want to watch out for. Based on CoinMarketCap’s data, the project was ranked 52 with a market cap of $866.10 million.\n\nIn the next few months, this value could increase depending on RNDR’s circulation, the narrative around its fundamentals, and certain developments.'}, {'id': 12, 'time': 'Sun, 05 Nov 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Beyond Solana (SOL) And THORChain (RUNE): The Contender For Crypto Dominance In 2024 - The Crypto Basic', 'content': 'In 2024, the crypto market is poised for intense competition, with VC Spectra (SPCT) emerging as a strong contender against established players like Solana (SOL) and THORChain (RUNE).

This development addresses past network outages by implementing multiple, independent code sets to run the chain, significantly reducing the risk of simultaneous bugs and improving overall network stability.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nFurthermore, the SOL crypto price jumped significantly in the last week of October, partly due to FTX unstaking $67 million worth of tokens and growing investor confidence as one of the best DeFi projects. SOL crypto price rose 32% in a week, breaking the resistance level of $25 and then surpassing $40, reaching a 14-month high.\n\nAt the start of November, Solana (SOL) was trading around $42 and might soon test this level. The MACD shows strong positive momentum, suggesting continued price growth. If Solana (SOL) maintains this trajectory, SOL crypto price could quickly surpass $45 and reach $50. However, a bearish shift could see the Solana (SOL) could fall to a support level of $35. Crypto experts believe Solana (SOL) will trade around an average of $70 in 2024.\n\nTHORChain (RUNE) Witnesses Huge Price Surge\n\nTHORChain (RUNE), one of the top altcoins, has seen huge growth attributed to solid on-chain fundamentals. A significant factor is the record-high burning of THORChain (RUNE) tokens, with a notable 125 thousand RUNE burned on October 29. This burning, driven by increased lending and platform usage, creates upward price pressure.\n\nTHORChain (RUNE) price prediction for November 2023 is strongly bullish, following a 34% rise in the past 30 days. At the start of November, THORChain (RUNE) was trading around $2.90. The RUNE price broke the $2.75 resistance and maintained a sustained uptrend above key EMAs.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nWhile a short-term retracement is possible, the rally appears robust. If THORChain (RUNE) surpasses resistance at $3.10, more upside potential is expected. The bullish trend is supported by technical indicators, suggesting a move towards the $3.50 at the start of 2024. The long-term outlook of THORChain (RUNE) remains positive, with significant support at $2.80.\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) Is Set to Shine in 2024\n\nAs a rising star in the crypto world, VC Spectra (SPCT) is making waves with its innovative approach. Having raised $2.4 million in its seed and private sale, VC Spectra’s public presale shows promising growth, with the SPCT token price already up by 587.5%. Surpassing its initial target of $0.080, the SPCT token is poised for greater heights as it prepares to hit significant exchanges post-presale.\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) stands out with its decentralized trading platform and asset management protocol, designed on a secure, transparent blockchain infrastructure. This platform allows investors to trade and manage assets peer-to-peer without needing intermediaries. It’s a game-changer in how blockchain technology is utilized, offering a more accessible and controlled investment environment.\n\nWhat sets VC Spectra (SPCT) apart is its commitment to sustainable and ethical investments. The platform only supports new ICOs that adhere to these values, ensuring a positive impact on society and the environment. This ethical approach is about good business and shaping a better future through responsible investing.\n\nVC Spectra (SPCT) caters to a diverse range of investors, from individuals to institutional clients, who seek high-return investments aligned with sustainability and ethical principles. As the crypto landscape evolves, VC Spectra’s (SPCT) blend of innovation, security, and ethical investment practices positions it as a potential leader in the industry for 2024 and beyond.\n\nLearn more about the VC Spectra presale here:\n\nPresale\n\nWebsite\n\nTelegram\n\nTwitter'}]

"""
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that ETH has been on a downward trend with decreasing open prices and a bearish MACD signal indicating a potential continuation of this trend. The fluctuating total transactions and lack of increase in successful transactions also suggest a decrease in market confidence.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights the positive outlook for Solana, with its recent surge in price, technological advancements, and growing user base positioning it as a strong competitor to Ethereum. The bullish trend for Solana is expected to continue, attracting more investors and users to the platform.

In reflection of the reports, it is evident that a slightly conservative approach focusing on long-term growth opportunities and effective risk management has been successful in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. The uncertain trend for ETH and the bullish outlook for Solana suggest a strategic focus on potential growth opportunities in the long run.

Therefore, considering the market trend and the emphasis on long-term strategies over short-term gains, I would take a slightly conservative approach and sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.5 to manage risk effectively and maximize overall profit in the current market environment.

After reviewing the on-chain, news, and reflection analyst reports, it is clear that there are mixed signals in the cryptocurrency market. The on-chain analysis for ETH suggests a bearish trend with a potential decline in price, while the news analysis highlights bullish trends for SOL, SPCT, and RUNE. The reflection report emphasizes the importance of a slightly conservative approach focusing on long-term growth opportunities and effective risk management.

Therefore, my trading action would be to buy ETH with a confidence level of 0.3.

As CryptoPotato reported last week, Solana’s network has surpassed Polygon in daily decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume.\n\nThe former registered a volume of over $240 million, while the latter sat at approximately $137 million.\n\nIn addition, SOL has captured the interest of institutional investors.

Investors can anticipate a spike in sell pressure when FTX begins to sell its SOL holdings if they have not done so already.\n\nMoreover, Solana (SOL) had recently dropped 9% in the daily charts right after FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s guilty verdict announcement.

This impressive momentum has sparked a flurry of speculation and analysis within the crypto community, leading many to ponder a tantalizing question: Could Solana’s robust performance herald its ascent to the coveted $100 mark within 2023?\n\nIn this update, we delve into the factors driving Solana’s surge, examining its technological underpinnings, market trends, and expert forecasts to present a comprehensive Solana price prediction for the year ahead\n\nSolana Price Prediction\n\nAs of today, Solana trades at $40.40, a modest retreat from the recent highs. This level reflects a pullback of 3.10% over the past 24 hours. Despite the slight downturn, Solana’s robust market capitalization, currently at approximately $16.97 billion, maintains its stature as the seventh-largest digital asset.\n\nThe 4-hour chart unfolds an interesting narrative. The pivot point at $40.12 suggests a pivotal moment for the asset, with immediate resistance solidifying at $47.83. A breach of this level could clear the path towards the next resistance echelons at $54.40 and possibly $62.10.\n\nConversely, if the bears take control, we might see Solana testing the support at $33.55, with further declines potentially leading to $26.08 and $19.28.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI), currently at 49, hovers around the midpoint, signaling a neutral sentiment that leaves room for movement in either direction. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) stands at $38.54, providing a cushion just below the current price level and offering a bullish signal as the price is perched above this moving average.\n\nAn upward channel is discernible, indicating sustained bullish sentiment over recent periods. Additionally, candlestick analysis reflects a potential cooling-off period following a significant uptrend, as evidenced by the consolidation pattern around the current price point.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith a general upward trend above the $38 mark, the bias remains bullish. In the short term, we could anticipate Solana testing higher resistance levels, contingent on market sentiment and volume support. Market participants may look towards the upper band of the channel for potential targets while staying vigilant for any shifts in momentum that might signal a trend reversal.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX): Last Chance Alert\n\nExplore the groundbreaking realm of Bitcoin Minetrix with its unique stake-to-mine model – as the presale impressively surpasses the $3.4 million mark.

Many have sought to innovate on top of Solana's existing infrastructure in various ways. The network's goal of supporting the emergence of decentralized scalable applications through faster transactions and lower fees saw Solana rise in popularity, along with its native token, SOL.\n\nAfter weathering volatility brought by the crypto downturn of 2022, developers built the Bonk Inu (BONK) memecoin on the Solana network as a catalyst to help bring fresh liquidity into the network. This guide will explore what Bonk Inu is, its token, and how it compares to other memecoins.\n\nWhat Is Bonk Inu (BONK)?\n\nBonk Inu (BONK) is a dog-themed memecoin designed to support the Solana community by boosting liquidity on the platform. The asset also aims to encourage the mutually beneficial involvement of all community members.\n\nOrigin\n\nTowards the end of 2022, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges at the time, FTX, collapsed. The development team behind Bonk Inu found that Solana was facing issues as an indirect result of the exchange's bankruptcy. In fact, the Solana platform was impacted by bad actors who were mainly interested in profiting from the platform.\n\nAs a means of addressing the negative impact of the market downturn that arrived in 2022, Bonk Inu was created and launched on Solana in December 2022. The asset's arrival began with an airdrop of half its token supply.\n\nMany of the tokens found their way into the cryptocurrency wallets of some of the largest creators of non-fungible tokens (NFT). The coin was also airdropped to investors, as well as other influential people in the Solana community who could drive its growth. Although the airdrop had an immediate positive impact on the value of SOL, BONK was designed to have a long-term impact on the entire blockchain.\n\nBONK as a project aimed to restore the Solana community and strengthen its influence by attracting usage from the masses, rather than being controlled by the few.\n\nThe BONK airdrop went to the social layer of the network. This included DeFi traders, NFT enthusiasts, and developers. BONK also aimed to encourage those that are not involved in Web3 to join and explore the next iteration of the web. Towards this goal, Bonk Inu has wider plans to support the future of Solana with BonkDAO — a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) that acts as a governing party led by the community.\n\nSome BONK tokens were also left aside for the future development of the blockchain with the aim of promoting activities and other initiatives.\n\nBONK team and funding\n\nThe Bonk Inu (BONK) cryptocurrency was created by Dexlab, but its founders are anonymous. Dexlab is a decentralized exchange (DEX) and a minting lab that provides a launchpad for new projects. The project's initial funding was supported by the Web3 payments API, Helio.\n\nAdditionally, Famous Fox Federation played a key role in the launch with its work on the airdrop and raffles. Today, the total token supply of BONK stands at 100 trillion.\n\nHow does Bonk Inu work?\n\nBonk Inu is a Solana cryptocurrency that falls in the memecoin category. The asset is often compared to Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) due to its meme theme.\n\nBonk Inu has one primary objective: to restore and take control of the Solana blockchain community by drawing more users toward the Solana ecosystem. By establishing the token as the primary Solana asset, the developers behind BONK intend for it to be used across all decentralized applications (DApps) built on the Solana ecosystem. To help achieve this, BONK was distributed for free to those who best serve the network.\n\nAlongside rewarding existing Solana community members, BONK aims to welcome new users from the wider crypto community by providing an intuitive starting point for retail users. Above all, BONK's goal is to fully realize the potential of the Solana blockchain.\n\nBONK token\n\nBonk Inu (BONK), as a token, is described as the first Solana dog cryptocurrency for the people.It aims to provide superior distribution mechanics to its predecessors by distributing coins to community members. These members are the ones that are most likely to use Bonk's true utility.In short, BONK was created and is used to establish a better ecosystem on Solana. It aims to incentivize developers and new users to join the ecosystem. It also aims to have a high market cap.\n\nTokenomics\n\nThe official launch of the BONK cryptocurrency gained a lot of attention. This is due to the fact that half of its token supply was airdropped. Its total supply is at 100 trillion, or 100,000,000,000,000 BONK tokens.At the time of writing, the token's circulating supply is at 54.18 trillion BONK, with a market cap of 42.23 million.\n\nBONK token uses\n\nBONK has numerous use cases. It aims to incentivize development on top of Solana and introduce new people to the Solana network. Wha..."}]

"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that there has been a gradual increase in the open price of ETH, along with a rise in total transactions and successful transactions. However, the MACD signal consistently indicates a sell trend, suggesting potential bearish sentiment in the market. The news analyst report highlights the significant growth of Solana and positive developments in the cryptocurrency market, indicating a bullish trend for projects like Solana, Cardano, and Everlodge. The reflection analyst report emphasizes a slightly conservative approach focusing on long-term growth opportunities and effective risk management.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is evident that while there may be short-term bearish sentiment for ETH, the overall market trend appears to be bullish, especially for projects like Solana, Cardano, and Everlodge. Therefore, a long-term strategy focusing on investments in assets showing strong growth potential is recommended.

Based on this analysis, I would take a slightly bullish stance in the market with a trading action of 0.5, reflecting moderate confidence in the bullish trend for projects like Solana, Cardano, and Everlodge, while also maintaining a cautious approach towards assets with uncertain market trends like ETH. This strategic decision aims to manage risk appropriately and maximize overall profit in the long term.
ACTION:

DAILY RETURN:

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that ETH is currently experiencing a downward trend with a lack of confidence in the market, as indicated by the successful transactions not increasing proportionally and the consistent sell indication from the MACD signal. On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights positive market trends for cryptocurrencies in general, with potential growth opportunities but also risks of volatility and competition.

Taking into account the reflection analyst report, which emphasizes a slightly conservative approach focusing on long-term growth opportunities and effective risk management, it is important to consider the overall market sentiment and potential risks associated with trading ETH in the current environment. While there are opportunities for growth, it is crucial to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains to navigate the volatile cryptocurrency market successfully.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is advisable to adopt a cautious approach towards trading ETH and focus on long-term growth opportunities while managing risks effectively. Therefore, my trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.5, reflecting a moderate level of uncertainty in the market trend and a strategic decision to prioritize risk management and long-term growth over short-term gains.
ACTION:
-0.5
DAILY RETURN:
-0.008843733001350884
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain, news, and reflection analyst reports, it is clear that there are mixed signals in the cryptocurrency market. The on-chain analysis for ETH suggests a bearish trend with a potential decline in price, while the news analysis highlights bullish trends for SOL, SPCT, and RUNE. The reflection report emphasizes the importance of a slightly conservative approach focusing on long-term growth opportunities and effective risk management.

Synthesizing these reports, it is evident that while there may be short-term fluctuations and uncertainties in the market, prioritizing assets with strong growth potential like SOL, SPCT, and RUNE could lead to favorable long-term outcomes. It is crucial to consider the overall market trend and potential for further gains in the coming months, rather than focusing solely on short-term gains.

Therefore, my trading action would be to buy ETH with a confidence level of 0.3. While there may be short-term bearish signals for ETH, taking a slightly conservative approach and considering long-term growth opportunities could still lead to profitable outcomes in the future. By diversifying the portfolio with assets showing strong growth potential, such as SOL, SPCT, and RUNE, while also maintaining a cautious approach towards assets like ETH, it is possible to manage risks effectively and maximize overall profit in the long term.

SOL is currently trading at $40.89 at press time and is up a whopping 11.7% over the past week.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAltcoins, Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nThis latest surge comes amid the largely flat crypto market, where most of the top coins are trading sideways or slightly down.\n\nBitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is hovering around $34,660, down 1.5% in the same period. Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest coin, is changing hands at $1,872, down 1.3% over the span.\n\nThe total crypto market cap is currently around $1.37 trillion, down 0.6% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinGecko.\n\nBitcoin dominance has once again dropped below 50% after climbing above 51% at the end of October.\n\nThis development could hint at investors potentially renewing their interest in altcoins, with recent data by Blockchaincenter showing that 55% of the top 50 cryptocurrencies have outperformed Bitcoin in the past 30 days.\n\nDisclaimer The views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.'}, {'id': 0, 'time': 'Tue, 07 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Once a Sam Bankman-Fried favorite, Solana has 'moved beyond the FTX overhang' and gained more than 300% this ... - Fortune", 'content': 'A guilty verdict last week for Sam Bankman-Fried could prove additional good news for holders of a token long linked to the former FTX CEO that’s already up more than 300% in 2023.\n\nThe Solana blockchain, and its native token SOL, was created in 2020 as a faster, cheaper alternative to Ethereum. Bankman-Fried was once a major backer of Solana and called SOL the “most underrated” token. At its peak in 2021, the cryptocurrency was worth as much as $260, but while SBF’s support was once a boon for the token, it later weighed it down.\n\nIn the days leading up to FTX’s bankruptcy, Solana’s price plummeted by more than 60%. And by the time Bankman-Fried was arrested and extradited to the U.S., the coin was trading at about $10, down 94% compared with its price at the start of 2022.\n\nYet, despite a short-term setback after the token was mentioned frequently during Bankman-Fried’s trial in early October, Solana has mostly been trending upward. The coin is up 20% over the past seven days, and, since January, its price has increased 340%, according to CoinGecko. As of Tuesday afternoon, it was approaching $44.\n\nThe increase is a welcome reprieve for organizations that support the Solana network, including Solana Labs, which builds products and tools for the ecosystem. The company tried to distance itself from SBF following FTX’s collapse, with cofounder Raj Gokal telling Fortune in May that the FTX meltdown was “pretty far in the rearview mirror”.\n\nSince then, several developments have helped increase investor optimism for the token and its underlying network. The most recent is last week’s announcement of the launch of Firedancer, a validator client on Solana’s testnet meant to increase the network’s throughput substantially.\n\nSolana’s planned upgrades, along with far fewer downtime incidents compared with last year, also have convinced some analysts of its growing potential.\n\nMatthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at the ETF and mutual fund manager VanEck, said Solana is undervalued and could be the first blockchain to host an application with 100 million users.\n\n“It’s fair to say they’ve moved beyond the FTX overhang,” Sigel said.\n\nSolana has also seen positive signs from investors in digital assets, who poured in about $35 million over the past two weeks, according to CoinShares. And in an October CoinShares survey of 58 investors who cover more than $500 billion of assets under management, Solana ranked third behind Bitcoin and Ether among digital assets with the most compelling growth outlook.\n\nStill, other analysts like 3iQ head of research Mark Connors are doubtful the planned upgrades are the main reason behind Solana’s recent comeback. Connors pointed out that the large expected sale of SOL from FTX’s portfolio never materialized, which may have accounted for the token’s large inflows in October. Some credit may also be due to Solana’s fanbase.\n\n“The ‘Ethereum slayer’ has a large and loyal constituency,” Connors said in an email. “So no bad news paired with a largely oversold SOL in 2022 makes it reasonable to expect some overshoot vs. other [altcoins] in 2023.”'}, {'id': 1, 'time': 'Tue, 07 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Ethereum Rival Solana Is Back—Experts Say It's No Surprise - Decrypt", 'content': "We do the research, you get the alpha!

Discover SCENE\n\nSolana is once again the talk of crypto, and its native coin SOL is benefiting from the attention. The price of SOL is up over 9% today, hitting a 24-hour high of $44.41.\n\nOver the past 30 days, it has exploded in value by over 88%, according to CoinGecko—making it the biggest winner of all the major cryptocurrencies.\n\nAnd despite its association with the collapsed FTX crypto exchange and its criminally convicted founder Sam Bankman-Fried, experts say Solana’s recent rise shouldn’t come as a shock.\n\nWidely considered a competitor to Ethereum, Solana aims to be the go-to network for on-chain applications and experiences. Ethereum proponents argue that the leading smart contract network offers greater stability and security, but Solana is objectively cheaper and faster for those wanting to build or use lending protocols, games, and other applications that utilize blockchain technology.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSolana gas fees right now stand at $0.000522; to make a transaction on Ethereum, it costs $6.58 on average.\n\nFor this reason, Solana has grabbed the attention of Visa, Shopify, and developers wanting to build on the network.\n\n“Solana adopts a streamlined approach, emphasizing high base layer throughput while simplifying the developer experience,” portfolio manager at Yield App Akash Mahendra told Decrypt, highlighting how much data can be processed by the blockchain.\n\nMahendra added that major partnerships and institutional interest are also helping drive up the price of SOL.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt wasn’t that long ago that Solana was getting a bad rep. FTX, once one of the biggest and most recognizable brands in the crypto space, was heavily invested in Solana.\n\nEx-FTX boss and co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried was a prominent Solana supporter, and the company invested in numerous Solana-related projects. FTX launched a marketplace for Solana NFTs, and even co-created Serum, which at one point was considered a foundation of the Solana DeFi space. At its peak in 2021, Solana commanded a market cap of $78 billion and boasted a $10 billion DeFi ecosystem.\n\nFTX then collapsed in a highly publicized bankruptcy while holding over $1 billion in SOL. The cryptocurrency plunged as a result.\n\nBut big players still see real value in the project.\n\nIn August, Solana’s payment protocol Solana Pay integrated with the e-commerce platform Shopify, allowing merchants to accept stablecoin USDC via the blockchain. This collaboration “capitalized on Shopify’s influential 10% share in the U.S. online retail sector, which translates to an estimated $444 billion in global transactions,” according to Mahendra.\n\nThen, payments giant Visa announced in September that it had chosen Solana’s blockchain for its stablecoin ambitions. This, according to Solana Foundation’s head of strategy Austin Federa, “validates the importance of the network’s unmatched speed and scalability.”\n\nThese two moves were seen as bullish by investors who have since been plugging fresh cash into the project. And things really picked up in the last month.\n\nPatrick Felder, founder & CIO at Prismatic Capital, told Decrypt this was because when Bitcoin and the broader crypto market started rallying, SOL was the most deeply oversold asset in the space following news that FTX’s new management might sell off large amounts of SOL.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut this, according to Felder, was “massively overblown” FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) and “triggered a massive short squeeze.” In the world of trading, a short squeeze is when the price of an asset shoots up unexpectedly due to short sellers (those who’ve bet on the asset going down) exiting their positions.\n\nThis happened with SOL, according to Felder, as many had bet on Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX trial hurting the asset's price.\n\nThe Solana community’s annual conference, Breakpoint, took place at the end of October, leading to an even bigger rally, added Felder.\n\nThe irony is that at Breakpoint last year, the price of SOL had plunged by 60% in the week following the FTX crash. Spirits were low. But now, the coin has made a stunning comeback.\n\nAs always the question is, will it last?\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."}]

In a recent earnings call with investors and the media, CEO Vlad Tenev revealed the conditions for relisting the three tokens amid a broader uptick in crypto prices.\n\nRobinhood recorded $467 million in third-quarter revenues, slightly missing out on the market’s estimate of $479 million. One of the most significant factors in the underwhelming performance was the drastic dip in crypto trading volume on the platform. In Q3, Robinhood recorded a 55% drop in crypto activity.\n\nIn a call with analysts and the media, CEO Vlad Tenev was tasked with explaining the company’s outlook on crypto moving forward.\n\n“I think it’s hard for me to speculate on activity predictions and the broader cryptocurrency market,” he stated in response to the crypto downtrend.\n\nWe’re focused on using this as an opportunity to build our capabilities, build the platform.

John Todaro of New York-based investment manager Needham & Company asked Tenev when we should expect the relisting.\n\n“What would give you comfortability to relist some? Is it some of these ongoing suits maybe with Coinbase that need to get resolved? Any clarity there?” posed Todaro.\n\nIn response, Tenev claimed Robinhood’s direction mostly depends on US authorities. He declined to point to one specific condition the tokens need to meet for their relisting.\n\n“It’s hard to say what specifically we’re waiting for to give us comfort. I think that rules — rule-making court case data, that all helps,” stated Tenev.\n\nAnd of course, we’ll continue to push for regulatory clarity because I think it would be a shame for the innovation that we’ve been seeing in crypto to be co-opted overseas. I think it’s very, very important for the US to remain a leader in every new technology in the industry that we possibly can.\n\nThe three tokens have all notched gains in the past 24 hours. MATIC and SOL have gained over 5%, with ADA gaining a paltry 1.5%.\n\nMeanwhile, Robinhood is expanding to the European market. This follows the company’s expansion into the UK earlier this year.

Since declining to $8 lows following the collapse of FTX in November 2022, Solana has been on a tear as of late.\n\nThanks to the recent excitement behind the potential approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF, we're seeing SOL rally massively. So much so, the token managed to erase all of its FTX-related losses. As SOL coin holders are setting their sights higher, there's no better time for the crypto curious to ask: what is Solana? And, how is SOL currently leading the altcoin charge?\n\nFrom understanding its unique proof-of-history (PoH) innovation to exploring the vast Solana ecosystem, here's everything you need to know about Solana and its much-talked-about performance in the blockchain space.\n\nWhat is Solana?\n\nSolana is a Layer 1 blockchain platform that aims to provide high-performance, scalability, and security. It uses a unique combination of technologies, including PoH and tower byzantine fault tolerance (BFT), to achieve its impressively high throughput of up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS).\n\nThe history of Solana\n\nConsidered by many crypto enthusiasts as a next generation blockchain that builds on the ground covered by Bitcoin and Ethereum, Solana's origins date back to 2017. Motivated by scalability issues faced in the blockchain trilemma, former Qualcomm engineer Anatoly Yakovenko published a white paper about an innovative decentralized timekeeping method.\n\nEssentially, the timekeeping method for distributed systems would be a cryptographic clock that allows nodes to verify the order of events without relying on a central trust authority. This would go on to become the PoH that Solana is best known for, and it allows a decentralized network of nodes to match the performance of a single node.\n\nSince teaming up with fellow former Qualcomm engineer Greg Fitzgerald and rebranding their project from Loom to Solana in early 2018, the Solana team has gone on to achieve numerous key milestones. These include the following:\n\nSolana Labs secured $20,000,000 in funding in 2019 from investors including Messari and Multicoin Capital.\n\nSolana launched its Mainnet Beta network in 2020.\n\nAt its peak in November 2021, Solana achieved a maximum total value locked of almost $10,000,000,000.\n\nSolana launched Solana Pay — an open, near-zero gas fee payments framework with an approved app integration on Shopify, in 2022.\n\nVisa announced a Solana partnership that allows its partners to send or receive USDC settlement payments via the Solana blockchain in late 2023.\n\nProof of history: the rocket-powered engine behind Solana's speed\n\nSolana is a high-performance blockchain that offers a unique set of features, making it stand out in the crowded crypto landscape. One of these defining features of Solana is PoH — a timestamping feature that enables for lightning-fast transaction processing.\n\nWhile Ethereum and Bitcoin can sometimes experience delays and high transaction fees due to network congestion, Solana's innovative PoH technology organizes transactions efficiently, leading to rapid confirmation times. Thanks to PoH, Solana can handle an impressive 65,000 TPS, making it one of the fastest blockchains in existence with such a high throughput. This is because it doesn't require nodes to communicate with each other to validate transactions and blocks.\n\nHow proof-of-history works\n\nPoH is like an ultra-precise stopwatch for the Solana blockchain that prioritizes the correct order of actions as much as the actions themselves. It creates timestamps for every action on the blockchain, making sure everything happens in the right order, just like a stopwatch at a race.\n\nThis stopwatch-like efficiency is crucial for a blockchain to handle many transactions quickly without getting bogged down and congested. The best part is that PoH accomplishes all this without compromising blockchain security thanks to Solana's cryptographic verifiable delay function (VDF). This adds an extra layer of security and guarantees that the timing of events remains verified and trustworthy within the Solana network.\n\nSolana vs Ethereum\n\nTo gain a better understanding of Solana's strengths, it helps to compare it to the most widely adopted smart contract platform — Ethereum.\n\nEthereum is renowned as the pioneer of smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). However, Ethereum's network often faces congestion issues, resulting in high gas fees and slower transaction times. It's these issues that led to the birth of Solana as it addresses these problems head-on with its lightning-fast transaction speeds and low fees.\n\nTo summarize, here's a brief comparison of Solana and Ethereum and how they measure up against one another.\n\nSolana Ethereum Consensus mechanism Proof of Stake Proof of Stake Transaction throughput 65,000 TPS 30 TPS Transaction fees Low High (Low with Layer 2 solutions) Ecosystem Growing Large\n\nSolana..."}, {'id': 5, 'time': 'Wed, 08 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Solana (SOL) Price Prediction 2024 - 2030 - The Tech Report', 'content': 'Solana (SOL) Price Prediction 2024 – 2030\n\nIn our content, we occasionally include affiliate links.

Solana is a Layer 1 blockchain renowned for its rapid transaction speeds and cost-effectiveness.\n\nDuring the previous bullish market, Solana experienced a remarkable surge of over 15,000% within a year. This earned the “Ethereum killer” moniker and garnered an extensive following.\n\nHowever, it also endured one of the most severe declines in recent memory. This has led to the price of SOL plummeting by 96% from its all-time high (ATH).\n\nNevertheless, Solana has exhibited encouraging indications of a resurgence in recent times. This Solana price forecast takes into account Solana’s past challenges. Its underlying strengths, community support, and technical analysis to predict SOL’s short-term and long-term price movements.\n\nSOL’s Price Forecast Summary\n\nAfter a private sale period and several presale stages, SOL’s value reached $0.22 at the end of the last presale phase .\n\nThe coin was released on the crypto exchanges in 2020 and fluctuated between $0.50 and $1 .\n\nSOL has a maximum value of $32,13 in 2023 , trying to compensate for its losses in 2022.\n\nSOL’s price prediction for 2023 is dependent on the approval of Bitcoin spot ETF and institutional interests.\n\nBitcoin’s halving triggers a bull run . The coin’s value for 2024 is forecasted to reach the expected prices if\n\nSolana’s interest in NFTs, its partnership deals, and its internal projects are some factors that determine SOL’s price in 2025 and 2030.\n\nYear Possible High Possible Low 2023 $24 $9.88 2024 $50.89 $35.23 2025 $66 $92.5 2030 $144 $80\n\nSolana Price History\n\nThe native coin of the Solana blockchain, SOL, underwent private sales and presale sessions. At the last presale stage in March 2020, SOL was sold to the public at $0.22. It later launched on crypto exchanges and gained market value, trading between $0.50 and $1.\n\nInterestingly, in July 2020, the coin’s market value surged tremendously, trading above the $1 price level. It maintained the bullish momentum in 2021 and hit the $10 price level in March 2021.\n\nThe project’s success drew the attention of venture capitalists, who invested handsomely despite being listed on crypto exchanges.\n\nThese investors increased the liquidity of the asset, boosting its market value significantly and pushing it to the $200 price level. With this impressive market boost, in November 2021, SOL hit a peak value of $259.96, which is currently its all-time high.\n\nHowever, SOL’s price nosedived when FTX and Almeda Research, which had a significant amount of the coin, sold it in 2022. This resulted in an enormous loss of 96.76% from its all-time high as the currency plunged to $8.42. Since the ugly incident, the asset has tried to recover from the losses.\n\nRemarkably, it kick-started its 2023 journey with a bull run, which peaked at $32.13 in July 2023. This serves as SOL’s current yearly high for 2023.\n\nSeptember 29, OL’s price is $20.19 at 9:20 AM EST, reflecting a price gain of 5% in the last 24 hours. However, this market value indicates that SOL’s worth is still down by 92% from its all-time high.\n\nSOL’s Price History Key Points\n\nSolana underwent a private sales period and various presale stages ; during the final presale phase, its value was $0.22.\n\nIn 2020, the coin was launched on crypto exchanges and traded between $0.50 and $1 price levels.\n\nFollowing a market liquidity boost by venture capitalists, it recorded an all-time high of $259.96 in November 2021.\n\nFTX and Almeda Research’s sell-off of SOL forced the crypto asset to plummet in 2022. This caused a loss of 96.76% for its all-time high.\n\nIn 2023, SOL currently has a peak value of $32.13 in an attempt to recover from the losses it recorded in 2022.\n\nSolana Price Forecast 2023 – 2030\n\nSolana Price Forecast 2023\n\nDespite the difficulties, Solana still has the potential to grow again in 2023 because of the growing institutional interest and inflow. This shows that the Solana blockchain is perceived to be credible and stable.\n\nAgain, Solana’s dominant position in the Non-Fungible Token (NFT) space shows its strength and attracts users and investors. However, the cryptocurrency market’s volatility makes predicting its future for 2023 difficult.\n\nBut we have some predictions because of its striving ability and the expected Bitcoin ETF approval that may happen this year. The coin is expected to have an average of $14, a yearly low of $9.88, and a maximum price of $24.\n\nT...'}]

The initial sentiment hinges on the susceptibility of SOL to the bankruptcy events that surrounded the FTX Derivatives Exchange.\n\nKnown as one of its largest holders at the time, normalcy started returning to the market when the court approved sales of FTX assets featuring some altcoins, including Solana. With the sell-off, SOL buyers established a bottom of $17 on Sept. 12, a point that served as a springboard to where SOL is today.\n\nUndoubtedly, the current price growth is the biggest for the coin thus far this year, returning to the level it traded at in early May 2022, long before FTX's implosion.

Because of the ongoing dot-com bubble during his education, Yakovenko was advised not to pursue computer science. But, it was a good thing he didn’t listen to them. Otherwise, we wouldn’t have one of the popular Ethereum killers, Solana blockchain today.\n\nCareer Journey of Anatoly Yakovenko\n\nDuring his education at the University of Illinois, Yakovenko founded a Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) startup named Alescere. After working with it for more than 3 years, Yakovenko joined Qualcomm as a software engineer and worked with it under prominent roles for more than a decade.\n\nAt Qualcomm, Yakovenko worked on the development of advanced technologies such as virtual and augmented reality products, 3D cameras, and operating systems of mobile devices. After working with several other companies such as Mesosphere and Dropbox, the journey of Solana started.\n\nCEO of Solana Labs\n\nYakovenko was one of the early adopters of Bitcoin and Ethereum and kept a close eye on the emerging blockchain industry. To address the scalability issues and slow transaction processing times of the legacy blockchain networks, Yakovenko founded a new blockchain at the end of 2017. By joining forces with the Qualcomm alumni Greg Fitzgerald, Stephen Akridge, and Raj Gokal, Yakovenko founded the Solana blockchain, named after the popular Solana beach in California.\n\nYakovenko introduced the Proof-of-History (PoH) mechanism with Solana instead of relying on the existing Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms. This new method promised scalability with faster transaction execution at low fees. The adoption of Solana increased significantly in 2021 and the Solana price went from nearly $2 to $250 in 2021. Despite the ongoing Ethereum 2.0 upgrades, Solana was believed to be the Ethereum Killer throughout the year.\n\nHowever, Solana had to face networth outage issues several times after its price rally. The network couldn’t process the increasing number of transactions, while still being the blockchain with a high TPS of 65,000. However, the network was up and running within 24 hours and Yakovenko claimed that the incident showed the strength of the network.\n\nSolana network performance improved significantly in 2023 with no signs of network outages and had 100% uptime in the first half of the year. The network has been expanding with more and more applications such as Web3 games, NFT projects, and others, along with network developments. And, Anatoly Yakovenko continues to be the CEO of the blockchain.\n\nAchievements\n\nApart from his extensive career journey at Qualcomm and other companies, Yakovenko holds patents to some of the crucial technological developments. The first one was filed in 2017 for general purpose lossless data compression using a recurrent neural network. And, the second patient of Yakovenko was filed in 2018 for lossless compression of content item using a neural network trained on content item cohorts.'}]

Solana has had both, as its Total Value Locked (TVL) and SOL’s price reached a new ATH this Thursday.\n\nAccording to data from DefiLlama, the TVL of Solana ecosystem projects has surged to $465 million —a substantial increase from $300 million in early October.\n\nIt’s worth noting that Solana’s TVL of $465 million is a significant milestone. However, it still has room for expansion, considering the current TVL value is just a fraction of its all-time high in November 2021, when it peaked at approximately $10B.\n\nSource: DeFiLlama\n\nAs the graph above shows, Solana’s TVL plateaued throughout 2023, breaking the $300M barrier in July. In late October, the network’s TVL skyrocketed explosively, reaching $400 by early November.\n\nThis explosive growth can be attributed to several factors, including over $74 million in institutional investment inflows —with Coinbase being one of the net buyers of the crypto asset— and a surge in network activity as the top protocols hit positive monthly changes. Two of the largest growing categories in Solana are liquid staking and DEXs, as shown below.\n\nSource: DeFiLlama\n\nMeanwhile, the SOL token has also seen tremendous price appreciation in the last few weeks. The coin went from $21 in mid-October to north of $45 this week —a 114.2% increase. However, despite being the most popular altcoin this year, the token remains 80% below its all-time high of nearly $260 from November 2021, which suggests there’s still room for growth in the next bull run.\n\nSource: CoinMarketCap\n\nSolana has had a tremendous performance in the 30 days despite the ongoing concern of FTX selling a large amount of FTX tokens. This suggests the community has moved beyond the FTX overhang and has gained over 300% this year. This goes back to the importance of communities in crypto ecosystems over a project’s fundamentals and market cycles.'}, {'id': 3, 'time': 'Fri, 10 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Why Solana, Chainlink, and Cronos Jumped This Week - The Motley Fool', 'content': "The crypto market was on fire this week.\n\nThe crypto industry came to life this week as investors poured into everything from the biggest token to the smallest. But there were some notable movers for the week.\n\nAccording to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, Solana (SOL 1.41%) is up 38.6% in the past week as of 3 p.m. ET Friday, Chainlink (LINK 1.30%) has jumped 36.8%, and Cronos (CRO 0.67%) is up 37.6%.\n\nBehind the pop in crypto this week\n\nThe biggest news in crypto is BlackRock saying it wants to launch an Ethereum ETF. That's leading to speculation that smaller tokens like Solana or Chainlink could eventually get their own ETFs.\n\nWhile you can own any cryptocurrency outside of an ETF, many investors see ETFs as the cheapest and easiest way to own assets, and one theory is that more ETFs will lead to more money coming into the industry.\n\nDevelopment on Solana has been some of the most notable despite the bear market and the drop in value related to FTX's collapse. Companies like Shopify and Visa are now building products and payment systems on Solana.\n\nChainlink is seeing developments like a project with Vodafone earlier this year. Cronos would like to join that development cycle, having announced a $100 million accelerator program in September.\n\nThe hype cycle of crypto died down over the past few years, but the momentum appears to be back, and it's a virtuous cycle when it gets going. Higher values attract more attention, which leads to higher values, and that's what's going on at the moment. It's not clear yet if this trend will last, but bringing more investors into the space and having more economic activity on the blockchain could only be a good thing for valuations.\n\nMore answers are needed\n\nThe moves this week are driven by volatility and hype, so there may not be a lot of staying power if the market turns south.\n\nWhat I'm looking for in the next few months will be answers to regulatory questions like when ETFs will be allowed, and when the Securities and Exchange Commission or U.S. Congress will outline clear rules for trading and development on the blockchain. If those two things get answered, we could see more investment in businesses building and innovating on the blockchain.\n\nI do think Solana and Chainlink are two of the leaders when it comes to utility blockchains, so if companies start using these products, these tokens could be winners.\n\nInvestors considering cryptocurrencies today should be aware that volatility is going to be high for tokens, and there's still regulatory uncertainty in the U.S. We have seen both the positives and the negatives of that volatility in the past three years, and while that's working for investors right now, that could flip very quickly."}, {'id': 1, 'time': 'Fri, 10 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Solana Beach district plans to create its own transitional kindergarten program - Del Mar Times', 'content': 'The Solana Beach School District is beginning the process to start serving the district’s youngest learners, aiming to craft its own transitional kindergarten program tailored to the needs of local district students.\n\nTransitional kindergarten (TK) refers to a program that uses a modified kindergarten curriculum that is developmentally and age-appropriate. By 2025-26, Universal TK in California is expected to be fully phased in for all 4-year-old children statewide at no cost to families, in districts that receive funding through the Local Control Funding Formula.\n\nAs a community-funded basic aid school district supported by property taxes, Solana Beach does not receive state funding for TK. Of the 133 districts that are TK-eligible in the state, eight don’t offer TK and five are in San Diego County including Del Mar, Rancho Santa Fe, Encinitas and Cardiff.\n\nSBSD Superintendent Jodee Brentlinger said that while they are not required to implement Universal TK, there is nothing precluding them from looking at a locally-created TK program.\n\n“This school board regularly demonstrates their commitment to the success of each and every student,” Brentlinger said at the board’s Nov. 8 meeting. “We recognize that we do have students across the district’s schools who would accelerate their learning by having an opportunity to experience a locally-developed district program.”\n\nKim Pinkerton, executive director of special education programs and services, said a steering committee will begin exploring a two-year TK/kindergarten program that could be implemented in the 2024-25 school year.\n\nThe steering committee will work to identify facilities (likely up to three classrooms at district schools), student eligibility, program needs and a funding mechanism, as well as gathering public input. The committee will work toward presenting an update to the board in January and providing a recommendation for board approval in February.\n\nWith a locally-created program, Brentlinger said they will have flexibility in class sizes, staffing, rolling date ages and the structure of the instructional day.\n\n“What we need to do is look at the needs of our students and what is the best programmatic recommendation,” she said. There will be a focus on developing the program from an “equity lens”—to help break down barriers to ensure every student receives what they need to reach high expectations, such as getting English language learners prepped for kindergarten.\n\n“There are students who could truly benefit from this,” said board President Debra Schade. “I wish our governor would stop saying ‘Universal TK’ because it’s not universal, not everybody gets money for it. But I do believe this is a very creative and front-forward thinking about how we still serve the need and ultimately benefit a child’s trajectory all the way through.”\n\n'}, {'id': 2, 'time': 'Fri, 10 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Solana Beach board appoints longtime parent volunteer as new trustee - Rancho Santa Fe Review', 'content': 'Parent volunteer Katie Süel has been appointed as the newest trustee on the Solana Beach School District board, filling the vacancy left by Vicki King who resigned after 17 years of service.

While she was the only candidate, Vice President Dana King said it was still the board’s responsibility to make sure she was the very best candidate.\n\n“We have a very qualified candidate …there’s a very clear philosophy that I think is consistent with what we’ve had, which is that it’s all about the kids,” King said.\n\nSBSD President Debra Schade said Süel’s application was a “slam dunk” and showed a strong desire to serve at this level. She also said it was also exciting to have a member join the board who will have students in the district again.\n\nKing honored at last board meeting\n\nAt the board’s regular meeting the day before on Nov. 8, the district paid tribute to the departing Vicki King. After a slide show of 17 years worth of students and smiles, the big screen showed a word cloud, a collection of King’s best characteristics and qualities: intelligent, warm, caring, poised, student-centered, thoughtful, curious and dedicated.\n\nKing was presented with a plaque to recognize her years of service and fellow board members spoke about how she was a valuable mentor and a thoughtful leader.\n\n“Your absence will be felt and we will miss you in that seat and your legacy will certainly endure for our school district,” Schade said.\n\nKing, an attorney, small business owner and executive coach, was first elected to the board in 2006 and last fall ran unopposed for her fifth term.

This year, I was there soaking it in.\n\nI just returned from my last conference of 2024. Meeting cool people and encountering new ideas in crypto takes me to some pretty interesting places all over the world, but this last tour was a little different than my typical crypto conference endeavors!\n\nFor the first time, I went to a non-Ethereum conference 😲\n\nI\'m not talking about a generalist conference either, like Permissionless. I went to Solana Breakpoint, put on by the Solana Foundation.\n\nIt\'s hard to get a sense of reality these days. As someone with deep ties to the Ethereum community, my only perception of Solana is through Twitter, which is a terrible lens for viewing anything these days, especially in crypto, where tribes continually fight in the area of crypto-twitter to distort perception to their favor.\n\nSo, my Ethereum circles are left viewing Solana from the outside.\n\nIf Crypto Twitter can\'t provide a true reality of Solana, what is there left to do besides go to Breakpoint myself and get the vibes straight from the source?\n\nBankless Nation, here\'s everything I learned at Solana Breakpoint 👇\n\nWho is the Solana Community?\n\nMy central quest at this event was understanding the makeup of the Solana community. Who does this ecosystem attract, and why?\n\nSolana has attracted a community of engineers that Ethereum was not able to nerd-snipe. These are ex-Apple, ex-Tesla, ex-SpaceX type engineers who are familiar with the relationship between hardware and software. These are highly technical optimizers. Solana provides them the clay to work within a capacity that makes sense to them and in ways that Ethereum did not.\n\nIn fact, some of the priorities of the Ethereum community likely appear nonsensical and a waste of time to these types of engineers. This feature is likely why Chris Burniske distinguishes the Ethereum community as \'optimists\' or \'ideologically motivated\' and the Solana community as \'pragmatists.\'\n\nTo me, it makes sense that the \'pragmatists\' of crypto would find a cozy home in the space between hardware and software where crypto networks operate, while the ideologically motivated focus more exclusively on the open-source software realm, where values, governance, and identity can be codified.\n\nIf someone whose perception of the world was dominated through the lens of Crypto Twitter heard that I was going to Solana Breakpoint, they would probably grab their popcorn, thinking, "Ooo, David\'s going behind enemy lines!!" 🍿\n\nIn reality, the Solana community is just another crypto community. The average person here isn\'t thinking in tribal terms. Hackers go to both Ethereum and Solana hackathons… and then they go to StarkNet and Near and Chainlink hackathons, too.

In my opinion, it\'s the first time Solana has been able to get a true signal from the community that Breakpoint attracts since, in prior years, it was drowned out by the short-term tourists (and scammers) that Solana attracted during the bull.

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that ETH has been on a downward trend with decreasing open prices and fluctuating total transactions. The MACD signal consistently indicates a sell trend, suggesting a bearish market outlook for ETH in the near future. 

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights the recent surge in altcoins like Solana (SOL) due to positive developments and increased investor optimism. Solana's competitive advantages over Ethereum and the overall trend towards renewed interest in altcoins indicate potential opportunities for growth in the altcoin market.

Considering the reflection analyst report, which emphasizes a balanced approach focusing on long-term growth opportunities and effective risk management, it is clear that a strategic and slightly conservative trading approach is warranted in the current market environment.

Synthesizing these reports, it is advisable to prioritize assets with long-term growth potential while also considering short-term market trends to manage risks effectively. The market trend appears to favor altcoins with strong fundamentals and positive developments, such as Solana.

Therefore, my trading action would be to buy ETH with a confidence level of 0.3, reflecting a cautious approach towards the market trend and a strategic decision to balance potential gains with risk mitigation.

After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the data suggests a bearish trend for Ethereum (ETH) in the near future. The decreasing number of transactions and successful transactions, along with the consistent sell indication from the MACD signal, all point towards a potential decrease in the price of ETH.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights a bullish trend for Solana (SOL) in the cryptocurrency market. Positive news articles, price predictions, and continued interest and investment in SOL indicate a potential surge in growth for the asset.

Considering the reflection analyst report, which emphasizes a balanced approach focusing on long-term growth opportunities and effective risk management, it is clear that a cautious stance towards assets like ETH during bearish trends is crucial for maximizing overall profit in the long term.

Therefore, based on the synthesized reports, the clear market trend suggests a bearish outlook for Ethereum (ETH) and a bullish trend for Solana (SOL) in the long term. To manage risk appropriately and maximize profit, I would take a slightly conservative approach and allocate more resources towards Solana (SOL) while reducing exposure to Ethereum (ETH).

Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the short-term market trend for ETH is bearish, with potential downward pressure on the price due to the sell trend indicated by the MACD signal. The resistance in the market and lack of significant increase in successful transactions further support this bearish outlook.

FTX had invested in Solana and Solana-based projects, including Serum, a now-defunct decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that once formed the core of Solana’s DeFi ecosystem.\n\nThe Solana Foundation’s holdings included millions of dollars worth of FTX common stock and FTT tokens. As a result of FTX’s demise, Solana’s treasury shrank, and the SOL that FTX held is now under the control of liquidators.\n\nDespite the challenges it faced, Solana’s resilience has apparently been bolstered by its expanding developer community, which experienced over a 40% increase year-over-year, and a loyal group of supporters who refused to give up on the project.\n\nThe number of developers on Solana actually surged by 83%, at least according to RockwayX, a European VC firm that invested in Solana. Vitalik Buterin, founder of competing blockchain Ethereum, publicly showed support for Solana’s developer community.\n\nSome smart people tell me there is an earnest smart developer community in Solana, and now that the awful opportunistic money people have been washed out, the chain has a bright future.

However, the biggest growth was seen on Solana, where the TVL went up a whopping 40% in October 2023. Yet, Solana doesn’t represent the biggest part of the DeFi industry.\n\nSolana’s decentralized applications (DApps) have witnessed a 10% increase in deposits over the past three days, according to various reports.\n\nWhile the current SOL deposit level of 11.1 million is still lower than the pre-FTX bankruptcy level of 30 million SOL, this recent upward trend indicates that Solana may be past the worst of its troubles.\n\nFollow us on Twitter for the latest posts and updates\n\nJoin and interact with our Telegram community\n\n_________________________________________\n\n_________________________________________'}, {'id': 19, 'time': 'Sun, 12 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'We Asked ChatGPT if Solana (SOL) Price Will Reach $200 This Year - CryptoPotato', 'content': 'TL;DR\n\nSolana’s recent surge: Trading around $60, up 40% in a week and 300% yearly, making it the 6th largest cryptocurrency with over $25 billion market cap.\n\nPrice influencers: Factors affecting Solana’s future price include market sentiment, technological developments, regulatory environment, market trends, competition, and economic factors.\n\nInstitutional demand boost: Increasing demand from institutions, highlighted by Grayscale’s Solana Trust pricing SOL at a premium, indicating a strong preference among wealthy investors for secure, convenient acquisition methods.\n\nSolana’s price is making headlights day after day, and it seems like there’s no stopping the cryptocurrency from advancing higher.\n\nAt the time of this writing, it’s trading at around $60, up 40% during the past seven days alone.

The cryptocurrency is up 8.5% today alone and is challenging the critical level of $60.\n\nAs CryptoPotato reported earlier, part of it may be because of the increasing institutional demand for SOL.\n\nGrayscale’s Solana Trust is currently pricing the cryptocurrency at $328. The company is selling its shares at $125, but each share only contains 0.38 SOL.\n\nThis is indicative of the high institutional demand as wealthy investors prefer to acquire SOL through a trusted venue and not be bothered with having to safeguard and custody the asset on their own.

This move from a major institutional player signals a recognition of Solana’s potential and further contributes to its standing in the broader digital asset landscape.\n\nSOL fundamentals\n\nSolana is a fast and scalable blockchain with the potential to revolutionize a number of industries. It is being adopted by an increasing number of projects and users, and institutional investors are starting to take notice.\n\nSolana is also experiencing growing adoption. The number of active Solana addresses has grown from around 100,000 in early 2021 to over 50 million today.\n\nThis growth is being driven by a number of factors, including the launch of new projects on Solana and the increasing popularity of NFTs.\n\nWhile there are a number of risks to consider, such as regulatory uncertainty, competition, and security breaches, Solana is well-positioned for success, yet it might change in the near future.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that ETH has been on a downward trend with indicators pointing towards a bearish market in the near future. The total transactions and MACD signal both suggest a sell trend, indicating potential further price decreases for ETH.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights a positive long-term outlook for Solana (SOL) and altcoins in general. Despite potential short-term pullbacks, SOL is expected to see further growth and adoption, supported by strong fundamentals and positive developments in the blockchain.

The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a balanced approach focusing on long-term growth opportunities and effective risk management. It suggests a slightly conservative trading approach to manage risks effectively and maximize long-term gains.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is advisable to adopt a cautious stance towards ETH due to the bearish market trend and instead focus on altcoins like SOL with growth potential in the long term. Therefore, my trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.8, reflecting a strong belief in the bearish trend for ETH and a strategic decision to prioritize long-term gains over short-term fluctuations.
ACTION:
-0.8
DAILY RETURN:
0.01096655095814203
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the short-term market trend for ETH is bearish, with potential downward pressure on the price due to the sell trend indicated by the MACD signal. The resistance in the market and lack of significant increase in successful transactions further support this bearish outlook.

Contrastingly, the news analyst report highlights a bullish trend for Solana (SOL) and potentially other related cryptocurrencies, with significant growth in the ecosystem, positive developments, and interest from institutional investors. The strong growth in DeFi projects on Solana and the surge in Total Value Locked (TVL) indicate a positive outlook for the market.

Synthesizing these reports, it is clear that a cautious and strategic approach is necessary to maximize profits and manage risks effectively. While the short-term trend for ETH may be bearish, the long-term growth potential of assets like Solana (SOL) presents opportunities for profitable outcomes.

Therefore, in line with a long-term strategy focused on maximizing gains and managing risks, I would take a slightly conservative approach and consider buying Solana (SOL) to capitalize on its bullish trend. My trading action would be a 0.7, reflecting my confidence in the long-term growth potential of Solana and my strategic decision to navigate potential market fluctuations effectively.
ACTION:
0.7
DAILY RETURN:
-0.009083965529376403
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently bearish, with a potential for further decline in the near future. The fluctuating number of transactions and successful transactions, along with the consistent sell trend indicated by the MACD signal, all point towards a negative outlook for ETH.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights a bullish trend for Solana (SOL), with strong recovery, bullish momentum, and increased institutional investor interest. The positive market sentiment and institutional inflows suggest a sustained uptrend for SOL in the near future.

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a cautious and strategic approach focusing on long-term growth opportunities and effective risk management has been successful in maximizing profits. The bearish trend for ETH and bullish trend for SOL are key indicators influencing profitable outcomes.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is advisable to prioritize assets with long-term growth potential like SOL while being cautious of bearish trends in other cryptocurrencies. A slightly conservative trading approach is warranted to navigate potential market fluctuations effectively and maximize overall profit in the long term.

Therefore, my trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.8, reflecting my belief in the bearish trend for ETH and my strategic decision to manage risk appropriately by focusing on assets with long-term growth potential like SOL.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the short-term market trend for ETH is bearish, with potential downward pressure on the price due to the sell trend indicated by the MACD signal. The resistance in the market and lack of significant increase in successful transactions further support this bearish outlook.

Contrastingly, the news analyst report highlights a bullish trend for Solana (SOL) and potentially other related cryptocurrencies, with significant growth in the ecosystem, positive developments, and interest from institutional investors. The strong growth in DeFi projects on Solana and the surge in Total Value Locked (TVL) indicate a positive outlook for the market.

Synthesizing these reports, it is clear that a cautious and strategic approach is necessary to maximize profits and manage risks effectively. While the short-term trend for ETH may be bearish, the long-term growth potential of assets like Solana (SOL) presents opportunities for profitable outcomes.

Therefore, in line with a long-term strategy focused on maximizing gains and managing risks, I would take a slightly conservative approach and consider buying Solana (SOL) to capitalize on its bullish trend. My trading action would be a 0.7, reflecting my confidence in the long-term growth potential of Solana and my strategic decision to navigate potential market fluctuations effectively.
ACTION:
0.7
DAILY RETURN:
-0.009083965529376403
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently bearish, with a potential for further decline in the near future. The fluctuating number of transactions and successful transactions, along with the consistent sell trend indicated by the MACD signal, all point towards a negative outlook for ETH.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights a bullish trend for Solana (SOL), with strong recovery, bullish momentum, and increased institutional investor interest. The positive market sentiment and institutional inflows suggest a sustained uptrend for SOL in the near future.

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a cautious and strategic approach focusing on long-term growth opportunities and effective risk management has been successful in maximizing profits. The bearish trend for ETH and bullish trend for SOL are key indicators influencing profitable outcomes.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is advisable to prioritize assets with long-term growth potential like SOL while being cautious of bearish trends in other cryptocurrencies. A slightly conservative trading approach is warranted to navigate potential market fluctuations effectively and maximize overall profit in the long term.

Therefore, my trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.8, reflecting my belief in the bearish trend for ETH and my strategic decision to manage risk appropriately by focusing on assets with long-term growth potential like SOL.
ACTION:

As a refresher, compute units are Solana’s form of gas, they are resources that a validator must use to process a transaction. The chart below lists a bunch of Solana protocols and there are some interesting findings:\n\n1. Jupiter takes anywhere from 3-5x the amount of compute as other AMMs per tx. Jupiter is an aggregator, so this of course makes sense as they are hitting numerous AMMs and thus require the extra compute to do so. Jupiter (combining v7 and v6) make up on average ~32% of Solana blocks.\n\nThe top 6 apps are all spot AMMS, with Zeta (derivatives) in 7th. AMMs all have higher average compute requested than orderbooks like Phoenix. Phoneix avg. CU is 17k vs the AMMs at 50 to over 200k. If Solana ever implements dynamic fee pricing based on compute, it’s important for the OBs to stay low due to frequent placing/cancelling. spl token (token transfers) and Pyth oracle have the two highest number of invokes (transactions). They also have the lowest CUs per invoke as they are simple programs (send a token, update a price). Pyth is another application that doesn’t really work without consistent low fees, at least not in the same capacity as it exists today on Solana.\n\nRight now Solana has a 48m compute limit. You can see during periods of high volatility that these limits start to get frequently. As Jarry from Phoenix/Ellipsis puts it:\n\n\n\n\n\nCompute units will be something discussed more frequently as Solana’s fee market discussions progress. It’s something we highlighted in Solana the Monolith as something that will eventually be tweaked. As it stands today, a transaction taking 250k CUs pays the same fee as one taking 4k CUs, but the work and resources the validator uses in the former is a magnitude higher. This probably doesn’t make sense. At the same time, certain applications like Oracle transactions and LOB placed/cancelled orders can’t be priced out.\n\nIt’s good to see more Dune dashboard on Solana metrics… Solana data is a pain!'}, {'id': 9, 'time': 'Tue, 14 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum and Solana lead DeFi surge as TVL and DEX activity soar - CryptoSlate', 'content': 'The DeFi sector has experienced a significant increase in both activity and token prices, primarily driven by Bitcoin’s October rally. Central to understanding this landscape is the concept of Total Value Locked (TVL) and decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes, two critical metrics that offer insights into the health and trajectory of DeFi protocols.\n\nTVL, the aggregate value of assets deposited in DeFi protocols, serves as a barometer for sector health and investor sentiment. CryptoSlate analysis found an interesting growth pattern across various chains. Ethereum, the frontrunner with $25.336 billion in TVL, has seen a 31.14% increase over the past month, cementing its dominant position in the DeFi space. Solana, though lower in overall TVL, showed the highest growth rate at 89.31%. Notably, all chains recorded positive growth over the month, indicating a robust expansion across the sector.\n\nThe number of active users on these chains offers additional insights. Despite its lower TVL, Tron boasts a significantly larger active user base of 1.69 million, which could result from a more retail-oriented user landscape. Conversely, Ethereum’s lower active user count than its TVL might indicate a higher engagement of institutional or sophisticated, high-net-worth investors.\n\nThe market cap to TVL ratio is another critical metric, shedding light on the market’s perception of a chain’s value. Ethereum’s ratio of 9.72 suggests a mature market. In contrast, Solana’s higher ratio of 43.49 indicates either potential growth opportunities or an undervalued ecosystem, warranting closer investor scrutiny.\n\nName Protocols Active Users 1D Change 7D Change 1M Change TVL Stablecoins 24h Volume 24h Fees Market Cap to TVL ratio 1.Ethereum 946 304,493 -0.12% +6.50% +31.14% $25.473b $64.929b $1.718b $7.27m 9.63 2.Tron 26 1.69m -1.34% +5.04% +25.14% $8.291b $47.455b $11.33m $1.66m 1.13 3.

While Solana has impressively risen by 15.89x against Ethereum, it appears that this may continue to be the case following Solana's recent collaboration with Render Network against Ethereum.\n\nThe transition of Render between Ethereum and Solana implies that there will be a reduction in the use of the Ethereum network, while the use of Solana will be increased as it will see new adoption from the users of Render.\n\nNonetheless, the Render Network has also instructed that while the ETH token ($RNDR) will remain, it will no longer be maintained by Render Foundation and won't function on the Render Network."}]

Considering the synthesized reports, it is advisable to prioritize assets with long-term growth potential like SOL while being cautious of bearish trends in other cryptocurrencies. A slightly conservative trading approach is warranted to navigate potential market fluctuations effectively and maximize overall profit in the long term.

Therefore, my trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.8, reflecting my belief in the bearish trend for ETH and my strategic decision to manage risk appropriately by focusing on assets with long-term growth potential like SOL.

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that ETH has been experiencing a steady increase in open price but with fluctuating transaction numbers and a consistent sell signal from the MACD indicator. This suggests potential resistance at current price levels and the need for caution in trading decisions. On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights a positive market trend for Solana (SOL) with strong institutional demand, price surges, and bullish predictions, indicating a favorable outlook for SOL.

Considering the reflection analyst report, which emphasizes a cautious and strategic approach focusing on long-term growth opportunities and effective risk management, it is evident that prioritizing assets with bullish trends like SOL while being cautious of bearish trends like ETH can lead to profitable outcomes. Therefore, a slightly conservative trading approach is recommended to navigate potential market fluctuations effectively and maximize overall profit in the long term.

Based on the synthesized reports, the clear market trend appears to favor SOL over ETH in the long term. Therefore, my trading action would be to buy SOL with a confidence level of 0.8, reflecting my belief in the positive market trend for SOL and my strategic decision to manage risk appropriately for long-term gains.

REASONING:
Based on the reports provided by the on-chain, news, and reflection analysts, it is evident that there is a bearish trend for Ethereum (ETH) in the current cryptocurrency market. The on-chain analysis indicates fluctuating transaction numbers and a sell trend according to the MACD signal.

Reflecting on the reports, it is clear that a strategic focus on long-term growth opportunities and effective risk management is crucial for maximizing profits in the cryptocurrency market. While short-term gains may be tempting, it is important to prioritize assets with bullish trends like Solana and be cautious of bearish trends like Ethereum.

Considering the synthesized reports and the emphasis on long-term strategies, I would take a slightly conservative approach in my trading decision.

FTX and its now-fallen leader Sam Bankman-Fried were widely credited with providing substantial money and resources behind the Solana project to get it off the ground.\n\nSolana is up about 550% this year and has been one of the best performing cryptocurrencies of 2023.

While retreating to $62 by the afternoon, it’s still up more than 35% on the week, according to CoinGecko. SOL is up more than 500% from a Jan. 1 price of $9.97.\n\nA jump in Bitcoin\'s price over the past couple of weeks helped lift the overall market. The most popular cryptocurrency advanced to just under $38,000 last week—and again on Wednesday—before falling back to earth. The coin was up less than 1%, near $36,600, as of publication.\n\nFueling that rise is speculation tied to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s impending action on a spot Bitcoin ETF, which analysts say could be approved by early January.\n\nBitcoin’s rosy performance has helped lift a group of altcoins led by Solana, the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap and a main competitor to second-ranked Ether.\n\nExchange-traded products representing an index of alternative coins increased by 26% in October, according to a Thursday report by digital asset investment company Fineqia. Meanwhile, ETPs holding SOL increased 172% in assets under management last month to $279 million from $102 million at the end of September. Last week alone, investors poured $12 million into ETPs tracking Solana, while pulling back from funds related to other altcoins like Litecoin and XRP, according to a report by CoinShares.\n\nSOL bottomed out near $9 toward the end of 2022 in the wake of FTX\'s meltdown. The coin had been mentioned among Sam Bankman-Fried\'s favorites, and it was mentioned frequently during former the FTX CEO\'s trial, but investors appear to have shrugged that off.\n\nThe Solana network is in the process of rolling out several improvements and has vastly improved on its downtime problem, which in past years took the network offline for hours at a time. The network has only had one such incident this year.\n\nAnother possible reason for Solana’s recent price increases could be a significant uptick in liquid staking, including through applications like Jito, Marinade, and MarginFi, said Max Shannon, a research analyst at CoinShares. Another driver could be an increase in open interest volume and funding rates fueled by a surge in liquidations, while some investors may just see it as a sound play, Shannon added.\n\n“The 94% price decline from peak to trough makes it an attractive proposition regardless of fundamentals, and investors could be starting to realize this,” Shannon said in an email.\n\nAnother analyst, Matteo Greco of Fineqia, cautioned that Solana’s price moves are closely tied to its pitiful performance near the end of 2022. Due in part to FTX and Alameda Research’s close association, and substantial exposure to SOL, the token fell drastically.\n\nDespite SOL\'s massive uptick, Greco noted, it\'s still way off its all-time high of nearly $260.\n\n“The remarkable uptrend in SOL," he added, "can be directly linked to the severe impact the token endured during the downturn."'}, {'id': 7, 'time': 'Thu, 16 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Why Hasn't Solana Died Yet? - hackernoon.com", 'content': 'Crypto market observers noticed a long time ago: after a significant surge in Bitcoin price, there always comes the “alts” time. The whole market seems to be dragged by the leading crypto, but some coins outperform the others.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the past month, Bitcoin surged 38%. Ethereum gained 32%. Meanwhile, Solana spiked 175%, and Grayscale’s GSOL trust shares skyrocketed to a jaw-dropping premium of 784%. This means that both retail and institutional investors are turning their eyes to this underdog blockchain, which has been declared dead so many times in the past.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolana is indeed infamous for numerous network outages, and its reputation was badly hurt by the FTX crash (the bankrupt exchange invested heavily in $SOL and co-founded the blockchain’s main DEX Serum).\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking of FTX: for the past two weeks, it has been selling between $250,000 and $700,000 worth of $SOL every day, creating additional selling pressure on the coin. Despite that, its price never ceased climbing.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point, the larger crypto (and not only) public starts wondering what’s the secret to Solana’s ability to bounce back after every obstacle. And why are investors rushing to it now, leaving the market leader Ethereum behind?\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s try to answer this question by looking at the current state of Solana and its main pros and cons: the outages, the activity, and the tokenomics. But first, a quick reminder of what sets this blockchain apart from its competitors.\n\nHow is Solana different from other blockchains?\n\nSolana is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain that relies on validators who stake its native currency $SOL. In addition to that, it also uses the so-called Proof of History mechanism, which allows it to speed up transaction validation, all while keeping the blockchain synchronized.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Traditional” blockchains synchronize on blocks, which means that a transaction cannot be processed until a block time has passed. To allow PoS blockchain validators to determine the order of the blocks, those need to be timestamped, and in order to counter the clock drift and network latencies, the block time needs to be lengthened.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolana is different in that its leader nodes “timestamp” the blocks with cryptographic proofs that some duration of time has passed since the last proof. Validator nodes verify these proofs in any order, allowing network participants to synchronize at their own pace.\n\nOverall, this system streamlines the transaction validation process and allows Solana to scale as its network grows.\n\nDid Solana resolve its outage problem?\n\nThis scaling promise has been challenged on multiple occasions, especially in 2022, when the network faced no less than 10 partial or full outages, some of them lasting many hours. On occasions, the Solana clock was also noticed to be running adrift of real-world time.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn November 2022, Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko admitted that the validator count doubling in the previous year put the system to the test and revealed a number of inherent problems. He ensured that the team was working on resolving them, and indeed, so far in 2023, the network suffered only one major outage in February. The current streak of 260 days of uptime is the second-best in Solana’s history. Whether it should be attributed to the upgrade-process improvements and new technical features, or rather the bear market’s relatively low network activity, remains to be seen.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year Yakovenko also announced that Solana Foundation had partnered with the development firm Jump Crypto to build an alternative client. Having a “second implementation and a second client developed by a different team with a fully separate code base” was supposed to help eliminate the same type of bugs.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis alternative validator client, named Firedancer, was revealed two weeks ago (in testnet version), at Solana’s Breakpoint conference in Amsterdam. $SOL gained over 66% since then.\n\nSolana today\n\nAs of today, Solana is the most used blockchain, as it processes around 37 million daily non-vote transactions – more than any other chain. For comparison, Ethereum processes around 1.1 million transactions per day. Adding its most popular layer-2s, this number can rise to 4.5 million (Polygon PoS 2.5M, zkSync 738k, Arbitrum 620k, Optimism 347k, Base 255k).\n\n\n\n\n\nSolana’s current TPS (transaction per second) stands at around 4000 (including vote transactions), and the developing team claims it can go up to 50,000. The blockchain counts nearly a million unique monthly active users and 2,000 validators.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year for Solana was marked by several important events, such as the release of its phone Saga, an Android reinforced with a native crypto custody system, and web3 integration. Solana was also chosen by VISA for USDC stablecoin settlement, and one of the DeFi OGs MakerDAO decided to leave Ethereum for a new blockchain forked off Solana.\n\n\n\n\n\nDeFi activity is steadily gaining intensity after a dramatic fall at the end of 2022, whi...'}, {'id': 6, 'time': 'Thu, 16 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT', 'title': "How Solana Works: A Beginner's Guide - Blockgeeks", 'content': 'Did you know that Solana, a high-performance blockchain platform in the crypto industry, processes over 65,000 transactions per second? Solana is often seen as an ethereum killer and is gaining popularity alongside bitcoin and cardano. That’s more than 10 times the bandwidth capacity of the crypto industry’s Ethereum and Bitcoin projects combined, on a standard gigabit network! Solana is revolutionizing the world of decentralized applications by providing lightning-fast solutions for developers and users in the crypto space. With its innovative approach, Solana is becoming a major player in the bitcoin and ethereum communities, offering scalable solutions that enhance the efficiency of projects and systems.\n\nUsing a unique combination of cutting-edge technologies, Solana uses ethereum and proof-of-stake (POS) to design a system that offers low transaction fees and high throughput, making it ideal for a wide range of projects. Ethereum uses an innovative consensus mechanism called Proof-of-History (PoH) to ensure secure and efficient data processing in the blockchain cluster. By leveraging the delegated proof of ethereum mechanism along with other advanced algorithms and protocols, Solana creates a robust network where participants can execute smart contracts seamlessly in the next block.\n\nWith its exceptional performance and design, Solana is poised to transform the way we interact with ethereum blockchain technology. Solana uses a cluster to achieve its outstanding speed and efficiency, making it a game-changing solution in the world of cryptocurrency.\n\nHow Does Solana Work? Exploring the Features\n\nSolana is an impressive blockchain platform that sets itself apart from others in the market with its efficient and scalable network of Ethereum nodes. Ethereum boasts several unique features that contribute to its scalability, speed, and overall user experience. These features include the ability to process transactions through nodes and the efficient validation of the next block. Let’s delve into these features and understand how Solana, with its next block and nodes, works.\n\nAbility to handle thousands of transactions per second\n\nOne of the standout features of Solana is its remarkable ability to handle thousands of transactions per second. While other blockchains like Ethereum struggle with scalability issues, Solana has found a way to overcome this hurdle. By utilizing an innovative architecture and advanced consensus mechanism, Solana can process a high volume of transactions simultaneously.\n\nLeveraging Proof-of-History for enhanced scalability and speed\n\nTo achieve its impressive transaction processing capabilities, Solana leverages a mechanism known as Proof-of-History (PoH). PoH enables the network to establish an ordered sequence of events or “proofs” that occur over time. This allows validators on the network to quickly verify the order and authenticity of transactions without relying solely on computation-based mechanisms like Proof-of-Work (PoW) or Proof-of-Stake (PoS).\n\nSupport for smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps)\n\nAnother key feature of Solana is its support for smart contracts, enabling developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) on the platform. Smart contracts are self-executing agreements that automatically execute predefined actions when certain conditions are met. With Solana’s smart contract functionality, developers have the freedom to create innovative dApps across various industries such as finance, gaming, supply chain management, and more.\n\nParallel transaction processing reducing congestion on the network\n\nSolana’s architecture allows for parallel transaction processing, which significantly reduces congestion on the network. Unlike traditional blockchains where each transaction must be processed sequentially in blocks, Solana employs a unique approach called “pipelining.” This means that multiple transactions can be processed simultaneously, improving overall throughput and reducing transaction confirmation times.\n\nImproved user experience compared to other blockchains\n\nWith its unique features and architecture, Solana offers an improved user experience compared to other blockchains. The ability to handle a high volume of transactions per second ensures that users can transact quickly and efficiently. The reduced congestion on the network leads to faster transaction confirmations and lower fees, making Solana an attractive choice for users seeking a seamless blockchain experience.\n\nUnderstanding the Technology and Mechanisms Behind Solana\n\nTo truly comprehend how Solana works, it’s essential to delve into the technology and mechanisms that power this innovative blockchain platform. Solana combines various algorithms and consensus mechanisms to achieve its impressive transaction throughput and scalability.\n\nProof-of-History (PoH) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS)\n\nSolana employs a unique consensus algorithm called Proof-of-History (PoH), which works in conjuncti...'}]

Essentially, a backdoor can supposedly be installed on the phone allowing the initial software responsible for the starting of the device to be compromised.\n\n“The boot loader is unlocked and software integrity cannot be guaranteed. Any data stored on the device may be available to attackers, Do not store any sensitive data on the device,” a screengrab from CertiK’s accompanying video shows the Solana phone’s screen following the backdoor install.\n\nThe message is an indication that the phone has been hacked, CertiK said. However, it’s not clear if the vulnerability is unique to Saga or if it could impact other Android devices. CertiK did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nIn an email to Blockworks, Steven Laver, lead software engineer of mobile at Solana Labs said that “the CertiK video does not reveal any known vulnerability or security threat to Saga holders. The video shows the user unlocking the bootloader, which is something that can be done on many Android devices.”\n\nAndroid’s own documentation from its Open Source Project outlines the ability to lock and unlock the bootloader.\n\n“Unlocking the bootloader is an advanced feature of Saga, and is disabled by default. We believe in allowing users the choice of how they use their phone, however, unlocking the bootloader is not a security vulnerability – a user must explicitly allow such changes to be made to their device, and those changes can only be made by an authorized user of the phone,” Laver continued.\n\nHowever, if a user or attacker proceeds to unlock the bootloader, then they not only go through multiple warnings, but their device is wiped — along with their private keys.\n\n“So it’s not a process that can take place without users’ active participation or awareness,” Laver said.\n\nCertiK, however, said that only being able to unlock the bootloader with user participation “does not eliminate all potential threats.”\n\n“Malicious actors can purchase Saga phones and install backdoors through such ‘feature,’ and deliver devices to unconscious users. If users did not understand the warnings, they would be tricked and lose funds to attackers,” CertiK said in an email to Blockworks.\n\n“In addition, given the fact that a considerable portion of traditional phone users have taken the initiative to jailbreak or unlock their devices in the past, it is also likely that some Saga phone users will also explore this “feature” but without enough security awareness. That’s why we warn users about such situations in our video.”\n\nThe video then proceeds to show how an attacker could drain bitcoin from the wallet attached to the phone.

FTX Derivatives Exchange declared bankruptcy late last year and has begun selling off its Solana holdings. Many investors wonder whether the token will pull back and turn downward.\n\nTo remain safe, retail investors have turned to InQubeta (QUBE), a rising AI cryptocurrency with the potential to transform their portfolios with immense returns. The project propels the growth of the AI industry by making provisions for fractionated investments in AI tech startups set up on the blockchain. These investments are minted into trending NFTs (non-fungible tokens) and traded on the platform’s NFT marketplace. This article explores InQubeta’s rise as the go-to investment option for retail investors while delving into Solana’s path to discover the possibilities of a pullback.\n\nInQubeta (QUBE): Crowdfunding On The Blockchain\n\nInQubeta has been on an upward trend since it first launched its presale, attracting investors with its low entry price and impressive features. The blockchain ICO has recorded the sale of over 495 million QUBE tokens, raising over $4.8 million. Retail investors are currently acquiring tokens in its fifth stage, aiming to earn substantial returns when the tokens are listed. With a DeFi coin price of $0.0161, QUBE has the potential to rise by almost 100% when it lists at a proposed price of $0.0308.\n\nThe current stage of the presale has nearly sold out, with only about 20% left to be purchased. Upon completion, the project would enter the sixth stage and sell at a DeFi coin price of $0.01925 apiece. Holders can further stake their tokens in a protocol that rewards them with a percentage of pooled buy-and-sell tax funds. InQubeta adds more functionality to its platform, making it user-centric by giving holders governance rights. They can vote on projects and decisions to propel the token to greater heights on the decentralized cryptocurrency list.\n\nThis blockchain ICO stands out with features that showcase the power of decentralized finance. Holders can invest regardless of their budgets because investment options are minted into fractionated smart contracts. This revolutionary approach also favors the AI industry, allowing startups to grow and realize their missions through crowdfunding. Investors get rewarded with added utility as these startups begin to grow and turn a profit. The trending NFTs can be traded in the marketplace, allowing investors to shift their focus to other startups as they please.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nSolana (SOL): Rising Amid Liquidation\n\nSolana is one of the fastest-growing crypto coins, with a market capitalization of over $22 billion, putting it in seventh place on the decentralized cryptocurrency list. Over the past month, this open-source DeFi project has witnessed an impressive growth trajectory, rising by over 170%, according to on-chain analysis. This incredible path has ground to a halt with a predicted pullback as the bankrupt FTX Exchange sells off its SOL holdings.\n\nThe exchange transferred 250,000 Solana tokens worth nearly $14 million to Kraken. This sudden move caused a dip in the token’s market value, causing it to fall by about 8%. Investors are skeptical about the possibility of a significant downturn in the token’s bullish trend, and there is still hope that it will recover. According to on-chain analysis from Lookonchain, FTX’s Solana liquidity has stopped, with about 3,408 SOL left, worth only around $185,000.\n\nConclusion\n\nVolatility is not news in the crypto industry, and investors are wisely making decisions around this factor. Retail investors are flocking to InQubeta’s presale as they recognize this blockchain ICO as the go-to for diversifying their portfolios and claiming a significant return on investment (ROI). SOL holders also expect a more favorable analysis as FTX sell-offs round up. These top crypto coins represent the ever-changing dynamics of the crypto market. Investors who purchase QUBE quickly before the fifth stage runs out will improve their ROI potential upon launch.\n\nVisit InQubeta Presale\n\nJoin The InQubeta Communities\n\n\n\nContact Info:\n\nName: Lee Freemans\n\nEmail: Send Email\n\nOrganization: InQubeta\n\nWebsite: https://inqubeta.ai/\n\n\n\nRelease ID: 89113515\n\nIn the event of any inaccuracies, problems, or queries arising from the content shared in this press release, we encourage you to notify us immediately at error@releasecontact.com.

And personally, I think Solana is a long shot in the long term. Here’s why.\n\nThere Can Be Only One (or Two)\n\nOur first investing thesis is that while lots of experiments happen in the early stages of a new technology, ultimately only one (or sometimes two) big platforms survive in the long run. (Think PCs and Macs, Androids and iPhones, etc.)\n\nIn the traditional tech world, this is because big players get bigger, mostly through network effects: the bigger you get, the easier for new customers to join you. The smaller companies either get acquired, or driven out of business.\n\nThis is how we end up with Google gobbling up all the search business, OpenAI overtaking AI, and Salesforce forcing out other CRMs.\n\nIn the emergent world of blockchain technology, we are only just starting to understand what the categories even are. But one category is definitely smart contract platforms (a.k.a. Layer 1s), the operating system for crypto.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is, by all measures, the 800-pound gorilla in this space. They have the most users, the most revenue, the most developers. So for a competing Layer-1 like Solana, Ethereum is the one to beat.\n\nFor all the hype, let’s look at how Solana stacks up:\n\nEthereum Solana Daily Active Users 300,000 100,000 Daily Fees $5,000,000 $50,000 Active Developers 200 75\n\nSource: Token Terminal (rounded for readability)\n\nThis is not to say that Solana must beat Ethereum in order to survive. Niche search engines like DuckDuckGo or WolframAlpha (I’m still waiting for WolframBeta) have survived against Google. But their market share is tiny by comparison.\n\nAs long-term investors, we don’t want to pick the projects that will survive; we want to pick the projects that will thrive. The numbers above show you that Solana has traction, but it still has a way to go.\n\nIt’s Not the Technology, It’s the Users\n\nBlockchain nerds get really excited about Solana’s faster throughput (due to its Proof of History consensus algorithm vs. Ethereum’s Proof of Stake), and its developer friendliness (they can use languages like Rust and C, vs. having to learn Ethereum’s Solidity).\n\nThe tech crowd gets really excited about the tech, but no one else does. This is because the market does not really care about technology, the market cares about the users.\n\nIf a company is building a new blockchain application, where would they want to build it?\n\nThe one with a better consensus algorithm, or the one where more users are going to be able to use it?\n\nThe one with an easier programming language, or the one that’s going to generate more revenue and fees?\n\nThe underdog, or the existing leader?\n\nCompanies will generally go with bigger tech platforms, because they’re a safer bet. There’s safety in numbers.\n\nBut what about investors? My experience is that investors also do not really care about the technology, they care about whether they can make money. The technology is only relevant if it’s going to lead to a higher price multiple in the end.\n\nVHS vs. Betamax, MP3 vs. FLAC, QWERTY vs. any other keyboard layout: often the inferior technology wins. In blockchain, especially, the tech is only relevant if it leads to more users.\n\nMore users = more network effects = more value.\n\nYou want to find winning long-term investments? Look for blockchain projects with userbases that are large and growing. (Remember that before this recent price rally, the crypto outlets were bemoaning Solana’s drop in daily users.)\n\nWhere are the Killer Apps?\n\nLayer 1s are like operating systems: to grab those critical users, you’ve got to have some killer apps. For example, VisiCalc put the Apple II on the map, AOL introduced the Internet to the masses, and Siri made the iPhone indispensable.\n\n(In blockchain, we call them decentralized apps or “dapps,” but c’mon, they’re just apps.)\n\nOn Solana, you’ve got the usual assortment of dapps: a DEX (Serum), an AMM (Raydium), wallets (Phantom), borrowing/lending (Solend), NFT marketplaces (Magic Eden). I think of these as copycats of bigger, more popular dapps on Ethereum.\n\nHowever, there are a few dapps that take advantage of Solana tech:\n\nThe decentralized music platform Audius lets artists publish directly to listeners and cut out the middleman, using Solana’s higher throughput and lower transaction fees to handle a large volume of microtransactions.\n\nThe MMO game Star Atlas runs a complex game economy with real-time transactions—all those tiny transactions are easier and faster to process on Solana than Ethereum.\n\nMango Markets offers decentralized spot trading and perpetual futures, which is nothing new, but Sol...'}, {'id': 9, 'time': 'Fri, 17 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Everything You Need To Know About Investing In Solana In 2023 - Blockchain Magazine', 'content': 'Investing in Solana refers to purchasing and holding the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) with the expectation that its value will increase over time.

Solana is both a blockchain platform and a native cryptocurrency that aims to provide fast, scalable, and secure decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts.\n\nHere are some key points to understand about investing in Solana:\n\nCryptocurrency Potential: Solana is considered a promising project within the cryptocurrency space due to its innovative technology and potential to address scalability issues faced by other blockchain platforms like Ethereum. Many investors are attracted to Solana’s high throughput and low transaction fees, which make it an appealing platform for developers and users. Growth and Adoption: Solana has gained significant attention and adoption since its launch in 2020. It has attracted numerous developers and projects, resulting in a growing ecosystem of decentralized applications built on the Solana blockchain. Increased usage and adoption can potentially drive up the value of SOL tokens. Market Performance: The value of SOL tokens can fluctuate widely due to market dynamics, investor sentiment, and external factors affecting the cryptocurrency market as a whole. It’s important to note that investing in cryptocurrencies can be highly volatile, and prices can experience rapid and substantial changes. Research and Due Diligence: Before investing in Solana or any cryptocurrency, it is essential to conduct thorough research and due diligence. Understand Solana’s technology, its competitive advantages, the team behind the project, and its roadmap for future development. Additionally, consider factors like market trends, regulatory landscape, and risk tolerance. Diversification: Cryptocurrency investments should typically be part of a well-diversified investment portfolio. Diversification helps to mitigate risks by spreading investments across different asset classes, reducing the impact of potential losses from a single investment. Risk Considerations: Investing in cryptocurrencies, including Solana, involves inherent risks. These risks include market volatility, regulatory uncertainties, technological vulnerabilities, and the potential for fraud or hacking. It’s crucial to assess your risk tolerance and only invest what you can afford to lose.\n\nWhy not? We’re directly investing in the growth of Solana and creating value for our holders at the same time. What more could you possibly want? — Noto | Turtles 🔼🐢 (@notonft) May 27, 2023\n\nBenifits of investing in Solana\n\nHere are some potential benefits of investing in Solana:\n\nScalability and Speed: Solana is designed to offer high scalability and transaction speeds. Its unique consensus mechanism, called Proof of History (PoH), along with other innovative technologies, enables Solana to handle a large number of transactions per second (TPS) at low costs. This scalability potential may attract developers and users to the Solana ecosystem, leading to increased adoption and potential value appreciation. Robust Infrastructure: Solana has a strong infrastructure that supports decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. It provides developers with a flexible and powerful toolkit to build and deploy smart contracts, making it an attractive platform for developers and entrepreneurs looking to create blockchain-based applications.

From September 17th to November 17th, the number of new addresses grew from 193.94K to 336.03K, indicating increasing participation and interest in the Solana network. This surge in new addresses typically signals rising demand for SOL and broader adoption of the network.\n\nExponential Moving Average (EMA): The upward slope of the 20-day EMA could provide substantial support during a potential pullback in the SOL price.\n\nAverage Directional Index (ADX): Currently at a high of 74%, the ADX indicates a likelihood of exhausted bullish momentum, suggesting that a corrective phase might be necessary for SOL.'}, {'id': 5, 'time': 'Sat, 18 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'The Hives at the Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach, CA - Loud Hailer Magazine', 'content': 'The Hives rocked the Belly Up Tavern with an unrelenting garage rock attack, supported by Kate Clover’s electrifying opening set.\n\nIn a sonic storm that swept through the intimate confines of the Belly Up Tavern, Swedish garage-rock maestros The Hives delivered a relentless performance that left the audience in the tiny club wrapt and at the edge of exhilaration. Supported by the equally dynamic Kate Clover, the night unfolded as an ear-shattering testament to the enduring power of raw, unbridled rock ‘n’ roll.\n\nKate Clover, a rising force in the alternative rock scene, set the stage ablaze with her opening act. The sharply dressed quartet with frontwoman, Clover, commanded the spotlight with a blend of punk-infused riffs and a magnetic stage presence, wasted no time breaking the ice, and went hard wire-to-wire from the opening note to the last instrument-dropping note. Her raspy vocals cut through the air like a serrated blade, adding an extra edge to her guitar-driven melodies. With tracks like “Channel Zero” and “Love You to Death,” Clover’s set served as a fitting prelude to the high-octane sonic assault that was about to unfold.\n\nAs The Hives took the stage, they left no doubt as to why they were there. This tour is in support of their new album The Death of Randy Fitzsimmons. From the opening notes of “Bogus Operandi,” The Hives put the hammer down and did not let off the gas until the final notes of the “Tick Tick Boom.” Decked out in their traditional black-and-white attire, only now with custom glow-in-the-dark trim, the band launched into their set with the precision of a well-oiled machine. Frontman Howlin’ Pelle Almqvist, a charismatic dynamo, led the charge with his electrifying stage presence, engaging the audience with a combination of swagger and infectious energy.\n\nThe setlist, a carefully curated selection of classics and newer material, showcased The Hives’ ability to craft anthems that resonate across generations. “Hate To Say I Told You So” and “Tick Tick Boom” elicited raucous singalongs, while tracks from their latest album demonstrated that the band hasn’t lost an ounce of their edge over the years. The seamless transitions between songs kept the momentum at a fever pitch, creating a sonic rollercoaster that had the crowd in a perpetual state of frenzy. The one-hour set seemingly the perfect amount of time to release a frenzy of energy without wearing out the audience.\n\nGuitarists Nicholaus Arson and Vigilante Carlstroem unleashed a barrage of fast and furious riffs, their guitars serving as a unified sonic weapon that punctuated each song with a staccato ferocious intensity. The rhythm section, comprised of bassist Chris Dangerous and drummer Chris Dangerous, laid down a foundation of pulsating beats that reverberated through the venue, ensuring that the audience was engulfed in a sonic onslaught from every angle in the intimate confines of the Belly Up.\n\nWhat set this performance apart was the band’s ability to establish an intimate connection with the audience. Almqvist’s banter between songs felt like a conversation with old friends, infusing the set with a sense of camaraderie and unbridled joy. As if you were at the neighborhood Friday night keg party. The intimacy Pelle and the band created transcended the typical performer-audience dynamic. The charismatic frontman’s interactions were both humorous and heartfelt, adding a personal touch to the sonic spectacle. The show gave a vibe of as if you were at a friend’s garage or backyard party.\n\nThe lighting design, a mesmerizing dance of strobe and shadows, enhanced the overall experience. As the stark white stage lights pulsated in sync with the music, the atmosphere became charged with an electric energy that mirrored the band’s fervor. The intimate setting of the Belly Up Tavern amplified this sensory immersion, creating an unforgettable sonic landscape that enveloped the audience.\n\nThe Hives’ performance at the Belly Up Tavern, supported by the electrifying Kate Clover, was nothing short of a stripped-down rock ‘n’ roll revival. From the opening chords to the final encore, the evening was a masterclass in musical intensity, proving that, decades into their career, The Hives are still a force to be reckoned with. This was not just a concert; it was a sonic baptism blasting through even the best ear protection. The Hives are a reminder of the enduring power of live music to captivate and transport audiences into the heart of rock ‘n’ roll.\n\nTHE HIVES\n\nWebsite Facebook Twitter\n\nKATE CLOVER\n\nWebsite Facebook Twitter\n\nBELLY UP TAVERN\n\nWebsite Facebook Twitter'}, {'id': 3, 'time': 'Sat, 18 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'These Are All the Solana Games on the Epic Games Store Right Now - Decrypt', 'content': 'Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nSolana’s token price has spiked in the past month—but do you know about the Solana blockchain-enabled games listed on the Epic Games Store?\n\nThis year, the number of Web3 games on the Epic Games Store has grown from just 10 in January to 69 in October, according to Game7’s 2023 State of Web3 Gaming Report (Decrypt counted at least 78 in November). While many of these games are unreleased or in early access, their listings are reflective of Epic Games’ more open approach to hosting titles with crypto or AI elements compared to rival PC game launcher Steam.\n\nSolana has a little over 125 games in its ecosystem, according to Game7’s report, making it the fourth most-popular blockchain network for game developers overall and the top most popular non-EVM chain. From ambitious sci-fi MMOs to fantasy pet battlers, here’s every game listed on the Epic Games Store that uses the Solana blockchain as of this writing.\n\nStar Atlas\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStar Atlas is a sci-fi MMORPG in development that uses Solana for its tokens and NFTs. Early access footage of the game shows an immersive world full of massive spaceships, modern structures, and futuristic apparel for its third-person perspective playable characters.\n\nDespite Star Atlas studio ATMTA laying off 73% of its team back in July, development has continued on the upcoming game. In September 2022, ATMTA released a playable demo for Star Atlas NFT holders on the Epic Games Store.\n\nATMTA has also continued to promote Solana blockchain game development, launching an open-source software development kit (SDK) that could make it easier for developers to build games using the network. Star Atlas does not currently have a release date, but it is slated to release on the Epic Games Store in the future.\n\nWhile fans wait for the finished game to launch, there’s SAGE Labs—a blockchain browser project that leverages Star Atlas lore—to try out in the meantime.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAurory\n\nAurory is a free-to-play fantasy RPG whose executive producer has described the title as “Pokémon meets the Matrix.” While Aurory originally released its NFTs and AURY token on Solana, its team revealed its multi-chain plans in July and plans to expand to the Ethereum layer-2 network Arbitrum as well.\n\nIn November, Aurory announced that its RPG expansion “Seekers of Tokane” will be released on the Epic Games Store as well as in its native browser version. Aurory EP Jonathan Campeau previously explained to Decrypt that the move to launch a desktop version on the Epic Store is in part due to technical limitations imposed by a web browser.\n\nAurory’s Seekers of Tokane will offer players “unlimited amounts” of land to explore through portals, expanded Netfies battle features, and character customization, among other additions to the game. Seekers of Tokane does not yet have a firm release date on the Epic Games Store and is listed as “Coming Soon” at time of writing.\n\nYaku\n\nYaku is a free-to-play social metaverse game that currently supports the Solana and Ethereum blockchains. At time of writing, Yaku is available on the Epic Games Store in early access. Its Epic Store page states that the game is currently in alpha and is focused on enabling user-generated content and community-fueled development.\n\nYaku’s Epic Store page describes plans for an open-world, dystopian sci-fi environment where an “omnipotent mega-corporation Saikou reigns supreme.” The game world will be released slowly with incremental updates over the next five to seven years, according to Yaku’s Epic Store page FAQ.\n\nChain Crisis\n\nChain Crisis is billed as a free-to-play cyberpunk dystopian shooter game set in the fictional near-future world of Warpgate City. At time of writing, it’s in pre-alpha and listed on the Epic Games Store with the “Coming Soon” label, slated for release sometime in 2024.\n\nChain Crisis has released male PFP-style avatar NFTs on Solana and plans to offer players in-game character cosmetics as NFTs.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAngelic: Dark Symphony\n\nAngelic is a sci-fi RPG that will offer multiplayer, co-op, and single-player game modes, according to its Epic Games Store page. Back in March 2022, the Angelic team raised $10 million for its game from Animoca Brands, Pantera, and Solana Capital, to name a few.\n\nAt time of writing, Angelic: Dark Symphony is listed as “Coming Soon” from its developers at Metaverse Game Studios, who are using Solana and Ethereum for its optional NFT elements.\n\nDark Symphony is Angelic’s single-player campaign mode. According to its Epic Store FAQ, the Angelic team says it will “never” add any “pay-to-win” or “play-to-earn” game mechanics, calling such models “toxic and unsustainable.”\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward'}, {'id': 4, 'time': 'Sat, 18 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Op-ed: Are we heading for a Solana DeFi Summer? - CryptoSlate', 'content': 'The crypto summer of 2020/21 saw most alternative Layer 1 protocols skyrocket to insane valuations and many projects in their respective ecosystems. This period became known to the wider industry as ‘DeFi Summer.’ With stimulus checks being handed out across the West and the looming uncertainty over the lifting of COVID lockdowns, the economic issues of the time spurred a tornado of wealth with seemingly exponential potential/possibility.\n\nLasting until May of 2021, this 6-month period of prosperity was followed by a long bear market, which could now be nearing its end, as suggested by recent market activity.\n\nThis has spurred rumors across the crypto sphere of a DeFi Summer 2.0. Several factors, including a recent surge in TVL, point towards this cycle starting not on Ethereum but on the Solana blockchain instead – what started these whispers, and what are the chances of follow through?’\n\nOvercoming Ethereum’s Hurdles: The Democratisation of DeFi Onboarding\n\nPersistent negative factors surrounding Ethereum are perhaps the strongest signs of a Solana-led DeFi Summer being on its way. The Ethereum chain has ongoing problems with high activity resulting in bloated gas fees and prices, which deter many people away from using it. This particular issue was evident during the last DeFi Summer. Solutions have arisen to help fix this problem since in the form of Layer 2s (Arbitrum, Optimism, Loopring, Base, ZkSync + others).\n\nThe economic hurdle presented by Ethereum’s high usage costs, combined with the complex nature of understanding and utilizing Layer 2 solutions, makes Ethereum less accessible to the average person. In contrast, Solana offers a lower-cost, more user-friendly platform for crypto engagement.\n\nSolana is an Ethereum-adjacent blockchain that defines itself in terms of its focus on ease of use for new consumers and potential for mass adoption.\n\nSolana’s ‘native’ crypto wallet is Phantom, an intuitive, easy-to-use wallet also available on mobile. Within Phantom, users can store coins, and NFTs and natively stake the Solana token. Phantom is synonymous with Solana in the way that MetaMask is with Ethereum, the flagship wallet of the blockchain. Phantom grew from 40,000 users to 1.8 million in July-Dec 2021, which has since doubled to 3 million users, setting its sights on an end goal of 10 million weekly active users.\n\nWith crypto adoption traditionally being hindered by difficult setup and onboarding processes due to the complexity of wallets and security, the UI/UX of Phantom allows newcomers to learn the ins and outs of crypto with ease and quickly begin their journey in the Solana ecosystem.\n\nOwning 1 SOL vs Owning 1 ETH\n\nAnother advantage of Solana is the SOL cryptocurrency itself: $SOL currently sits at $57. Owning 1 Solana is attainable for most people, while owning 1 Ethereum is not. This removes a huge psychological price barrier for a new on-chain user.\n\nIf an amateur crypto investor sees that they can begin experimenting with $50 and become accustomed to low gas fees, fast transaction speeds, and the ability to bounce between protocols without hesitation, then transferring to Ethereum would seem alien\n\nBoth blockchains will, of course, co-exist; however, considering Ethereum’s current status (not including layer 2s and future upgrades), most people cannot afford $30 to make 1 transaction out of their first $100 to test out crypto.\n\nPaying $0.0003 in fees to move the same $100 will hold wider appeal.\n\nIs Solana ready for a DeFi boom?\n\nData from DeFiLlama reveals that during the height of the DeFi Summer, Solana achieved a Total Value Locked (TVL) of $9.9 billion from 55.1 million transactions, accomplishing this with significantly less infrastructure than it has now.\n\nThe recent and anticipated airdrops from various Solana projects have shifted focus toward the platform. As more people enter the world of crypto, Solana is increasingly becoming their first choice owing to its affordability, speed, and user-friendliness, a deal sweetened by the prospect of receiving airdrops. With free tokens offered by an accessible platform, why would new users need to look elsewhere?\n\nPotential airdrops are another incentive that will attract users to Solana. While most of Ethereum’s major DApps have already conducted airdrops, only a few of Solana’s dapps have done so.\n\nWhile market conditions are improving daily, signaling a potential bull market on the horizon, these platforms will expand and attract more capital. This should, in turn, lead to more frequent airdrops. Consider a scenario where person A informs person B about receiving easy value from an airdrop in the crypto world. Naturally, person B will have their curiosity piqued and will likely emulate person A’s actions in the hope of benefiting from such opportunities. Such chain reactions will be easily facilitated by Solana.\n\nThe chain’s infrastructure has advanced significantly, expanding the surrounding community rapidly. The success of the rec...'}]

The recent news articles suggest that there is a potential shift in sentiment towards Solana (SOL) due to large withdrawals by whales, causing a drop in price but with positive social media sentiment and strong network performance. Additionally, the presence of Solana-based games on the Epic Games Store and the anticipation of a DeFi boom on the Solana blockchain indicate growing interest and adoption. This combination of factors could lead to a short-term correction in SOL price followed by a potential bullish trend as more users and capital flow into the Solana ecosystem, especially if the network continues to demonstrate strong performance and attract new users through user-friendly features and potential airdrops.

Drivers of Solana’s Surge: Solana’s growth is linked to the broader positive crypto market trend, institutional interest, Coinbase’s SOL perpetual futures listing, and endorsements from industry figures like Cathie Wood.\n\nCan SOL Surpass XRP?\n\nSolana’s native token – SOL – has captured much attention lately due to its considerable price increase.

The platform has also announced several exciting partnerships, including a notable collaboration with Visa, dispelling any lingering doubts over its narrative.\n\nMoving on to evaluating Solana’s value, Goel emphasized the inherent difficulty in valuing Layer-1 tokens but outlined potential scenarios based on specific assumptions.\n\nIn Scenario 1, if the cost of transactions is fixed, the analysis reveals that Solana would require an astounding 13 billion non-vote transactions daily or approximately 150,000 non-vote transactions per second (TPS) to achieve a net 0% inflation. However, the current network capacity falls short of supporting such a high transaction volume.\n\nProjecting Solana’s Needs In 2030\n\nLooking ahead to Scenario 2 in 2030, with the launch of Firedancer and a gross inflation rate of 1.5%, Solana would need around 50,000 non-vote TPS to maintain zero net inflation. It, Goel notes, is only achievable through the widespread adoption of high-throughput applications like social media, payments, trading, or DePIN.\n\nAlternatively, the analysis explores the transaction activity required to support different SOL prices at zero net inflation by fixing the fee per transaction in dollar terms. Under Scenario 2 growth (approximately 50,000 non-vote TPS), Solana could potentially support a price of $500. At current activity levels, the platform can sustain a price of $5 with net zero inflation.\n\nAdding to the positive momentum, Santiment reported that Solana experienced another surge in market value over the weekend. Traders successfully pushed prices above $60 for the first time since May 2022, with a noticeable increase in FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). According to Santiment, positivity around $SOL is now at its highest level over a year.\n\n🥳 #Solana has seen yet another leg up in its market value this weekend, and traders have now officially pushed prices above $60 for the first time since May, 2022. $SOL #FOMO has picked up in a big way, with positivity at its highest level in over a year. https://t.co/04Tabsz5Hs pic.twitter.com/uzEG56w6RY — Santiment (@santimentfeed) November 19, 2023\n\nRelated Reading | dYdX Deploys $13.5 Million Insurance Fund After $38 Million Liquidation Event'}, {'id': 23, 'time': 'Sun, 19 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Solana Blockchain Games Thrive on the Epic Games Store – Next Big Thing? - Cryptonews', 'content': 'Solana Blockchain Games Thrive on the Epic Games Store – Next Big Thing?\n\nThe number of Web3 games on the Solana (SOL) blockchain has grown substantially amid the spike in the network’s native token over the past month.\n\nAccording to Game7’s 2023 State of Web3 Gaming Report, the number of crypto games on the Epic Games Store has increased from 10 in January to 69 in October.\n\nThe report also revealed that Solana currently boasts a little over 125 games in its ecosystem, making it the fourth most popular blockchain network for game developers overall and the top non-EVM chain.\n\nThese games encompass a range of genres, from ambitious sci-fi MMOs to fantasy pet battlers.\n\n“Solana remains the largest non-EVM ecosystem of Web3 games,” the report said.\n\nMajor Solana-Based Games\n\n\n\nStar Atlas, a sci-fi MMORPG in development, is one of the many games that has chosen Solana for its tokens and NFTs.\n\nEarly access footage showcases an immersive world replete with massive spaceships, modern structures, and futuristic apparel for its playable characters.\n\nDespite some setbacks, such as the studio behind the game laying off 73% of its team in July, development has been going on.\n\nIn September 2022, a playable demo for Star Atlas NFT holders was released on the Epic Games Store.\n\nAnother Solana-based game, Aurory, a free-to-play fantasy RPG, combines elements of Pokémon and the Matrix.\n\nWhile originally releasing its NFTs and AURY token on Solana, the team revealed plans to expand to the Ethereum layer-2 network Arbitrum in July.\n\nAurory recently announced that its RPG expansion, “Seekers of Tokane,” will be available on the Epic Games Store alongside its native browser version.\n\nSeekers of Tokane promises players limitless lands to explore, expanded battle features, and character customization. Although a firm release date on the Epic Games Store is yet to be announced, it is listed as “Coming Soon.”\n\nFurthermore, Yaku, a free-to-play social metaverse game, currently supports both the Solana and Ethereum blockchains.\n\nIt is in early access on the Epic Games Store, with a focus on user-generated content and community-driven development.\n\nThe game envisions a dystopian sci-fi environment ruled by the omnipotent mega-corporation Saikou. Yaku plans to gradually release the game world through incremental updates over the next five to seven years.\n\nMoreover, Chain Crisis, described as a free-to-play cyberpunk dystopian shooter set in the fictional near-future world of Warpgate City, is listed on the Epic Games Store as “Coming Soon.”\n\nIt has already released male PFP-style avatar NFTs on Solana and intends to offer in-game character cosmetics as NFTs.\n\nFinally, Angelic, a sci-fi RPG, offers multiplayer, co-op, and single-player game modes.\n\nThe Angelic team raised $10 million for the game, with support from Animoca Brands, Pantera, and Solana Capital.\n\nAngelic: Dark Symphony, the single-player campaign mode, is listed as “Coming Soon” on the Epic Games Store.\n\nThe developers use Solana and Ethereum for optional NFT elements and have committed to never implementing “pay-to-win” or “play-to-earn” mechanics, considering such models “toxic and unsustainable.”'}, {'id': 14, 'time': 'Sun, 19 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'ChatGPT expects Solana to set this price target for 2024 - AMBCrypto English', 'content': "Disclaimer: The information presented does not constitute financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice and is solely the writer’s opinion.\n\nIt has been one month since the crypto price rally began due to speculations around exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Solana [SOL] has achieved one of the most remarkable price surges among all the cryptocurrencies during the ongoing bull run.\n\nSince mid-October, SOL’s price has surged by more than 160%. It was trading at $57.86 at press time.\n\nWe recently witnessed some large-scale whale activity too. On 12 November, for instance, Whale Alert reported two substantial Solana transactions, each exceeding $30 million.\n\nThe first transaction involved the transfer of 325,222 SOL, valued at over $18.6 million, to Binance. The second transfer consisted of 199,998 tokens, valued at over $11.5 million, sent to the Coinbase exchange.\n\nClearly, the token is a major player in the crypto market, attracting a large number of investors. That is why AMBCrypto has looked at Solana’s price fortunes in the past too.\n\nHow it began… Solana journey\n\nSolana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko published a whitepaper in late 2017, describing the proof of history (PoH) consensus mechanism.\n\nSolana combined both PoH and proof of stake (PoS) on its blockchain project. It is critical at this juncture that we understand what both these mechanisms\n\nPoH is a proof for verifying order and passage of time between events, is used to encode trustless passage of time into a ledger. PoS requires validators to stake some of their coins as collateral. The network then chooses a validator at random to construct a new block depending on stake size and other parameters.\n\nBuilt by San Francisco-based Solana Labs, Solana got launched in 2017. The open-source blockchain project is currently run by Geneva-based Solana Foundation.\n\nDisruptive “Ethereum killer”\n\nSolana’s launch was a major disrupter in the crypto industry as it challenged the dominance of Ethereum [ETH]. So much so that it came to be known as “Ethereum killer.”\n\nMuch of the buzz surrounding Solana was due to its distinct advantage over Ethereum in terms of transaction processing speed and transaction costs. Solana can process as many as 50,000 transactions per second (TPS), and its average cost per transaction is $0.00025. In contrast, Ethereum can only handle less than 15 TPS, while average transaction fees are around $1.68.\n\nAs a result, the blockchain network onboarded a large number of enthusiasts.\n\nAccording to on-chain analyst Patrick Scott, Solana’s DEX volume has been skyrocketing in recent days. He also referred to the recovering Total Value Locked (TVL).\n\nDEX Volume on Solana exploding the past few days. Important to note that Solana's volume over the past 24 hours has been nearly 3X its total DEX TVL ($424M vs $153M). In comparison, other major chains have less 24 hour volume than TVL.

Mumtaz said TVL was a “noisy” metric. He also pointed out that SOL easily trumped Ethereum when it came to TPS.\n\nRyan, you have absolutely no idea what you're doing lol TVL and active addresses are easily gamed, noisy metrics — especially in the context of people who farm L2 airdrops Solana does more TPS than all those combined while being 100x cheaper and having a much larger community — mert | helius.dev (@0xMert_) November 3, 2023\n\nRead Solana’s [SOL] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nHas Solana managed to contain its outages??\n\nHowever, the network was notorious for its outages.

As it stands, there is a likelihood that BONK’s price will drop.\n\nThis projection was because market players may deem it fit to take profits.

The 2022-2023 bear market has been characterized by a continuous build out of infrastructure, to lay the groundwork for future growth.\n\nYet arguments about the best way to scale abound, they often fall into one of two camps.\n\nOne is “modular,” with its standard-bearers Ethereum and Cosmos. The other is “monolithic” which has come to be dominated in the crypto zeitgeist by Solana — although they prefer the term “integrated.”\n\nAn essay published Friday by pseudonymous Ethereum advocate Polynya critiquing monolithic blockchains, while not mentioning it by name, has been interpreted by many as a veiled critique of Solana.\n\nThe critique comes against a backdrop of swelling interest in the network spurred by a significant price surge in Solana’s native crypto asset (SOL), which is up 140% in the past month with a market cap approaching $25 billion\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nWhile often praised for its high transaction speed and low fees, Solana has faced criticism in the past for network instability, including outright outages, and high hardware requirements to operate validating nodes\u200b\u200b.\n\nResponding to perceived shortcomings, Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder of Solana, has acknowledged some network flaws, but contends the Solana community has worked diligently to mitigate them.\n\nYakovenko views these challenges as part of the network’s growth, likening them to historical issues faced by other major networks like Ethereum and Bitcoin.\n\nPlans include the mid-2024 launch of Firedancer, the first independent validator client software for Solana (Ethereum has 5), which is expected to increase throughput to as much as a million transactions per second (TPS) in the future.\n\nYakovenko, responding to Polynya’s specific critique, argued the natural growth in computing power coupled with falling costs as hardware becomes commoditized will handle Solana’s needs with aplomb.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nPolynya’s essay also advocates for advanced technologies like validity proofs and data availability sampling to address scaling demands, predicting “every single monolithic blockchain seeking scale will upgrade to tech like validity proofs and data availability sampling or be risk [obsolescence].”\n\nSolana developer Mert Mumtaz, CEO at Helius and co-host of Blockworks’ Lightspeed podcast, responded that Solana could embrace both vertical and horizontal scaling.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nPolynya further lamented the crypto industry’s disproportionate focus on infrastructure over user onboarding — and a dearth of applications with product-market fit — which Mumtaz derided as the pot calling the kettle black.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nIn response to criticism, Polynya published an addendum post on Sunday in which they acknowledge the tone of the original essay was a bit harsh, but noted “content only gets attention in crypto if it’s provocative.”\n\nMonolithic chains that integrate modular components, such as validity proofs and data availability sampling, would be a welcome change, Polynya argues, suggesting they would no longer be “monolithic” because “per my definition you no longer need all nodes to naïvely reprocess all transactions to verify integrity.”\n\nEndgame\n\nUltimately, this dispute revolves around the question of what is the modus operandi of using a blockchain?\n\n“The whole point of a public blockchain is lost if you are not resistant for the worst-case scenarios,” Polynya wrote. “[10,000 nodes] is not enough, and we should strive to have 100,000 nodes in different types of places across the world. We need nodes at homes, schools, government offices — in large cities, in villages, in Chile, in Papua New Guinea, and eventually in space.”\n\nSolana currently has between 2,000 and 3,000 nodes.\n\n“It’s perfectly fine to have a monolithic blockchain today, the technology to push past its crippling limitations did not exist 5 years ago,” Polynya concludes, with the caveat that the industry will “inevitably converge” on a design using validity proofs and data availability sampling.\n\n“This is the only currently known way for the blockchain world to achieve our endgame of global scale, all verified on our mobile phones.”\n\nPolynya further warns against continued “Ponzifying” of dapps. “As an industry, collectively, we must invest in consolidating our existing applications which have product-market fit, before traditional incumbents catch up and take away market share,” they said in Sunday’s denouement.\n\nUpdated, Nov. 20, 2023 at 9:52 am ET, with additional context.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain, news, and reflection analyst reports, it is clear that the market trend for ETH is currently bearish. The on-chain analysis indicates a potential downward movement in the near future, with the MACD signal consistently indicating a sell trend. The news analysis highlights the mixed performance of Solana-related tokens and the challenges faced by Solana in terms of competition with Ethereum. The reflection report emphasizes the importance of prioritizing assets with bullish trends and effective risk management to maximize profits.

Considering all the information provided, it is evident that a slightly conservative trading approach focusing on long-term growth opportunities and effective risk management is warranted. While short-term gains may be possible, the overall market trend for ETH appears to be bearish, and it is crucial to remain cautious of potential downward movements.

Therefore, I would recommend taking a conservative approach and considering selling ETH in the current market conditions. My trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.7, reflecting a moderate level of confidence in the bearish market trend and the strategic decision to manage risk appropriately for long-term profitability.

The data indicates a downward trend in open prices, total transactions, and successful transactions, along with a consistent sell signal from the MACD indicator. This suggests caution is advised for investors trading ETH.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights a potential shift in sentiment towards Solana (SOL) due to positive social media sentiment, strong network performance, and growing interest and adoption in the Solana ecosystem. This indicates a short-term correction in SOL price followed by a potential bullish trend, especially if the network continues to attract new users and demonstrate strong performance.

Reflecting on the recent trading performance, it is evident that prioritizing assets with bullish trends, like Solana, has been more successful compared to holding onto assets like ETH during bearish market conditions. It is crucial to continue monitoring technical indicators and staying updated on news reports to capitalize on profitable opportunities.

In conclusion, the market trend appears to favor assets like Solana over ETH in the long term. Therefore, a slightly conservative trading approach focusing on effective risk management and long-term growth opportunities is recommended to maximize profits and mitigate potential losses in the volatile cryptocurrency market.

*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the reports provided by the on-chain analyst, news analyst, and reflection analyst, it is evident that the overall market trend for ETH is bearish in the short term. The on-chain data indicates a downward trend in ETH with a recent buy signal potentially signaling a short-term uptrend. However, the news analyst report highlights increased volatility and regulatory scrutiny in the market, which could impact the performance of cryptocurrencies, including ETH. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of prioritizing assets with bullish trends like Solana for successful trading strategies.

Considering the information from all three analysts, it is clear that a slightly conservative trading approach focused on long-term growth opportunities and effective risk management is warranted to maximize profits and mitigate potential losses in the volatile market. While there may be short-term opportunities for gains in ETH, the overall market conditions suggest a cautious approach.

Therefore, I would take a slightly conservative approach and assign a trading action of 0.3, indicating moderate confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately for long-term growth.

REASONING:
Based on the given reports, it is clear that the on-chain analysis for ETH indicates a downward trend with decreasing market activity and sell signals in the MACD indicator. In contrast, the news analyst report highlights a bullish trend for Solana, with positive market sentiment, institutional interest, and strong tokenomics driving its growth. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of prioritizing assets with bullish trends like Solana over bearish assets like ETH for maximizing profits and managing risk effectively in the volatile cryptocurrency market.

Considering the current market conditions and the potential for further decline in ETH, it is advisable to adopt a slightly conservative trading approach and explore more profitable opportunities in assets with bullish trends like Solana. Long-term strategies focused on effective risk management and capitalizing on profitable opportunities are crucial for maximizing overall profit in the cryptocurrency market.

Therefore, based on the synthesized reports and the emphasis on long-term strategies, I would take a trading action with a confidence level of 0.5, indicating a neutral stance in the market to manage risk appropriately and potentially explore more profitable opportunities in assets like Solana.
ACTION:

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the data indicates a bearish trend for ETH, with the MACD signal consistently showing a sell indication. This suggests that the price of ETH may continue to decrease in the near future. Additionally, the news analyst report highlights a positive overall market trend, with institutional interest in altcoins and potential utility for meme coins like BONK. However, the reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of prioritizing assets with bullish trends, such as Solana, over bearish assets like ETH for maximizing profits.

Taking all reports into consideration, it is evident that while the overall market trend may be positive, the specific data for ETH points towards a bearish outlook. Therefore, a slightly conservative trading approach focusing on long-term growth opportunities and effective risk management is recommended to capitalize on profitable opportunities and mitigate potential losses in the volatile cryptocurrency market.

Given the bearish trend for ETH and the positive market sentiment towards altcoins like Solana, I would recommend selling ETH with a confidence level of -0.7 to manage risk appropriately and potentially capitalize on more profitable opportunities in the market.

Understanding this offers competitive advantages in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nWith that in mind, Finbold looked at Solana (SOL) tokenomics from a different perspective. Public market data from leading indexes can demonstrate the effects of an increased supply inflation. It is possible to calculate the exact price SOL would trade if it ever hits the all-time high market cap.\n\nA token needs more demand to keep its same value, facing an inflationary supply. These two factors influence whether a cryptocurrency’s price rises or falls. Each cryptocurrency, including Solana, has its unique ‘tokenomics’ structure.\n\nSolana had an all-time high market cap of $80.965 billion on November 8, 2021, according to TradingView’s CRYPTOCAP index.\n\nMeanwhile, the token traded for as high as $260.06 two days before, as registered by CoinMarketCap. An inverse calculation suggests a circulating supply of around 311.332 million SOL at that time.\n\nCRYPTOCAP – SOL daily market capitalization. Source: TradingView\n\nSolana supply inflation and its economic effects\n\nLet’s explore SOL’s supply inflation and its economic implications. As of this writing, Solana has a circulating supply of 423.139 million SOL. This results in a supply inflation of 111.807 million SOL (36%) in two years, or around 18% a year — higher than XRP’s yearly inflation.\n\nSolana supply. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nThe price projection also shows the massive economic effects of this inflation. In case the leading Ethereum competitor reaches its highest speculative demand of $80.965 billion market cap, SOL would trade at a proportionally lower price than the corresponding all-time high.\n\nConsidering the circulating supply on November 23, Solana would be priced at $191.34 per token at its highest capitalization. Interestingly, a loss of $68.72 (26.4%) from the previous price of $260.06 in 2021.\n\nHowever, this still indicates a potential 235% increase from the current price of $57.08.\n\nIt is important to understand that the forecast requires the same demand as 2021 for Solana. In this context, there are no guarantees that this demand will ever be seen again. On the other hand, it is also possible that a higher demand surges in the following years.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

The recent bullish outlook took another significant setback amid the developments at the largest exchange, Binance.\n\nAs reported, the former CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao resigned on Tuesday, paving the way for Richard Teng following the firm’s $4.3 billion settlement agreement with the US Department of Justice (DoJ).\n\nadvertisement\n\nCZ, as he is commonly referred to in the crypto world, resigned and on top of that pleaded guilty to breaking US anti-money laundering rules. He will no longer hold any executive positions at the company but was allowed to keep his stake.\n\nDue to the uncertainty in the market, Solana price extended the correction to test the support at $54. If successfully tested and a rebound follows, there is a high probability that SOL will make a bigger breakout.\n\nRecommended for you: Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH Resilient Above $2k After Fed Minutes, Is The Bull Run Intact?\n\nSolana Price Prediction: SOL Prepares For Falling Wedge Breakout\n\nOn top of the immediate support at $54, Solana holds between the 100 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (blue) and the 50 EMA (red). Consolidation is expected to take place within this range, with movement above the resistance at $56.58 likely to lead to another 17% breakout to $66.\n\nFalling wedges are bullish patterns that allow an asset to consolidate before resuming the uptrend. With the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator about to send a buy signal, traders can consider preparing to long SOL.\n\nTraders like @CryptoBusy believe that Solana could provide more opportunities to profit. This means that those interested in short-term gains should DCA as long as support at $54 holds. While a recovery above $60 to $70 could follow, gains past $70 would be a bonus.\n\n$SOL trade quick take profit has been activated! ✅ Shared this 24 hours ago. 💰 Looks like the market just wants us to profit, then it bounces back up from the support!

The RSI, now with a strength of 73, has corrected from highs around 83.\n\nIf this pullback continues, Solana may not be able to immediately resume the uptrend.

For instance, the fees recorded on 22nd November were $131,100.\n\nA few days before that, on 14th November in particular, Solana’s total fees were $99,724.\n\nMore fees, no downside\n\nSolana fees are set by the network, and it depends on congestion and historical throughput. About 50% of each transaction fee is burned while the rest goes to the validators processing the transactions.\n\nDespite having cheaper transaction fees compared to Ethereum, the hike in the amount means that there has been a lot of activity on the Solana network.\n\nThis assumption was confirmed by the number of daily active users, which increased by 132$ within the same period the fees climbed.\n\nWith respect to the SOL price, the broader market recovery helped it reclaim $58.16 in the last 24 hours. But before the hike, MS2 Capital mentioned that the$57.55 level could be decisive for SOL.\n\nAccording to the web3 venture accelerator, Low-Frequency Trading (LFT) could spell doom for the token, with a possible drop to $46.48.

Furthermore, the SOL/USD 4-hour chart buying pressure has been dominating the scenes since 22nd November.\n\nAlso, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) was 54.54. RSI reading above 50 is a sign that SOL’s uptrend could continue.\n\nHowever, the potential price increase would depend on increasing buying momentum.\n\nShould the RSI reading continue to rise, then SOL may retest $62. At the time of writing, the Aroon Up (orange) was 85.71% while the Aroon Down (blue) was 42.86%.\n\nThis is a sign that a new uptrend could be underway, and if the Aroon Down falls below 30%, it would confirm that bias.\n\nBut that would only be the case as long as the Aroon Up remains above 70%.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the data indicates a bearish trend for ETH, with the MACD signal consistently showing a sell indication. This suggests that the price of ETH may continue to decrease in the near future. Additionally, the news analyst report highlights a positive overall market trend, with institutional interest in altcoins and potential utility for meme coins like BONK. However, the reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of prioritizing assets with bullish trends, such as Solana, over bearish assets like ETH for maximizing profits.

Taking all reports into consideration, it is evident that while the overall market trend may be positive, the specific data for ETH points towards a bearish outlook. Therefore, a slightly conservative trading approach focusing on long-term growth opportunities and effective risk management is recommended to capitalize on profitable opportunities and mitigate potential losses in the volatile cryptocurrency market.

Given the bearish trend for ETH and the positive market sentiment towards altcoins like Solana, I would recommend selling ETH with a confidence level of -0.7 to manage risk appropriately and potentially capitalize on more profitable opportunities in the market.
ACTION:
-0.7
DAILY RETURN:
-0.020569900954012788
REASONING:
Based on the reports provided by the on-chain analyst, news analyst, and reflection analyst, it is evident that the overall market trend for ETH is bearish in the short term. The on-chain data indicates a downward trend in ETH with a recent buy signal potentially signaling a short-term uptrend. However, the news analyst report highlights increased volatility and regulatory scrutiny in the market, which could impact the performance of cryptocurrencies, including ETH. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of prioritizing assets with bullish trends like Solana for successful trading strategies.

Considering the information from all three analysts, it is clear that a slightly conservative trading approach focused on long-term growth opportunities and effective risk management is warranted to maximize profits and mitigate potential losses in the volatile market. While there may be short-term opportunities for gains in ETH, the overall market conditions suggest a cautious approach.

Therefore, I would take a slightly conservative approach and assign a trading action of 0.3, indicating moderate confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately for long-term growth.
ACTION:
0.3
DAILY RETURN:
0.04740707091491547
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain, news, and reflection analyst reports, it is clear that the market sentiment for ETH is uncertain, with a potential shift towards a bullish trend indicated by the MACD signal. On the other hand, Solana (SOL) is showing positive signs of growth with various factors contributing to its potential rise in value.

Considering the successful strategy of prioritizing assets with bullish trends like Solana over bearish assets like ETH for maximizing profits, it is advisable to adopt a slightly conservative trading approach focused on long-term growth and effective risk management. This approach will help capitalize on profitable opportunities while navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market successfully.

Therefore, my trading action would be to buy ETH with a confidence level of 0.3. This decision reflects a cautious approach, acknowledging the uncertain market trend for ETH but also considering the potential for a bullish reversal indicated by the MACD signal. By balancing short-term gains with long-term growth strategies, I aim to maximize overall profit while managing risk effectively.

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nMarket analysts are closely monitoring the Solana (SOL) price chart for signs of the infamous "Head and Shoulders" (H&S) pattern, often considered a precursor to a bearish downturn. Upon initial inspection, the current chart does not showcase the definitive structure of a typical H&S pattern.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCharacterized by three distinct speaks — the left shoulder, the central peak (head), and the right shoulder, separated by valleys (troughs) — an H&S formation is anchored by the "neckline," drawn across the lowest points of the troughs, serving as a pivotal support line. Solana\'s recent price movement on the Kucoin exchange, however, reveals the absence of this pattern, displaying instead a consistent upward trend punctuated by regular corrections.\n\nThe threat of a trend reversal, nonetheless, casts a long shadow. The future establishment of an H&S pattern on the Solana chart would mark a significant change from a bullish to a bearish market outlook. The formation\'s completion, with the right shoulder\'s appearance, would indicate a weakening in the buying force, potentially setting the stage for a change in the asset\'s trajectory.\n\nWavelike movement of Solana\n\nDelving into Solana\'s movements with the Elliott Wave theory provides a more detailed perspective. This theory suggests that market prices oscillate in a predictable five-wave sequence, comprising three "motive" waves and two "corrective" waves. The current pattern on Solana\'s chart may suggest it is at the end of such a sequence, with the final "motive" wave possibly reaching its peak recently. What follows could be a corrective pattern, which might be misinterpreted as an H&S formation.\n\nThe full formation of an H&S pattern would carry weighty consequences for Solana\'s position on the market. A drop beneath the neckline would validate the bearish pattern, potentially initiating a wave of sell-offs as market participants rush to minimize losses or profit from the downward movement. Such a scenario would indicate the depletion of the bullish energy that has propelled SOL to its current levels, potentially leading to a new bearish cycle.'}, {'id': 1, 'time': 'Fri, 24 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Injective launches bridge, places Solana users at the head - AMBCrypto English', 'content': 'Injective has integrated SPL tokens to allow bridging from Solana.\n\nSOL’s volume decreased, while INJ’s price has the potential to increase.\n\nCross-chain bridging platform Injective [INJ] announced that it has integrated tokens developed under the Solana Program Library (SPL). The project made the update known on the 22nd of November, via a post on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nSPL tokens are similar to Ethereum’s [ETH] ERC-20 tokens. But this time, the tokens are created and managed under the Solana network while following specific standards for transactions.\n\nInjective and Solana: A perfect match?\n\nAccording to Injective, these Solana [SOL] tokens can be bridged using the Injective Hub, a platform primarily designed to ease cross-network transactions on the blockchain. One SPL token that Injective has put at the forefront of the integration is Pyth Network [PYTH].\n\n🌉 Injective has officially integrated SPL tokens. Now assets from @solana such as $PYTH can seamlessly be accessed via the Injective Hub and Bridge. pic.twitter.com/Tf9k8LFmb8 — Injective 🥷 (@Injective_) November 22, 2023\n\nAMBCrypto had recently reported about PYTH, explaining how the project rewarded some of its early users, and the impact on the price action. Considering Pyth Network’s real-time blockchain feed ability, its integration with Injective means the project might do it faster.\n\nAlso, this integration has the capacity to bring in more users to Solana and the Injective protocol. But at the time of writing, Injective’s network growth has tumbled. Network growth shows the number of new addresses actively making transfers on a protocol.\n\nAn increase in the metric suggests a hike in traction. On the contrary, a decrease in the metric means adoption has declined. So, in Injective’s case, new addresses have steered clear of participating in transfers on the network.\n\nTransactions fall but INJ tilts bullish\n\nLike Injective, Solana has experienced a drop in transactions on the network. This was confirmed by an overview of the SOL volume using Sentiment. As shown above, SOL’s volume was down to 1.83 billion.\n\nThe decrease in volume signals a downward shift in the amount of SOL tokens involved in transactions compared to the last few days. In terms of the price action, INJ was trading at $15.84. This was after it gained 3.08% in the last 24 hours.\n\nSOL, on the other hand, exchanged hands at $54.76, thanks to a 5.62% hike within the same timeframe. Meanwhile, INJ’s 24-hour increase was not enough to change the market sentiment to a solid bullish position.\n\nAccording to AMBCrypto’s analysis of Quantify Crypto’s data, INJ’s technical score was 50.7. This reading means that most market participants were not sure about the particular direction the token would head next.\n\nRealistic or not, here’s INJ’s market cap in SOL’s terms\n\nHence, a large size of the market has remained on the sidelines.\n\nHowever, the Quantify Crypt Trend metric revealed that INJ has a higher chance of being bullish over the next few days. But this projected movement will only happen if the accumulation of the token begins to rise.'}, {'id': 0, 'time': 'Fri, 24 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Should You Buy Solana While It's Below $60? - The Motley Fool", 'content': "Solana is hot, but this may be a time for caution.\n\nSolana (SOL 1.02%) is a far cry from where it was in late 2021, when its value peaked at over $250 per token. But the blockchain itself is stronger than ever.\n\nTransactions are fast on Solana, frequent users stayed during the market downturn, and corporations are now starting to take developing on Solana seriously. After a run-up over the last few months, where the price per token nearly tripled in two short months, is Solana worth buying as long as it's under $60?\n\nLet's find out.\n\nSolana's technical advantages over other blockchains\n\nSolana has always been one of the fastest blockchains. It was built with speed and low cost in mind, and we are seeing that in reality. On-chain data shows that transactions per second (including voting transactions) hover between 4,000 and 5,000 per second. Excluding nonvoting transactions, there are as many as 600 transactions per second, and that's not the limit of the blockchain's capability.\n\nCost per transaction is so close to zero that it almost doesn't make sense to talk about. According to Solana Compass, in the past 24 hours, the average fee for a transaction was about $0.003. That's a fraction of what a higher-priced blockchain like Ethereum (ETH 2.36%) or even Ethereum's Layer 2 blockchains, or scaling blockchains built on top of Ethereum, cost. Those pennies per transaction can add up in a hurry if you execute a lot of transactions.\n\nAccording to The Block, there are about 350,000 active wallets on the Solana network, similar to Ethereum's 365,000 addresses. So this is one of the most active blockchains in the world.\n\nBig companies are paying attention to Solana\n\nOne of the more prominent signs of adoption that investors and traders should be looking for is companies starting to use the blockchain as parts of their business. In the case of Solana, the blockchain is getting a lot of attention from big companies.\n\nVisa is beginning to use Solana as part of its settlement layer for transactions, while Shopify and MercadoLibre are using it as a way to pay for transactions in their retail systems. These are all payment services, and the speed and low cost of Solana is an attractive use case for them. Low transaction fees and fast settlement of payments -- that's just what the doctor ordered for an efficient payment option on a high-volume shopping platform.\n\nThis is just an example of companies using Solana for some kind of technical use, and as the blockchain matures and becomes more reliable, I think we will see even more companies use it.\n\nSo, is Solana a buy now?\n\nWidespread adoption of the Solana blockchain is great, but does that mean the token will go up in value?\n\nFor now, the answer appears to be yes, but I'm not sure whether or not that will be the case long term. The corporate money transfer use cases I highlighted are primarily using USDC tokens, a U.S. dollar stablecoin that operates on Solana and other blockchains. The coin started out on the Ethereum chain but now maintains addresses in dozens of different blockchain networks. So, fees need to be paid for using Solana tokens, but that doesn't mean the Solana token will be used to buy items in the future.\n\nI think it's more likely that tokens like stablecoins become the most common token used on Solana, rather than the Solana token itself.\n\nThat's why I'm holding, but not buying, more Solana at the moment. I don't see a lot of upside from here from the Solana cryptocurrency, even if the blockchain itself thrives."}, {'id': 8, 'time': 'Fri, 24 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Solana Price Prediction as SOL Gains 6.65% in Third Week of November – Will the Bullish Momentum Continue? - Cryptonews', 'content': 'Solana Price Prediction as SOL Gains 6.65% in Third Week of November – Will the Bullish Momentum Continue?\n\nThe Solana price has recorded a 1% gain in the past 24 hours, in line with a similar return for the market as a whole today.\n\nAt $58.32, SOL has now risen by just over 6% in the past week, with the altcoin also posting an 18% gain in a fortnight and a very impressive 81% jump in the last 30 days.\n\nThis makes SOL the best-performing top-20 token across these periods, with available data suggesting that institutions and funds are becoming more interested in the token.\n\nAs such, it’s likely to continue rising over the next weeks, possibly seeing out the year with a strong bull rally.\n\nSolana Price Prediction as SOL Gains 6.65% in Third Week of November – Will the Bullish Momentum Continue?\n\n\n\nBased on an examination of SOL’s indicators and chart, the altcoin continues to find itself in good form, with its momentum continuing.\n\nIts 30-day average (yellow) is still rising further above its 200-day (blue), a sign that its ongoing growth spurt still isn’t likely to come to an end very soon.\n\nAdditionally, SOL’s RSI has one again climbed above 60, another indicator of good buying pressure that has space left to intensify.\n\nOther positive signals include its trading volume, which remains at around $1 billion, way above the $150 million levels it registered in August and September.\n\nSuch volumes highlight the fact that interest in SOL continues to be strong, with a whale alert today revealing that a large trader has transferred around $25 million in SOL away from Kraken.\n\nThis is a bullish sign, insofar as it indicates that the token remains in an accumulation phase, with more price increases on the cards.\n\nIndeed, as we’ve written before, SOL is currently the most popular altcoin in terms of fund inflows, even outperforming Ethereum (ETH).\n\nIt therefore makes sense to suggest that further market-wide rallies will continue to be led by Solana, which has had an excellent 2023.\n\nThis is evident in its rising total value locked in, as well as in the 100% continuous uptime it has had since the start of the year.\n\nAs such, the Solana price will continue rising in the coming weeks, potentially reaching $80 by 2024.\n\nNew High-Potential Altcoins\n\n\n\nThe only issue with SOL is that it’s so hot at the moment that it’s in danger of becoming too hot, meaning that it may slow down from here on out.\n\nTraders wary of this possibility may be inclined to invest in newer alts, especially younger alts which still have their first breakout rallies to look forwards to.\n\nThis includes such a token as Bitcoin ETF Token (BTCETF), an ERC-20 cryptocurrency that has raised over $1.5 million in its increasingly successful presale.\n\n🚀 Embracing the future of #Crypto with #BTCETF! As an ERC-20 token on #Ethereum, #BitcoinETF anticipates the imminent #Bitcoin ETFs. Positioned to leverage their approval, this visionary project offers a gateway to the evolving crypto world. 💡 pic.twitter.com/eiMUbIfXeD — BTCETF_Token (@BTCETF_Token) November 23, 2023\n\nBitcoin ETF Token has been winning over investors by virtue of its novel tokenomics, which are linked to Bitcoin and the progress of Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nIt will burn 25% of its total max supply over time, destroying a 5% tranche whenever Bitcoin reaches a certain milestone.\n\nThe cryptocurrency will burn its first 5% when the SEC approves a spot-based Bitcoin ETF for the first ever time.\n\nThis burn tax will further reduce its supply, with the final 5% block set for burning when BTC reaches a price of $100,000.\n\nAll of this makes Bitcoin ETF Token one of the most aggressively deflationary tokens in the market, which perhaps explains why investors are flocking to its sale.\n\nNew investors can join the sale at the official Bitcoin ETF Token website, where they can buy BTCETF by connecting their crypto wallets and using either ETH, USDT. BNB or fiat currency..\n\nIts presale price is currently $0.0058, yet this will rise in just under four days, while it could rally massively once it lists on exchanges after the sale ends.\n\nVisit Bitcoin ETF Token Now\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto is a high-risk asset class.

Cryptocurrency investors can benefit from finding asymmetries and positioning accordingly.\n\nInterestingly, Avalanche (AVAX) has one of the largest Total Value Locked (TVL) in DeFi, with a suggested asymmetry to its market capitalization. In particular, it gets stronger when comparing Solana’s (SOL) higher market cap and lower TVL.\n\nIt is important to understand that value investing involves many nuances, and investors must consider multiple factors when fundamentally evaluating projects. However, Finbold picked TVL as a benchmark to provide insights on a possible value asymmetry in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nIn this context, TheCoinPerspective shows that AVAX would be priced at $66.71 if Avalanche had Solana’s $24.4 billion market capitalization. This would result in an upside of 222%, considering a price of $20.75 per AVAX by press time.\n\nAvalanche (AVAX) vs. Solana (SOL) market cap. Source: TheCoinPerspective\n\nAvalanche and Solana’s TVL to measure market cap\n\nThe two competitors are aiming to meet a similar demand for layer-1 blockchains to Decentralized Apps (DApps), Decentralized Finance, and Web3. Therefore, we can use the total value locked in Avalanche and Solana to spot potential asymmetries on the market cap.\n\nSolana’s TVL surged by 73.19% in one month to $620.2 million, giving it the 8th highest value, according to DefiLlama. Notably, Avalanche still has a higher $652.17 million TVL for a smaller monthly growth of 22.37%.\n\nThis means that investors are locking $32 million more value in the Avalanche ecosystem of 346 protocols than in Solana’s 115.\n\nTotal value locked for each chain. Source: DefiLlama\n\nFrom another perspective, AVAX has $16.81 billion less capitalization than SOL, with a $7.59 billion market cap for the former. Essentially, Avalanche has an 11.75 market cap for each TVL, while Solana has 39.88 MCap/TVL.

At the time of writing, Solana is trading at a price of $58.21, up 2.36% in the past 24 hours. The core Solana metrics are bullish and suggest recapturing the $60 price level is imminent in the near term.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince Solana was rejuvenated this year, its price has been on a meteoric rise that saw it push past the psychologically important threshold at $60 on Nov. 15. Bears did not allow Solana to form a support above this threshold, and as such, it lost its grip and retraced back to a low of $51.6 on Nov. 22.\n\nThe attempt to reclaim $60 has become a key hurdle that SOL bulls have been unable to work their way past in recent times. With the current outlook and resolve as showcased in the 6.64% jump in trading volume to $1,374,937,101, a consistent increase in the trading volume is a sign retail investors are flooding the market. Notably, their presence can help stabilize the price as SOL makes an attempt to reclaim its lost mandate.\n\nSolana (SOL) price riding on history\n\nWhile in the immediate term, the $60 price target may seem an ambitious level to breach, it is worth noting that Solana has traded at a level far higher than this in the past. Prior to the FTX collapse of 2022, Solana traded at an all-time high (ATH) of $260. This implies that the ultimate goal is to retest this ATH by first conquering as many immediate price levels as possible.\n\nSolana is no longer tied to the pangs or negative impacts of the FTX implosion, and though the bankrupt exchange continues to sell off the coin in its liquidation spree, Solana has made a crucial anchor that naturally attracts other liquidity to it.'}, {'id': 4, 'time': 'Sat, 25 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Home for the holidays with the Gothard Sisters | HeraldNet.com - The Daily Herald', 'content': 'The Edmonds trio brings tidings of Celtic comfort and joy with a new Christmas album and concert\n\nSisters Greta, Willow and Solana Gothard have been playing music together since childhood, expanding from early violin lessons to playing guitar, mandolin, djembe, bodhran and more alongside vocal harmonies. (Ruth H Photography)\n\nBy Sara Bruestle / Special to The Herald\n\nThe Gothard Sisters are back home in Edmonds for their annual Celtic-inspired Christmas concert — this time with a new Christmas album.\n\nSisters Greta, 36, Willow, 34, and Solana, 28, are award-winning singer-songwriters, talented multi-instrumentalists and championship Irish dancers with an international following.\n\nThe world-traveling trio has played over 2,000 live shows around the globe, including performing aboard seven Disney cruises and two tours in Japan.\n\nToday, they perform three annual U.S. tours: a St. Patrick’s Day tour, a summer tour and a Christmas tour.\n\nThe Gothard Sisters will play their not-to-be-missed Christmas show Dec. 7 at the Edmonds Center for the Arts.\n\nThe threesome play a festive mix of Christmas carols and Celtic tunes, both originals and covers. They switch instruments often, break out into Irish dance and even have the audience do a sing-along or two. As is tradition, they’ll invite a local Irish dance school to perform with them on stage.\n\n“We love Christmas,” Greta Gothard said. “We love all the traditions that go along with it, the festive spirit in the wintertime, that the holiday is just so full of joy and light.”\n\n“A Celtic Christmas,” to be released on Nov. 10, is a 12-track recording featuring “Angels We Have Heard on High,” “O Come, O Come, Emmanuel,” “I Saw Three Ships,” “Away in a Manger” and “Deck the Halls.”\n\nThe new album “A Celtic Christmas” is the sisters’ 10th, featuring a selection of traditional carols rendered in the band’s signature, ethereal style. They’ll perform live Dec. 7 in Edmonds. (Knecht Creative)\n\nThe Gothard Sisters have put out 10 albums in all — including three other Christmas recordings — in their 14 years performing, touring and writing as a Celtic-folk trio. “A Celtic Christmas” is the first Christmas album they’ve recorded and produced on their own.\n\n“We’ve had more modern Christmas songs on our previous albums — this one is entirely much older,” Willow Gothard said, adding that some of the carols are literally ancient. “Except for one original tune. It’s instrumental and is called ‘Winterberry Set.’’’\n\nThis new recording is their take on Christmas carols that were penned hundreds if not thousands of years ago, many of them from the Celtic nations: Brittany, Cornwall, Ireland, Isle of Man, Scotland and Wales.\n\n“We picked 12 tunes from those regions from a long time ago and reinvented them in Gothard Sisters’ style,” Greta Gothard said, adding that their family heritage is “a little bit” Irish and Scottish. “We want them to sound new and fresh, like you’re hearing them again for the first time.”\n\nThe sisters say that the tracks on “A Celtic Christmas” are both festive and restful.\n\nSome songs are cheerful, great to play while you’re shopping or decorating, while others are cozy, meant to be listened to as you wrap presents or sit by the window with a warm cup.\n\n“When I turn on music during the holidays, it’s like I want something to just center me,” Solana Gothard said. “It’s like a little oasis in the middle of all the crazy busyness going on. I can focus on this magical moment right here, right now. We want our music to help with that.”\n\nLayers of sound\n\nThe Gothard Sisters fell in love with Celtic music while listening to National Public Radio’s “The Thistle and Shamrock” on family road trips over Snoqualmie Pass. The popular Sunday radio program, named after the national emblems of Scotland and Ireland, specializes in Celtic music.\n\nThe trio also danced to Celtic music competitively for many years. They competed in the World Irish Dancing Championships four times. Of note, Greta and Willow placed second with Seattle’s Comerford School of Irish Dance team in 2007.\n\nAll three sisters play the violin. Greta asked for lessons when she was 5 because a concert violinist had brought her to tears. After that, Willow and Solana both wanted to learn violin, too. Willow picked it up at 5; Solana couldn’t wait that long, so she started when she was 3.\n\nThe Gothards began their careers by playing classical violin for tips at the Edmonds Farmers Market.\n\nThree years later, they traded classical for Celtic. Studying Irish dance, performing to Celtic tunes and watching shows like “Riverdance” and “Lord of the Dance” had them thinking that they should play it too.\n\nAfter forming their Celtic band in 2009, the sisters started adding layers to their sound. All together, they now play seven different instruments: violin, guitar, mandolin, bodhran, ukulele, djembe and the penny whistle. Greta and Willow sing backup vocals, while Solana is the lead singer.\n\n(In “A Celtic Christmas,” they also a...'}]

After reviewing the on-chain, news, and reflection analyst reports, it is clear that the market sentiment for ETH is uncertain, with a potential shift towards a bullish trend indicated by the MACD signal. On the other hand, Solana (SOL) is showing positive signs of growth with various factors contributing to its potential rise in value.

According to the exchange, the reason had to do with its latest review of the assets with no elaboration made. Over the period, Solana was in a bearish run as the asset was still struggling from the FTX failure.\n\nIn a surprise turn of events, SOL has made a 180 percent surge in the last three months to trade at $57.96, adding $37.30 to its previous price. In the last 30 days, SOL has surged by 81 percent but has declined by 0.31 percent in the last 24 hours. With this incredible performance, a relist of the asset on Robinhood could be a catalyst for a bullish continuation. Analysts listed two main reasons that could trigger a bull run when Robinhood relists SOL.\n\nThe first is the removal of regulatory uncertainties. The reason for the delisting of Solana was attributed by some crypto experts to the regulatory concerns from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It can be recalled that the SEC listed Solana as one of the 12 assets believed to be securities in the lawsuit against Binance. The decision, is, therefore, associated with an abundance of caution according to some crypto experts. Relisting would therefore reduce the fears surrounding the possible crackdown on the asset and could trigger another bull run.\n\nMore on the Solana Price Analysis\n\nAnother reason why this could be a piece of good news for existing investors is the potential returns of retail investors. Currently, Robinhood provides a real-time market update on Solana but remains untradable. When things change, retail investors can easily trade in the asset. The exchange has more than 10 million monthly active users, and the relisting decision could attract millions of dollars into the ecosystem.\n\nOne interesting observation of Robinhood’s users is that most of them are young. According to research, young investors are mostly attracted by tech stocks and cryptocurrencies. Recently, Ark Invest’s CEO Cathie Wood lauded Solana, calling it faster and more effective.\n\nSolana is doing a really good job. If you look at Ethereum it was faster and cheaper than Bitcoin in the day. Solana is faster and more cost-effective than Ethereum.\n\nFrom the current price, Nathan Jacobs, Senior Researcher at The Money Mongers has predicted that Solana could surge to between $250 and $300 by early 2024.\n\nIf Solana stays on its hot streak and dodges tech troubles, I reckon it could hit between $250 to $300 when 2024 rolls in. Its appeal to the [decentralized finance (DeFi)]and [non-fungible token (NFT)] scenes is a huge plus, given its tech chops with fast and cheap transactions.\n\nDerek Rodriguez, founder and CEO of Gridlock, has also predicted that Solana would continue its upward surge to hit a resistance level at $100 around January and February. Also, he predicted that Solana could plummet to around $60, and then take another surge to hit $200 in late 2024.\n\nRecommended for you:'}]

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is experiencing fluctuations with a mix of buy and sell signals, indicating some volatility. However, recent buy signals suggest a potential upward trend. The news analyst report on Solana (SOL) presents a cautiously optimistic outlook, with potential for growth but also risks to consider. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of prioritizing assets with bullish trends and effective risk management in navigating the volatile market successfully.

Considering the information from the reports, it is evident that a slightly conservative trading approach focused on long-term growth opportunities and effective risk management is warranted. While short-term gains may be possible, the emphasis should be on capitalizing on profitable opportunities while mitigating potential losses.

Therefore, my trading action would be to buy ETH with a confidence level of 0.6.

*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that ETH has been on a consistent uptrend with positive indicators such as increasing open prices, high total transactions, and successful transactions, along with a buy indication from the MACD signal. This suggests a bullish trend for ETH in the near future.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights some uncertainty in the broader cryptocurrency market, including a slight downturn and potential movements in Solana influenced by both ecosystem growth and market conditions. This indicates a more cautious approach may be necessary when considering trading actions.

In reflection of my recent trading performance and the synthesized reports, it is evident that a slightly conservative trading approach focusing on assets with strong fundamentals like ETH is key to maximizing profits and managing risks effectively in the volatile cryptocurrency market. Therefore, a long-term strategy that considers both bullish trends and market uncertainties is crucial for sustainable profitability.

Considering the overall market trend and the need for a slightly conservative approach, I would take a trading action of 0.5, reflecting moderate confidence in the bullish trend of ETH while also acknowledging the potential market uncertainties. This decision aims to balance the potential for growth with the need to manage risks appropriately in the current market conditions.

This ascent has propelled Solana to the 8th spot among the top 10 performing DeFi chains, accompanied by an 8% growth over the past week.\n\nThe growth reflects a year-long positive trajectory for Solana’s DeFi ecosystem, whose TVL had grown by 204% on the year-to-date metrics, from the $210.47 million recorded on Jan. 1 to its current position.\n\nHowever, despite this growth, the TVL remains substantially lower than its all-time high of over $10 billion recorded in 2021.\n\nHigh network activity\n\nDeFillama data shows that decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume activity on Solana has been at its highest level for the first time since November last year, when the network began to suffer from exposure to the collapsed FTX exchange.\n\nData from Artemis further shows that the increasing DEX volume also coincides with Solana hitting a three-month high in daily transactions. On Nov. 24, the blockchain network’s daily transactions volume surged to 51.36 million.\n\nThese rising metrics corroborate a recent CryptoSlate Research report, which pointed out that the network saw a solid influx of new users and high network activity.\n\nAdditionally, the increased network activity denotes a rising influx of investors and a heightened interest in the Solana DeFi ecosystem. During the past year, the blockchain scored notable partnerships with traditional finance entities such as Visa, Shopify, and others, further bolstering its use and adoption.\n\nMentioned in this article'}, {'id': 6, 'time': 'Wed, 29 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Top Solana (SOL) Price Predictions: What to Look For in the Coming Months? - CryptoPotato', 'content': 'TL;DR\n\nSolana (SOL) has seen a recent surge, trading above $60 with significant gains in the last month, nearing its yearly high.\n\nAnalysts predict a bright future for SOL, with targets ranging from $63 in the short term to as high as $1,000, as suggested by Crypto King and Jacob Canfield.\n\nThere’s speculation about SOL potentially surpassing Ripple (XRP) in market capitalization, with factors like community sentiment and regulatory developments influencing this possibility.\n\nHow High Can SOL Spike?\n\nSolana’s native token – SOL – is once again among the top performers in the cryptocurrency market, with its price recently surging above $60 (per CoinGecko’s data). The coin’s valuation has jumped 9% in the past 24 hours and 75% in the last 30 days.\n\nDespite still being slightly below its yearly high of approximately $67 (reached in mid-November), some analysts have forecasted that the asset is on the verge of climbing fresh peaks. One individual who shares that thesis is the X (Twitter) user Crypto King.\n\nExpecting the token to rise to $63 in the short term, the analyst also thinks the asset is poised for a surge toward a new all-time high of as high as $300 in the long run.\n\nThe crypto trader Jacob Canfield has also previously outlined an optimistic future for SOL, envisioning its price to explode to a whopping $1,000. He also counseled people to diversify and invest in both Ethereum and Solana:\n\n“No reason not to have allocations to both. It’s like trying to bet on Microsoft or Google. Tesla or Ford. Just buy both.”\n\nCan SOL Flip XRP?\n\nSolana (SOL) is currently the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, while Ripple (XRP) is in the fifth spot. The rapid price increase of the former might have prompted some crypto participants to speculate whether it could surpass its rival next year.\n\nAccording to ChatGPT, such a flippening is not entirely out of the cards and depends on multiple crucial factors such as the overall sentiment across the community, investor sentiment, partnerships, and others.\n\nThe AI-powered language model estimated that potential regulatory developments could also play a major role.

As newly acquired tokens are injected across Solana, the resulting TVL infusion will help increase the valuation of the entire Solana ecosystem.\n\nThe arrival of airdrops on Solana may not allow TVL to outperform price, as the two are positively correlated metrics, but it should place upward pressure on both numbers and could be the force that actually allows SOL-denominated TVL to grow in 2024!\n\nDemonstrating the ability of airdrops to attract TVL is the abrupt rise of Blast, an L2 offering "points" to those who deposit funds into a multi-sig prior to the project\'s February mainnet launch. Despite launching last week and not having a product, Blast\'s TVL managed to briefly surpass that of Solana.\n\nBlast now has more TVL in a week than the most hyped VC chain in history after 4 years https://t.co/4Tr8YWhyp0 pic.twitter.com/ySyoLdEF7a — Evan Van Ness 🧉 (@evan_van_ness) November 28, 2023\n\nThe arrival of airdrops is a key component in kicking off a potential Solana supercycle and is one of the easiest ways to onboard users to the chain!\n\nUsers of EVM chains are eligible for the Pyth airdrop. To claim it, however, they had to download a Solana native wallet to receive their Solana native asset, which could then be used within Solana native DeFi protocols. EVM recipients of the PYTH airdrop may represent net new users for Solana!\n\nAirdropping tokens also helps get eyes on projects, and coverage of Solana airdrops alerts users and developers that cool applications exist on the chain. This goes a long way in representing Solana as a viable ecosystem and alternative to Ethereum.\n\n⏭️ Takeaways\n\nThe arrival of "Solana Stimmy Szn" may herald the rebirth of Solana\'s DeFi ecosystem, but this outcome is far from assured, and while top-tier projects may be gearing up for large airdrops, the number of successful and innovative Solana protocols that can airdrop tokens is few and far between.\n\nLiquidity remains on Ethereum, referenced by the ability of protocols like Blast to attract hundreds of millions in TVL with little more than a vague promise of an airdrop and questionable innovation, incentivizing developers to build there. As a result, Solana will be fighting an uphill battle for protocols, liquidity, and users.\n\nThanks to its low-fee environment, global state machine, and ability to provide consensus at the speed of light, Solana promises to unlock a new frontier of applications not possible on Ethereum; hopefully, they will come soon!\n\nWhile the hype cycle of airdrops and their resulting wealth effect will likely be enough to attract new ecosystem participants to Solana and bolster key stats, to realize success from airdrops, Solana must nurture its own DeFi ecosystem and have a wide array of protocols ready to airdrop tokens.\n\nPerhaps airdrops will be the fuel to incept another wave of Solana protocols; however, tragically, the current depth of tokenless protocols on the network of size is less than impressive, greatly diminishing the benefit that airdrops could have on the Solana ecosystem.'}, {'id': 3, 'time': 'Wed, 29 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Despite Massive Gains, Solana (SOL) Could Just be Getting Started - Nasdaq', 'content': 'Top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and Ethereum (ETH-USD) have bounced back in a big way in 2023, with year-to-date gains of 123% and 69%, respectively. Beyond the two largest cryptos, other assets like Solana (SOL-USD) have done even better. Solana is up 387% so far in 2023, but the party could just be getting started.\n\nI’m bullish on Solana’s long-term potential based on its impressive performance metrics, the explosive growth of usage and activity on the Solana blockchain, and its relatively low market cap versus its peer, Ethereum.\n\nStellar Metrics\n\nSolana is a proof-of-stake layer-1 blockchain, like Ethereum. To be fully transparent, I own both Solana and Ethereum, and I am bullish on both, so the following comparison between the two networks is simply meant to illustrate the potential value of Solana.\n\nEthereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, but Solana features several notable advantages from a user perspective. While Ethereum is averaging a throughput of under 30 transactions per second (TPS), Solana features an exponentially higher throughput of 65,000 transactions per second.\n\nThis high throughput leads to faster transaction times. Transactions on Solana are often completed in a matter of seconds, whereas transactions on Ethereum can take five minutes or more to process at times (the average is between 15 seconds to five minutes).\n\nMeanwhile, high transaction costs, or "gas fees," have been one of the main gripes Ethereum users have had about the network for a long time. At writing, Ethereum\'s gas fees have hit their highest levels in six months and are averaging over $30 per transaction, making it cumbersome and expensive to use the network for routine transactions.\n\nIn contrast, transactions on Solana cost less than a penny. This makes Solana an appealing option for users who want to make low-cost transactions. If you want to buy a nonfungible token (NFT) for $40 or send a friend $20, paying $30 in gas on Ethereum isn\'t practical, whereas a transaction fee of under a penny on Solana is hardly noticeable. These low costs could help Solana appeal to more users as cryptocurrency reaches wider adoption.\n\nThis massive throughput, low cost, and fast transaction time led Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) analysts to declare that Solana could be "the Visa (NYSE:V) of the digital asset ecosystem" earlier this year.\n\nWhile the Solana blockchain’s performance is impressive, it could get even better. Solana users are awaiting the launch of Firedancer, a new validator in development that will reportedly increase Solana’s throughput to a mind-blowing one million transactions per second.\n\nUsage Explodes\n\nThis positive user experience has led to an explosion in usage for Solana. Crypto publication The Defiant recently reported that “Solana is having its best month ever” in terms of trading volume and total value locked.\n\nVolume on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on Solana hit an all-time high of $5.1 billion in November, smashing the previous record of $2.8 billion last November.\n\nSolana’s total value locked (TVL) -- essentially a measure of how much value users have committed to or locked up in the network -- has jumped from $427 million at the start of November to $610 million currently, indicating growing confidence in the Solana network by crypto users.\n\nOn November 11th, the number of daily active users (DAUs) on Solana even surpassed those of the much larger Ethereum, with 356,300 users for the day versus 330,000 for Ethereum.\n\nIncreasing Collaborations and Partnerships\n\nAdditionally, Solana has made significant headway in terms of corporate partnerships and tie-ups with other crypto projects.\n\nIn August, Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) announced an integration with Solana Pay, which would make using Solana a new payment option on the platform. Then, as if that wasn’t enough, in September, Visa announced that it would use Solana to facilitate USDC (USDC-USD) stablecoin transactions.\n\nFurthermore, some interesting crypto projects, like Helium and Render (RNDR-USD), are migrating to Solana. Render, which seeks to provide decentralized GPU computing power for 3D content creation, migrated from Ethereum to Solana earlier in November. Render founder Jules Urbach said that Render made the move because of Solana’s “incredible transaction speeds, low costs, and commitment to web-scale architecture.”\n\nMeanwhile, Helium, which is focused on providing decentralized WiFi, made the move from its own layer-1 blockchain to Solana to free up its developers from having to focus on maintaining their own blockchain and leverage Solana\'s fast transaction times.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nSolana’s enormous throughput, fast transaction times, and minuscule transaction fees have attracted more users to the network. As a result, activity on the Solana blockchain is experiencing a Cambrian explosion, as seen in the significant increase in DEX volume, total value locked, and daily active users.\n\nNone of this is to say that Solana wi...'}]
