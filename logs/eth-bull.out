Its exit leaves only four other major relay players to handle most Ethereum blocks and raises concern of potential problems, ranging from the censorship of transactions to stealing of other key operators’ profits.'}, {'id': 7, 'time': 'Sat, 30 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Bitwise joins growing list of Ethereum ETF managers - CryptoSlate', 'content': 'Bitwise Asset Management announced the launch of two Ethereum-themed exchange-traded funds (ETFs), joining the growing list of asset managers looking to create Ethereum-based futures products after the SEC greenlit them.\n\nThe two funds will be called the Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH) and the Bitwise Bitcoin and Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF (BTOP). Bitwise said the launch of these ETFs will facilitate investor access to Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Ether futures and further expand regulated and trusted investment avenues in the crypto sector.\n\nEthereum futures ETFs\n\nBitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan noted the extensive portfolio opportunity Ethereum offers compared to Bitcoin, describing it as a blend of alternative and conventional growth investment. He added:\n\n“Some investors view Ethereum as an alternative, while others perceive it as a conventional growth investment, encompassing attributes of both.”\n\nThe launch comes as Ethereum continues to establish itself as a nexus of innovation and growth. It brings forth an ecosystem thriving with applications and developments, capturing the attention of millions of users and leading brands.\n\nBitwise CEO Hunter Horsley highlighted Ethereum’s dynamic growth and the momentum it’s gaining and said the ETFs are intended to be a gateway for investors to participate in Ethereum’s expanding landscape through regulated avenues that inspire confidence.\n\nBroader landscape\n\nThe commencement of trading for Bitwise’s ETFs is part of a larger trend, with numerous companies, including Invesco and Valkyrie, exploring Ethereum ETF offerings while awaiting approval for spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe decisions by the U.S. SEC on these applications are highly anticipated, with outcomes potentially being influenced by related developments such as the Grayscale lawsuit.\n\nThe crypto community is keenly observing what the SEC does, as approval decisions by the watchdog are poised to shape the trajectory of crypto investments in the U.S. for years to come.\n\nNotably, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart revealed that nine Ethereum Futures ETFs, including Bitwise’s, are set to receive expedited approval from the SEC for their launch on Monday, October 2, 2023.'}, {'id': 9, 'time': 'Sat, 30 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum Supply Is Starting to Grow Again as Gas Prices Plummet - Decrypt', 'content': "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nSupply dynamics in Ethereum are constantly being upended amid this year's dizzying drop in DeFi, NFT sales, and meme coin trading.\n\nDepending on which time frame you are looking at, Ethereum can be deflationary or inflationary: on a seven-day model, Ethereum becomes more scarce, whereas on a yearly framework, it issues more than it burns.\n\nWhat’s going on with the network’s supply dynamics, why are transaction fees prices dropping, and how does it look for the future of Ethereum?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBack in August 2021, Ethereum implemented EIP-1559, which introduced a fee-burning mechanism. Since then, the supply has had a direct connection to gas prices. Higher gas prices mean more ETH getting burned and vice versa.\n\nThis set the table for last year’s merge. The transition from proof-of-work to proof of stake ended up reducing the issuance of ETH by 90%, leading many to claim that the network was now “ultrasound money.”\n\nBut that label has been put to the test amid dwindling gas prices and lesser transactional volume.\n\nTransaction fees stand at around $0.28 for sending ETH across the protocol. According to Etherscan data, a trade on Uniswap currently costs $2.76—a far cry from its $4.17 price in early September and a level not seen since the collapse of FTX in late 2022.\n\nAmberdata’s head of research, Chris Martin, told Decrypt that the reasons for declining gas prices are three-fold.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n“The Ethereum Foundation's focus on scaling with Ethereum 2.0 has had enormous benefits for the network, making it cheaper and more secure,” was his first order of things. Martin then referred to the growth of Layer-2s, elucidating how the increase in these scaling solutions has “taken a lot of the volume off the mainchain.”\n\nIn third place, said Martin, is the lack of narrative–something the broader crypto market has been grappling with as of late. “The current market has left many waiting for the next big thing,” he explained, adding that “there are opportunities, only these are less than in 2021.”\n\nJulio Barragan, the director of education at Blocknative—a Web3 tool that lets users price, preview and monitor transactions—thinks the gas situation is only momentary. He told Decrypt that “as soon as volume picks back up, so will competition for block space, and the network will automatically adjust gas prices accordingly.”\n\nWhat’s to come, then? For Barragan, it’s a nebulous future.\n\n“Predicting the future of Ethereum gas prices is further complicated by the gradual acceptance of ERC-4337,” he told Decrypt. Also known as account abstraction, the upgrade will look to make crypto wallets as easy to use as email.\n\nBarragan added that it’s unclear what the long-term impact account abstraction and further adoption of layer-2’s will have on gas prices ”and therefore supply.”\n\nHe concluded that lower fees can bring more users and activity on-chain, but “more users ultimately lead to more congestion.”"}, {'id': 5, 'time': 'Sat, 30 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Looking for the Next Ethereum? 2 Cryptocurrencies to Buy Now - The Motley Fool', 'content': 'Since its launch in July 2015, Ethereum (ETH -0.21%) has been one of the best financial assets any investor could have owned, as the token\'s price has skyrocketed 53,000% over its roughly eight-year history (as of Sept. 27). The road hasn\'t been a smooth one, as the past couple years have shown, but it\'s hard to deny the rapid rise of this digital asset.\n\nWhile Ethereum might be on your radar as a potential buying opportunity today, especially since it\'s currently 67% below its peak price, it\'s worthwhile to consider two smaller cryptocurrencies to invest in.\n\nThe world\'s decentralized computer\n\nWhat makes Ethereum different from Bitcoin, the world\'s oldest and most valuable cryptocurrency network, is that it was the first blockchain to introduce smart contracts. These are software programs that automatically run when the stakeholders satisfy their ends of a particular agreement. Smart contracts are an innovative feature that underpin the promise that cryptocurrency could disrupt numerous industries by eliminating the need for middlemen.\n\nThis adds tremendous functionality to the Ethereum network, leading some to call it the world\'s biggest decentralized computing platform. In fact, Ethereum has become the undisputed leader in terms of decentralized applications, including for things like non-fungible tokens and decentralized finance protocols.\n\nEthereum\'s development pipeline is also indicative of the sheer number of computer programmers working on its advancement. An upgrade called the Merge transitioned the network to a proof-of-stake consensus system, which is more energy-efficient and an update that could set the blockchain up for better scalability. There are many more phases left on the horizon.\n\nIt might seem like a no-brainer decision to buy this crypto right now, but investors might want to look at these so-called "Ethereum killers."\n\nThe case for Cardano\n\nAs the seventh-most-valuable cryptocurrency, Cardano (ADA 6.69%) immediately comes to mind as a formidable rival to Ethereum\'s dominance. Cardano was launched in 2017 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, and its token has climbed in value by 874% during that time.\n\nWhat makes Cardano unique is not that it also enables the implementation of smart contracts or that it runs a PoS consensus mechanism, but it\'s the blockchain\'s unique development approach. While many cryptos adopt the Silicon Valley mindset of "go fast and break things," Cardano instead emphasizes being cautious and thoughtful when introducing changes to the network.\n\nThe current stage of development is known as Basho, which focuses on things like scaling and interoperability. This is the fourth of five parts, with the last stage focused on governance. Cardano relies on top researchers, computer scientists, and other academics from leading universities across the globe to help push it forward.\n\nCardano already has proven its ability to launch real-world enterprise-level solutions using its innovations. For example, it can better handle KYC/AML checks in the financial services industry. And it can help track supply chains in the agricultural sector.\n\nAs long as Cardano continues making progress on improving the network with new tech features, while also boosting utility in various industry settings, there\'s certainly the potential for its token to rise in value.\n\nThe case for Solana\n\nSolana (SOL 14.20%) was launched in 2020 by ex-Qualcomm engineer Anatoly Yakovenko. Its token has skyrocketed 1,890% since its founding, a wonderful gain. Currently, Solana carries a market cap of $7.8 billion, making it the ninth-most-valuable cryptocurrency in the world.\n\nLike Ethereum and Cardano, Solana also possesses functionality for smart contracts. And in addition to operating a PoS system, this blockchain also runs something known as proof-of-history (PoH). PoH basically eliminates the need to add timestamps to the data included in blocks, which can speed up transaction throughout. Solana is actually known as being the fastest crypto network, with a theoretical capacity to process 50,000 transactions per second (TPS). For comparison\'s sake, Ethereum can only handle less than 15 TPS right now.\n\nNaturally, this makes Solana a prime candidate to disrupt one of the most lucrative areas within the overall financial services space, and that\'s payments. In early 2022, Solana Pay was introduced. This innovative service allows a merchant and consumer to transact with each other directly, with instant settlement and virtually no fees. For businesses that run on thin margins, getting rid of the need to process costly credit card payments can lead to savings that flow straight to the bottom line.\n\nOf course, this puts Solana in direct competition with the likes of Visa and Mastercard. Even so, it\'s easy to get excited about the potential.'}]

Thanks to this, the term “Ethereum killer” gained traction as a way to describe the many competitive layers aiming for the top spot by attempting to overthrow the network’s dominance.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nFast-forward to the present, and Ethereum is still the most dominant PoS blockchain in some key areas. Layer Blockchains like Solana [SOL] and Avalanche [AVAX] have thus failed to dethrone Ethereum.\n\nThe latter’s secret weapon is arguably its Layer-2 networks, which have allowed it to overcome the previously-existing scalability limitations.\n\nA recent Grayscale analysis revealed that Optimism [OP], Base, and Arbitrum [ARB], three Ethereum Layer-2s, have surpassed Avalanche and Solana in TVL.\n\nThis is because Ethereum is already miles ahead of its competition in terms of adoption and the dApps that operate on its network.\n\n?Following a period of strong growth, top performing Layer 2s #Arbitrum, #Optimism and #BASE are surpassing Ethereum competitor Layer 1s like Solana and Avalanche in terms of total value locked (TVL) as of 9/25.\n\nHere’s why that’s important. (1/6) pic.twitter.com/DpTJyLQ5Nj — Grayscale (@Grayscale) September 29, 2023\n\nLayer-2 networks successfully assist Ethereum in bypassing its previous limitations. The L2s facilitate transaction processing, allowing the dApps to operate efficiently and cost effectively. There is one key component that has allowed Layer-2 networks to surpass some Layer-1 blockchains.\n\nWhile the latter have to build up their own dApps and clientele, Layer-2s benefit from Ethereum’s already existing dApps, of which there are plenty. On top of that, the same Layer-2s are also able to attract dApps on their own.\n\nLayer 2 blockchains process transactions from dApps and then “batch” them together before sending a compressed version back to the main network for settlement, acting as a side road or even a dedicated bus lane augmenting a major highway. (2/6) — Grayscale (@Grayscale) September 29, 2023\n\nCan Ethereum Layer-2s secure market cap dominance?\n\nThese observations confirmed that Ethereum was still able to command robust utility and demand at press time. But while its Layer-2 networks enjoyed robust TVL growth, they were still lagging behind Solana and Avalanche in terms of market cap.\n\nAccording to the latest data, Solana’s market cap was slightly over $8.8 billion, while Avalanche had a market cap of $3.27 billion at the time of writing. The closest of the aforementioned Layer-1s was Arbitrum at $1.17 billion, followed by Optimism at $1.06 billion.\n\nBase had the lowest market cap among them, at $530 million.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the ETH Profit Calculator\n\nIt makes sense that the Layer-2s would have lower market caps, considering that their counterparts are Layer-1 networks that have been around for longer. Nevertheless, the Layer-2 market caps highlighted their rapid growth.\n\nJudging by these factors, it is possible that they will get closer to Solana and Avalanche. These numbers also highlight the fact that it is now more difficult to beat Ethereum than ever before.'}]

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
The news articles suggest a mixed outlook for the Ethereum (ETH) market. On one hand, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin's discussions on protocol enhancements and ecosystem trade-offs indicate a potential for increased user convenience but also pose challenges related to protocol complexity and governance. Additionally, the outflow of assets from KuCoin, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, could be influenced by market uncertainty, regulatory pressures, and the rise of decentralized finance platforms. However, traders and analysts predict potential rallies for Ethereum against both the US dollar and Bitcoin, with Ethereum Layer-2 networks outperforming Layer-1s in terms of total value locked (TVL). Overall, while there may be short-term challenges and uncertainties, the long-term potential for Ethereum remains positive, with the possibility of market cap dominance for its Layer-2 networks.

So this is interesting, Julie.\n\nSo we've had, of course, Bitcoin futures ETFs for a while now. Of course, those made their debut during a very different time in the world of crypto. Bitcoin was a lot higher. Now we have these Ethereum-themed ETFs.\n\nI'll be very interested what demand is like. And to the extent there is demand, where does it come from? Does it come from retail investors, Julie, Josh, friends, and family, or is this, to the extent again that we see it, is it more of a financial advisor product? This is something they want to buy their customers.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: I'm not clear on the answers to any of these questions, right, because on the one hand, you have the SBF trial that is set to begin, that defenders of crypto would say, well, you get fraud in any asset class. This is not unique to crypto. Critics of crypto would say that there are qualities of cryptocurrencies that make it especially susceptible to fraud. In part, one of them being that it is not as regulated as other types of asset classes. So that debate rages on in the background, even as we get approval and beginning of trading of these new products.\n\nSo it's an interesting time, if you will. At the same time, we see Bitcoin up today, right? We see some buying again, even as the SBF trial is set to begin.\n\nEthereum, though, is trading lower. So all of these products are also under pressure in today's session. So it's unclear exactly what the situation will bring. I should also mention real quickly, Grayscale Investments is also now applied to have its Ethereum trust converted into an ETF. And of course, it's been on that similar quest with its Bitcoin ETF.\n\nStory continues\n\nJOSH LIPTON: Bitcoin, we just showed there. So near 28,000. It has rebounded strongly. But of course, way off that record of $69,000.\n\nI thought it was very interesting too, Julie, just what venture investors are doing right now. So these are obviously the men and women that are writing all those checks to those private companies. And this courtesy of Bloomberg, VC deals targeting cryptocurrency and blockchain projects have shrunk to about $7 billion in total this year. That is about, Julie, a quarter of the full year tally in each of 2021 and 2022. So bottom line, VCs tightening their purse strings a bit here.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Again, you have that at the same time that the likes of Coinbase are in DC still really taking their case to regulators.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: So much enthusiasm for those spot Bitcoin ETFs, right?

[{'id': 20, 'time': 'Tue, 03 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'EXCLUSIVE: Tim Draper Reflects On Bitcoin ETF As Grayscale Announces New Ethereum Fund - Nasdaq', 'content': 'A Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) ETF is looking very likely, with the world\'s leading crypto asset manager, Grayscale, as a possible front-runner to be approved by the SEC. In the meantime, Grayscale is lengthening its lead by applying to convert the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) to a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nGrayscale will be speaking at Benzinga\'s Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 14 in NYC.\n\nThe Grayscale Ethereum Trust represents 2.5% of all ETH in circulation and is the largest ETH investment vehicle in the world. Grayscale stated that the ETHE trust has always been on the path to becoming an ETF. Currently, the Ethereum underlying the trust is discounted at 30%, but the ETH would be worth $5.14 billion at full market value.\n\nShares of ETHE spiked 6.15% in value following the announcement of the spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nTim Draper, a prominent investor and entrepreneur known for successful investments in companies such as Tesla, Skype, and Coinbase, gave Benzinga exclusive comments on the Grayscale spot BTC ETF application. To Draper, approval seems to be a matter of time: "I am surprised it has taken so long. I\'m not sure why the SEC approved futures and not spot trading. It seems capricious," Draper said.\n\nHe expects the availability of a spot Bitcoin ETF to encourage more adoption and investments in BTC.\n\n"It will allow more people to participate in this new global, open, transparent, frictionless economy provided by Bitcoin and its blockchain. It will bring more light on the unbanked who can use Bitcoin to participate in the global economy," Draper said.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin\'s \'Fake Pump Seems Over:\' Crypto Analyst Capo Predicts Price Drop To $12K\n\nOne month ago, Circuit Judge Neomi Rao wrote a DC Circuit Court of Appeals opinion that favored Grayscale\'s application to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a more accessible Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). Rao\'s opinion said, in part, "The Commission failed to adequately explain why it approved the listing of two Bitcoin futures ETPs but not Grayscale\'s proposed Bitcoin ETP. In the absence of a coherent explanation, this unlike regulatory treatment of like products is unlawful. We therefore grant Grayscale\'s petition for review and vacate the Commission\'s order."\n\nOther applicants for a spot BTC ETF include ARK Investment, BlackRock, Bitwise, Fidelity/Wise Origin, GlobalX, Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF, VanEck, and WisdomTree.\n\nInvestor, author, and Forbes contributor Clem Chambers said: "It seems unlikely that there will be much of a gap between applicants if a BTC ETF is cleared… To me it\'s anyone\'s guess when it will be approved, but if the SEC had its way there will be no ETF unless they think it will be a negative for Bitcoin and crypto."\n\nThe legal victory in DC compels the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to revisit the Grayscale application for a spot BTC ETF after rejecting it.\n\nBloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart welcomed the news by raising the odds of the SEC approving a spot Bitcoin ETF to 75% by the end of 2023 and 95% by the end of 2024.\n\nFind out more about Bitcoin and its history.

These six newly launched funds offered investors their first opportunity to invest in Ether-based exchange-traded products.\n\nHowever, the launch of these ETFs didn’t seem to generate significant investor interest, and the ETH spot price has declined by 6.77% since then. While these ETH futures ETFs were expected to fuel a substantial price increase, they instead had a negative impact on the price.\n\nNevertheless, ETH has been in an uptrend since September 11. So, was this decline just a minor setback with $2,000 in its sights, or is it an early indicator that it lacks the strength to sustain its upward trajectory?\n\nETH Futures ETF’s botch\n\nOn the debut day, the combined trading volumes of these ETFs reached $1.92 million. Notably, the ProShares Ether Strategy ETF had the highest trading volume at $878,560, according to data from LSEG .\n\nIn an informative X thread , Vetle Lunde, a Senior Analyst at K33Research, shared some statistics about the underwhelming launch day for futures-based ETH ETFs.\n\nHe focused on trading volumes and made comparisons with similar product launches, particularly BITI and BITO, which are ProShares Bitcoin ETF products.\n\nIn his initial chart, he highlighted that ProShares dominated the trading volume, accounting for the majority of the first-day trading volume, which totaled $1.96 million across EETH (Ether Strategy ETF) and BETE (Bitcoin & Ether Equal Weight Strategy ETF). VanEck’s EFUT, which launched slightly ahead of its competitors, followed suit.\n\nIn his following chart, Vetle Lunde compared the day-one volumes of ETH ETFs with ProShares’ Bitcoin Future ETF products. The initial volumes for the ETH ETFs were considerably lower than those of BITO ($1.01B) and BITI ($7.21M) at their respective launches. The ETH ETFs’ day-one volumes represented only 0.19% of BITO’s launch volume and 27% of BITI’s launch volume.\n\nIn summary, he acknowledged the differences in market conditions during the BITO and BITI launches but still characterized the launch of ETH ETFs as uneventful.\n\nETH Price Analysis\n\nIn our previous analysis of ETH, we discussed the macro view, highlighting two potential scenarios. One possibility was that the price had initiated a new uptrend by breaking out from the descending resistance level.\n\nThe alternative scenario considered the increase from September 11 as a corrective move, suggesting that a new downturn might commence as the price faced rejection at the $1,760 resistance level.\n\nToday, we witnessed a 6.7% decline, measuring from yesterday’s high to today’s lowest point of $1,641. To support a potential move towards $2,000, the price needs to form a complete five-wave pattern starting from September 11.\n\nDespite briefly achieving a higher high yesterday, it faced a sharp rejection and is currently testing the September 18 high, which is considered to be the first wave of this pattern.\n\nCurrent Pattern May Be Invalid\n\nAccording to the Elliott Wave theory, it appears that the current pattern may be invalid. First, the assumed wave 3 fell slightly short of its optimum length, but it is still somewhat longer than wave 1, which adheres to Elliott Wave rules.\n\nWave 4 is typically a consolidative correction, often observed as a sideways movement and should not overlap with wave 2 territory. While it did produce a minor wick on the 4-hour chart, the candle close remained above wave 2. However, given that all three rules are currently stretched, it increasingly resembles a corrective move from September 11.\n\nThis could suggest that another downward trend has begun, with the price of ETH potentially heading below its September 11 low and below $1,500. The key determinant of the future outlook is how the price behaves around the $1,660 level. If it manages to stay above and starts moving upward, it could signal the start of an impulse wave.\n\nOn the other hand, if the descending move continues, it would indicate that sellers have regained control, potentially leading to a lower low.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPlease note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.

This was a pale shadow of the $1bn of assets that the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) garnered on its first two days of trading in October 2021 when it became the first US ETF trading in futures contracts linked to bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency.\n\n“The ether futures ETFs opened to a rather tame start on Monday. Total trading volume was $6.6mn which was a disappointing start,” said Gautam Chhugani, senior analyst, global digital assets at Bernstein, who believed media attention was focused on the impending trial of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried in New York.\n\nChhugani believed the lacklustre launch was “not surprising, given the continued weak retail sentiment” towards cryptocurrencies, whereas BITO launched at the peak of a digital bull market.\n\n“Like any listed security, success or failure cannot be measured on the first days of trading with market sentiment and the macro environment all having a bearing on performance,” said Bradley Duke, chief strategist at ETC Group, a provider of crypto exchange traded products.\n\nDespite rallying 10 per cent last week in anticipation of the wave of launches, the price of ether is still down 64 per cent from its peak in November 2021.\n\nIt fell 4 per cent to $1,663 on Monday as the launches underwhelmed — although as the ETFs are futures products, rather than investing in the “physical” spot cryptocurrency, purchases do not have any direct impact on the price.\n\nBitcoin is also down by 57 per cent from the highs it briefly touched in November 2021 as cryptocurrencies have proved to be procyclical “high beta” assets.\n\nThe bulk of the trading that did take place was in the pre-existing Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF), which changed its name to add “and Ether” on Tuesday, when it broadened out to incorporate both cryptocurrencies.\n\nBTF traded $4.6mn, according to Bernstein. The liveliest of the newly launched ETFs was the ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH), which saw turnover of $879,000, ahead of the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT), at $516,000.\n\nNevertheless, Chhugani argued that, if and when more retail investors do return to crypto there will be “wide availability of fair, secure and regulated products that help them attain crypto exposure without worrying about losing their savings from fraudulent exchanges”.\n\nDave Weisberger, chief executive and co-founder of CoinRoutes, an algorithmic trading platform for the digital asset industry, believed the funds would be popular with financial advisers, who cannot invest client money in crypto itself, but can do so via ETFs.\n\nEther is reasonably popular in Europe, where ETPs investing in both crypto futures and the physical spot currencies are permitted in many jurisdictions. The 13 pure ether ETPs available on the continent have combined assets of €1.1bn, according to data from TrackInsight, compared to €2.6bn in 20 bitcoin ETPs.\n\nOverall, ether has a market capitalisation of $200bn, compared to $535bn for bitcoin and $83bn for tether, the third-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nThe launches come as the US ETF industry remains barred from what is sees as the crown jewel of the crypto firmament — spot bitcoin funds.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has refused to allow the launch of spot bitcoin ETFs, citing fears of fraud and manipulation on the unregulated exchanges on which the digital tokens trade, concerns that it does not have about futures contracts listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a regulated venue.\n\nThe SEC has thus far maintained this stance despite losing a court case to crypto manager Grayscale, which sued over the regulator’s refusal to let it convert its $17.4bn Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), a private fund, into an ETF, in August.\n\nAfter that defeat, one school of thought was that the SEC might satisfy the court’s ruling — and equalise its treatment of spot and futures bitcoin ETFs — by retroactively axing BITO and its sister bitcoin futures ETFs.\n\nThe regulator’s willingness to allow ether futures ETFs would appear to have put that idea to bed.\n\nAlongside Grayscale, 10 other managers, including BlackRock, Fidelity, Ark Invest, WisdomTree, VanEck and Valkyrie, have outstanding filings in place to launch spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nC...'}]

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
The news articles suggest a mixed outlook for ETH in the cryptocurrency market. On one hand, the launch of Ethereum futures-based ETFs in the US has seen modest investor interest and a decline in ETH spot price, indicating a lack of immediate positive impact on the market. However, the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF by Grayscale and the positive sentiment surrounding a spot Bitcoin ETF approval could lead to increased adoption and investment in ETH, potentially driving the price higher in the long term. Overall, while short-term market trends may be uncertain due to low trading volumes and bearish signals, the long-term outlook for ETH remains optimistic with the potential for increased institutional adoption and regulatory approvals.

This has been an ongoing debate as the network evolves.\n\nIn the early days, Buterin explains, Ethereum strove to keep its base layer as simple and minimalist as possible. This aligned with the Unix philosophy of creating uncomplicated, flexible software. The goal was for Ethereum to provide a solid foundation for decentralized applications, with most functionality implemented through smart contracts built on top.\n\nOver time, however, some have questioned whether more features should be directly enshrined in the core protocol. But what does “enshrining” mean? Buterin defines it as making something intrinsic to the official Ethereum specification that client developers must implement. The alternative, “de-enshrining,” means removing a feature from the base layer and pushing it out to be handled by smart contracts instead.\n\nPros and Cons of Enshrining Features\n\nButerin analyzes the pros and cons of enshrining several potential features. Enshrining can provide efficiency gains, more robust security, and censorship resistance. But it also risks making transactions more expensive, over-complicating governance, and reducing flexibility to meet unanticipated user needs down the road.\n\nButerin uses account abstraction as a case study to analyze this debate. Earlier proposals like EIP-86 tried to make transactions just simple VM calls, minimizing protocol complexity but increasing miner responsibilities. More recent proposals like ERC-4337 still start outside the protocol but may later enshrine components for efficiency and security.\n\nButerin explores enshrining several other potential features:\n\nZK-EVMs: Could improve efficiency and allow leveraging Ethereum’s governance to manage bugs, but challenges around supporting diverse ZK technologies remain.\n\nProposer-builder separation: Could reduce trust assumptions, but extra-protocol approaches already exist.\n\nPrivate mempools: No current encryption technology seems robust enough to enshrine, but valuable to build at the application layer.\n\nLiquid staking: Could reduce centralization risks and open more staking options, but challenges around governance remain.\n\nMore precompiles: This could improve efficiency, but risks over-complicating the protocol and low usage of past precompiles.\n\nEnshrining features can provide efficiency, security, and censorship resistance. But it can also over-extend the protocol’s governance and make it too rigid for unanticipated user needs.\n\nHow the community may be fractured on enshrining.\n\nWithin the Ethereum community, differing perspectives emerge on this question. Pragmatists may prioritize enshrining features that offer clear benefits to users today, even if complex to govern. In contrast, purists argue that radically minimizing the base layer preserves Ethereum’s vision as a decentralized application platform.\n\nBusinesses and institutions want features that support their use cases quickly enshrined, while decentralization advocates worry that risks unaccountable control by privileged groups. Developers desire expanded base layer functionality to ease app building, but security researchers warn enshrinement may lock in suboptimal technical choices.\n\nAs Buterin thoughtfully lays out, navigating these tradeoffs will only grow more complex as expectations of Ethereum diversify and scale. However, discussing core principles helps anchor the conversation as progress compels reassessment. The full blog post “Should Ethereum be okay with enshrining more things in the protocol?” is well worth the read.\n\nUltimately, Ethereum’s open “soft forking” process allows continued evolution based on emerging community priorities. Buterin’s post thus provides a valuable framework to weigh options and build alignment as Ethereum marches toward its ambitious vision.'}]

Ethereum recorded its largest outflow day since August 21 on Wednesday as approximately 110,000 ETH worth roughly $181 million found their way out of crypto exchanges.\n\nThe amount of ETH on exchanges, rounding off to 10.6 million ETH, is at its lowest since May 2018 compared to the 115.88 million sitting outside exchanges.\n\nMarket Abuzz With ETH ETFs Launch\n\nThe latest developments coincide with the launch of ETH futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S., a move that has set the crypto market abuzz with anticipation. Several investment firms launched nine ETH futures ETFs on October 2, expanding the landscape for institutional investment in one of the world’s largest blockchain networks by total value locked.\n\nWhile investment firms like ProShares and Bitwise launched three and two funds, VanEck, Valkyrie, Kelly, Hashdex, and Volshares unveiled single ETH investment products.\n\nThe multiple ETFs launch raised investors’ hopes about the price of ETH hitting and possibly crossing the $2,000 mark before 2023 runs out. Although ETH leaped by 4% at the time of the launch, it lost the gains within 24 hours and, by the time of writing, was hovering around $1,640, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nMeanwhile, the trading volumes of the nine ETH futures ETFs at launch and present have been lower than expected.'}, {'id': 8, 'time': 'Thu, 05 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Time to 'pull the brakes' on Ethereum and rotate back to Bitcoin: K33 report - Cointelegraph", 'content': 'The relatively lackluster performance of nine new Ether (ETH) futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has prompted analysts at K33 Research to urge a “rotate back” into Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nIn an Oct. 3 market report, analysts Anders Helseth and Vetle Lunde said that it’s “time to pull the brakes on ETH and rotate back into BTC,” with the initial trading volume of Ether futures ETFs only accounting for 0.2% of what the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) amassed on its first day of trading in October 2021.\n\nWhile the analysts noted that no one expected to see initial trading volume on the Ether futures ETFs “come anywhere close” to that of the Bitcoin futures ETFs — launched amid a raging bull market — the underwhelming first-day numbers “strongly” missed expectations.\n\nDay one trading of ETH futures ETFs accounted for just 0.2% of what BTC futures ETFs amassed in 2021.

A Comprehensive Guide to Staking Rewards\n\nThe long-awaited Ethereum Merge has finally arrived, bringing exciting changes to the Ethereum network.\n\nOne of the key components of this upgrade is the transition from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.\n\nThis shift aims to enhance the scalability, security, and energy efficiency of the Ethereum blockchain. But what does this mean for Ethereum holders?\n\nShould you stake your Ethereum and earn staking rewards?\n\nThis comprehensive guide will explore the ins and outs of staking Ethereum, its benefits, risks, and various staking options.\n\nAlso read: Cloud and Crypto-Based Gaming: The End for Xbox and PlayStation?\n\nSource: CNBC\n\nUnderstanding Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Work (PoW)\n\nScalability Improvement\n\nUnder the previous Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, Ethereum had a limited transaction processing capacity of 15 transactions per second (TPS).\n\nThis pales compared to traditional financial payment services like Visa and MasterCard, which handle thousands of transactions per second.\n\nThe transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) will significantly improve Ethereum’s scalability, enabling it to process up to 100,000 TPS.\n\nThis increased capacity opens the doors to a broader range of projects and applications on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAlso read: Crypto-Friendly Banks in Europe?\n\nEnergy Efficiency Enhancement\n\nAnother significant advantage of PoS over PoW is its energy efficiency. The Ethereum Foundation estimates that the Ethereum blockchain will consume approximately 99.9% less energy under the PoS mechanism.\n\nThis improvement is a crucial step towards addressing the environmental concerns associated with blockchain technology.\n\nAdditionally, there is a growing trend towards using renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, for mining (PoW) and staking (PoS), further reducing the carbon footprint of the Ethereum network.\n\nWhat Does It Mean to Stake Ethereum?\n\nStaking Ethereum on a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain involves actively participating in the validation of transactions.\n\nUnlike the mining process in Proof-of-Work (PoW), where miners compete based on computational power, PoS randomly selects validators based on the amount and duration of their staked Ether.\n\nValidators are responsible for creating new blocks and validating transactions, ensuring the integrity and security of the network. In return for their participation, validators receive staking rewards in proportion to their stake.\n\nPros and cons of staking Ethereum\n\nSource: MARCA\n\nPros\n\nPassive Investment\n\nStaking Ethereum offers a passive investment opportunity. Once you stake your Ether, there is no additional effort required on your part.\n\nYou can sit back and earn staking rewards, currently averaging an annual percentage rate (APR) of around 4%.\n\nFor example, with a minimum requirement of 32 ETH, you could earn approximately 1.3 ETH per year (based on the current price of one ETH being around $1,320).\n\nSense of Community\n\nIf you are passionate about Ethereum and believe in its value, staking allows you to actively contribute to the network’s health and security.\n\nBy validating transactions and participating in the consensus mechanism, you become an integral part of the Ethereum community.\n\nStaking can be a rewarding experience for those who want to support the network while earning a reasonable payout.\n\nComparatively Low Risk\n\nCompared to other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum is a relatively stable staking option. Its popularity, global use, and established security protocols give it an advantage over many other tokens in the market.\n\nWhile the crypto market may experience fluctuations, Ethereum has shown resilience and potential for long-term growth.\n\nStaking Ethereum allows you to earn rewards without exposing yourself to excessive risk.\n\nCons\n\nWithdrawal Restriction\n\nCurrently, staked Ethereum cannot be withdrawn until the release of Ethereum 2.0, which is expected to take 12 to 18 months, assuming no further delays.\n\nIf you have liquidity constraints or anticipate needing immediate access to your funds, staking may not be a suitable option for you.\n\nHowever, some centralized crypto exchanges offer staking options with more flexibility.\n\nFees\n\nStaking Ethereum may involve certain fees, depending on your chosen staking method. Centralized crypto exchanges and other staking services may charge fees for their services.\n\nThese fees can vary, so it’s essential to consider the trade-off between liquidity costs and staking fees when selecting a staking option.\n\nValidator Penalties\n\nWhile rare, validators can face penalties for being offline or validating incorrect transactions. Non-compliance with the network’s rules can result in a reduction or complete loss of staked Ether.\n\nValidators must consistently fulfill their responsibilities to avoid penalties that may affect their returns.\n\nCustodial Staking Risks\n\nWhen ...'}]

This is when liquidity tokens are reused as collateral across numerous decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols at the same time. DeFi is an umbrella term used for lending, trading and other financial activities carried out on a blockchain.\n\n“Rehypothecation could then result in a cascade of liquidations if a staked asset drops sharply in value or is hacked or slashed due to malicious attack or a protocol error,” the note said.\n\nThe increase in staking has also reduced the appeal of ether from a “yield perspective,” especially given the backdrop of rising yields in traditional financial assets, the report added.

Ethereum is not just a digital currency; it is a blockchain platform that enables the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts.\n\nWith its innovative technology and widespread adoption, Ethereum has become the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nIn this article, we will delve into the world of Ethereum and analyze its price predictions for 2024.\n\n\\We will explore the factors that influence Ethereum’s price, the historical performance of the cryptocurrency, and expert opinions on its future trajectory.\n\nSo, if you’re curious about the potential of Ethereum and its place in the crypto market, keep reading!\n\nAlso read: Fidelity: Ethereum Drawing Investment Interest Alongside Bitcoin\n\nSource: U.Today\n\nEthereum Overview\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum was launched in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin as a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform.\n\nIt introduced the concept of smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with predefined rules and conditions. These smart contracts eliminate the need for intermediaries, making transactions more efficient and secure.\n\nIt operates on its native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), used to pay for transaction fees and computational services on the network.\n\nEthereum Functionality\n\nEthereum has revolutionized the blockchain industry with its wide range of functionalities. Let’s explore some of the key features that set Ethereum apart:\n\nSmart Contracts\n\nEthereum’s smart contracts allow for the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) and the execution of programmable transactions without intermediaries.\n\n\n\nThis feature has opened up a world of possibilities for developers and businesses, enabling them to build innovative solutions on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nNFTs\n\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs) have gained immense popularity recently, and Ethereum has played a significant role in their rise. NFTs are unique digital assets representing ownership of digital or physical items.\n\n\n\nEthereum’s ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards have become the industry standard for creating and trading NFTs.\n\nDApps\n\nEthereum has become the go-to platform for developing decentralized applications.\n\n\n\nThese dApps operate on the Ethereum blockchain and offer various services, including decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, and social networking. The Ethereum network’s flexibility and security make it an ideal choice for developers leveraging blockchain technology.\n\nDeFi\n\nDecentralized finance, or DeFi, is an ecosystem of financial applications built on blockchain technology.\n\n\n\nEthereum has played a pivotal role in the growth of DeFi, providing a platform for decentralized lending, borrowing, trading, and more. The rise of DeFi has brought significant attention and value to the Ethereum network.\n\nSource: CNBC\n\nThe Merge (Formerly Ethereum 2.0)\n\nEthereum is undergoing a major upgrade known as the Merge. This upgrade will transition Ethereum from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism.\n\n\n\nThe Merge will improve scalability, security, and sustainability, making Ethereum even more attractive for developers and users.\n\nEthereum’s First Hard Fork – Shanghai (Shapella) Upgrade\n\nEthereum has undergone several hard forks to improve its functionality and address issues.\n\n\n\nThe Shanghai (Shapella) upgrade was the first hard fork of Ethereum, which introduced various improvements, including enhanced security and performance. These upgrades ensure that Ethereum remains a robust and reliable blockchain platform.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction 2024\n\nNow, let’s dive into the Ethereum price predictions for 2024.

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
The news articles suggest that Ethereum has become more centralized due to the rise in staking after the Merge and Shanghai upgrades, leading to a decrease in overall staking yield. This centralization poses risks such as potential attacks and liquidity issues. On the price front, Ethereum is struggling to stay above the $1,600 support level, facing resistance at $1,650 and $1,665. Failure to clear these levels could result in further downside towards $1,585 and potentially $1,540. Overall, the market trend for Ethereum appears uncertain with a bearish bias in the short term, pending a clear breakout above key resistance levels for a potential recovery.

"""
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the ETH market is currently experiencing a bearish trend, as indicated by the downward trend in open price, sell signal on the MACD, and fluctuating number of unique addresses. The news analyst report presents a mixed outlook, with short-term uncertainty due to low trading volumes but long-term optimism driven by potential institutional adoption and regulatory approvals. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a cautious and conservative approach in navigating market uncertainties and prioritizing long-term gains over short-term profits.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is clear that while short-term market trends may be uncertain, the long-term outlook for ETH remains optimistic. Therefore, it is advisable to focus on long-term strategies to capitalize on potential gains driven by institutional adoption and regulatory approvals.

Given the current market conditions and the emphasis on long-term gains, I would take a conservative approach and hold my ETH position for now. My trading action would be 0.3, reflecting moderate confidence in the long-term bullish trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.
ACTION:
0.3
DAILY RETURN:
-0.003962710614941467
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that there is a bearish trend in the ETH market, with consistent decreases in open price, fluctuating user activity, and potential network congestion indicated by varying gas prices. The MACD signal consistently indicating a sell trend further supports the bearish outlook.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights some positive developments such as the introduction of Ethereum futures ETFs and the Ethereum Cancun upgrade, which could attract more users and developers to the network in the long term. However, the short-term price plunge of Ethereum and struggles to break key resistance levels suggest a bearish trend in the near future.

The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a cautious and conservative approach in trading ETH, focusing on long-term gains over short-term profits. It suggests that monitoring on-chain metrics, news developments, and market reflections is crucial for making informed trading decisions.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is clear that while there may be some positive long-term prospects for Ethereum with upgrades and institutional interest, the short-term market trend appears bearish. Therefore, a conservative trading approach with a focus on long-term gains is recommended to effectively manage risk and capitalize on potential opportunities.

Based on this analysis, I would take a slightly bearish stance on the market trend and assign a trading action of -0.3 to reflect my cautious approach and the need to prioritize long-term gains over short-term profits.

Given the mixed signals from the on-chain and news reports, it is important to prioritize long-term gains over short-term fluctuations.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is advisable to adopt a conservative trading approach and focus on long-term strategies.

*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
After analyzing the reports provided by the on-chain analyst, news analyst, and reflection analyst, it is clear that the overall sentiment towards ETH is bearish in the short term. The on-chain data indicates a downward trend in key metrics such as open price, total value transferred, and average gas price, with the MACD signal consistently showing a sell trend. The news analyst report highlights concerns about centralization and resistance levels that ETH is struggling to overcome, suggesting a potential further downside in price.

The reflection analyst emphasizes the importance of a cautious and conservative approach in navigating the volatile ETH market, focusing on long-term gains rather than reacting to short-term fluctuations. Given the mixed signals in the market and the uncertainty surrounding ETH's price movement, it is prudent to adopt a conservative trading strategy that prioritizes long-term gains and risk management.

Therefore, considering the bearish sentiment in the short term and the emphasis on long-term strategies, I would take a conservative approach and decide to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.7. This decision reflects a cautious stance in light of the current market conditions and the need to manage risk effectively while aiming for long-term profitability.

[{'id': 12, 'time': 'Sun, 08 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Why Ethereum developers may not prolong the fresh Devnet launch - AMBCrypto News', 'content': 'The network participation rate on Ethereum increased to 90% as Devnet-9 closes in on completion.\n\nThe Dencun testnet could launch before November ends.\n\nEthereum [ETH] developers had their usual All Core Developers Consensus (ACD) call on 5 October. From the meeting, they decided the timing for the Devnet-10 launch could happen earlier than initially projected.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nOnce the block generator clears the way\n\nAlthough the ACDC call #119 focused on the Dencun upgrade, the developers considered discussing the health and status of the latest developer Testnet Devnet-9 as a priority, alongside Devnet-10.\n\nFor the unfamiliar, Devnet-9 launched on 29 September, as a way to improve the network participation rate on the blockchain. The network participation rate is defined as the percentage of validators actively carrying out their duties on the network.\n\nDuring the meeting, the developers noted that the network participation rate was impressively high at 90%.\n\nHowever, Barnabas Busa, a DevOps Engineer for the Ethereum Foundation, mentioned that there were a few bugs with Devnet-9, especially in the execution layer. For context, the execution layer is the part of the network responsible for validating the state in the block header.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ethereum Foundation seemed to be working on fixing the bug as Geth developer Marius van der Wijden said that he was working on updating the block generator for the execution layer.\n\nNext, on the agenda was the Devnet-10, which is primarily to check the next maximum epoch churn limit in EIP-7514. EIP-7514 is designed to slow down the growth of the active validator set by tracking the soaring levels of staked ETH.\n\nDencun Testnet is set before November\n\nAt the time of writing, Santiment showed that the number of validator deposits was 1026. This was a notable decrease from the highs registered some weeks back. Therefore, the decline means that the objectives for Devnet-10 may already be set in motion.\n\nAs expected, Ethereum’s development activity has started to rise again. The Development Activity means the code committed by developers toward upgrades on a network. Over the past month, the metric tumbled. So, the slight rise implies that developers were starting to get back to polishing the network.\n\nRealistic or not, here’s ETH’s market cap in BTC terms\n\nAs per Devnet-10, Parithosh Jayanthi, another DevOps Engineer at the Foundation mentioned that it could launch as early as next week. The Berlin-based developer, however, mentioned that the timeframe could be subject to the quickness of solving outstanding bugs and issues. Busa also weighed in on the matter saying,\n\n“I would like to see all clients being able to participate and no more bugs on Devnet-9 before we proceed with the larger test. We should have a very stable, like 100% participation, before we move on.”\n\nRegarding the Dencun final upgrade the cal chairman Tim Beiko restated that the public Testnet would happen before Ethereum’s Instabul conference in mid-November called Devconnect.'}, {'id': 0, 'time': 'Sun, 08 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum 2.0 upgrade has brought more centralization to the blockchain - crypto.news', 'content': 'JPMorgan Chase &. Co. has shed light on how the Ethereum network decentralization has decreased significantly since the Merge event and Shanghai upgrade went live.\n\nThe rise of staking and centralization\n\nSince implementing the Merge and Shanghai upgrades, Ethereum has seen a substantial uptick in staking activities.\n\nStaking, a process where users lock up their crypto assets to support network operations, has its merits. According to a CoinDesk report citing JPMorgan research, this surge in staking activity comes at a cost: centralization.\n\nTraditionally, many in the crypto community prefer decentralized liquid staking platforms like Lido over their centralized counterparts.\n\nLido’s approach included adding more node operators to ensure no single entity controlled a significant portion of staked Ether (ETH). The aim was to address centralization concerns.\n\nHowever, centralization remains a risk. A concentration of liquidity providers or node operators could act as a single point of failure or even collude to create an oligopoly, potentially undermining the interests of the broader Ethereum community.\n\nEthereum, the world’s second-largest crypto, has become more centralized since the Merge and Shanghai upgrades. And JPMorgan is highlighting concerns over a decline in staking yields.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum’s Dencun upgrade: the next major step in scalability\n\nThe menace of rehypothecation\n\nAnother highlight from the report is rehypothecation. This complex term refers to the practice of reusing liquidity tokens as collateral across multiple decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols simultaneously.\n\nDeFi encompasses lending, trading, and other financial activities carried out on the blockchain.\n\nThe problem arises when a staked asset’s value sharply declines or faces a security breach or protocol error.\n\nIn such scenarios, rehypothecation could trigger a cascade of liquidations, jeopardizing the stability of the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nFurthermore, the report points out that the increase in staking has diminished the appeal of Ethereum from a yield perspective.\n\nThis shift is especially noticeable amid rising yields in traditional financial assets. The total staking yield has fallen from 7.3% before the Shanghai upgrade to approximately 5.5%.\n\nFrom a different perspective, the research data presented in December following Ethereum’s Merge upgrade in September 2022 reveals a significant reduction in the network’s energy consumption, akin to the energy usage of entire countries such as Ireland and Austria.\n\nThis decrease in power consumption positively contributes to environmental sustainability, aligning with broader global efforts to reduce the carbon footprint associated with blockchain technologies.\n\nEthereum’s core developers have introduced an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP-7514) as part of the upcoming Dencun upgrade, scheduled for activation in October 2023.\n\nThis proposal aims to slow down the rate of Ether staking. The intention is to provide the Ethereum community with more time to devise a practical reward scheme for stakers on the network.\n\nETH price analysis\n\nAs of the time of writing, the price of Ethereum (ETH) stands at $1,629, representing a 3.4% decline on the weekly timeframe.\n\nEthereum’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently sitting at 40.4.\n\nThe price of ETH is struggling to maintain the $1600 level after facing rejection at the $1700 resistance level. A failure to hold the $1600 level could potentially lead to a further decline to the $1500 level.\n\nFollow Us on Google News'}, {'id': 3, 'time': 'Sun, 08 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Vitalik Buterin proposes two-tier model to address 'centralization challenges' in Ethereum staking - CryptoSlate", 'content': 'Ethereum’s founder, Vitalik Buterin, unveiled an innovative proposal this week aimed at refining the platform’s staking mechanism.\n\nAs the world’s second-largest blockchain by market capitalization, Ethereum’s continued evolution is crucial for its vast user base, and these proposed changes aim to bolster decentralization, efficiency, and security.\n\nA Decentralized Vision for Staking\n\nThe primary concern addressed in Buterin’s proposal revolves around the limitations of the current staking system.\n\nNotably, he pinpoints decentralization issues surrounding the selection process for node operators across various staking pools and identifies inefficiencies in the current Layer 1 (L1) consensus mechanism.\n\nPresently, the constraints of solo staking combined with issues surrounding liquid staking mean that the platform can only process between approximately 100,000 to 1 million BLS signatures per slot.\n\nA further complication arises from the need for accountability in signing, which demands a participation record for each signature. If Ethereum scales up globally, using full danksharding for storage might still fall short, with a mere 16 MB per slot accommodating around 64 million stakers.\n\nDrawing inspiration from models implemented by Rocketpool and Lido, Buterin suggests adopting a two-tiered staking system. In this structure, Node Operators and Delegators emerge as central figures.\n\nTo rectify this, Buterin suggests a two-tiered staking model:\n\nA high-complexity slashable tier with frequent activity but limited participants (around 10,000). A low-complexity tier, where members engage sporadically and face minimal or no slashing risk.\n\nThis model would involve the modification of the validator balance cap and implementing a balance threshold to categorize validators into these tiers.\n\nButerin elaborates on potential roles for small-stakers:\n\nRandom selection of 10,000 small-stakers for each slot who sign off on their slot’s head. If divergences arise between the staker and node operator choices, it triggers an error, prompting community intervention.\n\nA system where a delegator declares their online presence, offering to serve as a small-staker for a set duration. For a node’s message to be acknowledged, it needs endorsement from both the node and a randomly picked delegator.\n\nAn approach in which delegators signal their availability, and subsequently, chosen delegators confirm their online status. These delegators can then publish inclusion lists for block validation.\n\nThe roles envisioned for small-stakers are characterized by their sporadic participation and non-slashable nature. Importantly, these roles tackle the significant issue of a potential 51% node operator majority attempting transaction censorship.\n\nButerin also contemplates these solutions in the context of staking pool features. He suggests protocols allowing validators to designate two staking keys: a persistent key and a temporary one, which, when combined, influence the block finalization process.\n\nThe Implications\n\nButerin’s proposal isn’t just technical fixes; it’s a vision for Ethereum’s future. By decentralizing the staking process further and integrating safety nets, he aims to:\n\nEmpower those lacking resources for solo staking, granting them meaningful participation avenues.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market has been experiencing a downward trend, with decreasing open prices, a decrease in successful transactions, and a consistent sell trend indicated by the MACD signal. On the other hand, the news analyst report presents a more positive outlook for ETH, highlighting factors such as lower gas fees, increased non-exchange ETH holdings, and the launch of ETH futures ETFs, all of which suggest a potential price rebound.

Taking into account the reflection analyst report, which emphasizes a cautious and conservative approach to trading ETH, it is evident that a long-term strategy focused on managing risk and capitalizing on potential gains is crucial in the current market environment. Given the mixed signals from the on-chain and news reports, it is important to prioritize long-term gains over short-term fluctuations.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is advisable to adopt a conservative trading approach and focus on long-term strategies. While the market may experience short-term fluctuations, the overall trend for ETH is likely to be upward in the long run. Therefore, my trading action would be to buy ETH with a confidence level of 0.7, indicating a moderate level of confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.
ACTION:

DAILY RETURN:
0.016079338455098124
REASONING:
After analyzing the reports provided by the on-chain analyst, news analyst, and reflection analyst, it is clear that the overall sentiment towards ETH is bearish in the short term. The on-chain data indicates a downward trend in key metrics such as open price, total value transferred, and average gas price, with the MACD signal consistently showing a sell trend. The news analyst report highlights concerns about centralization and resistance levels that ETH is struggling to overcome, suggesting a potential further downside in price.

The reflection analyst emphasizes the importance of a cautious and conservative approach in navigating the volatile ETH market, focusing on long-term gains rather than reacting to short-term fluctuations. Given the mixed signals in the market and the uncertainty surrounding ETH's price movement, it is prudent to adopt a conservative trading strategy that prioritizes long-term gains and risk management.

Therefore, considering the bearish sentiment in the short term and the emphasis on long-term strategies, I would take a conservative approach and decide to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.7. This decision reflects a cautious stance in light of the current market conditions and the need to manage risk effectively while aiming for long-term profitability.

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the short-term trend for ETH is bearish, with indicators such as the MACD signal on sell and a decrease in the average gas price pointing towards a downward market sentiment. The news analyst report highlights a mix of positive and negative factors influencing the market, including potential price rallies for ETH and altcoins but also challenges like Ethereum's struggle to break above $2,000 and declining network activity. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a cautious and conservative trading approach in navigating the volatile ETH market.

Taking into account the synthesized reports, it is evident that while there may be short-term opportunities for price rallies, the overall market trend for ETH appears uncertain and potentially volatile. Therefore, prioritizing long-term gains over short-term profits is advisable to manage risks effectively and capitalize on potential opportunities in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape.

Considering the current market conditions and the emphasis on a conservative trading approach, I would take a slightly bearish stance with a trading action of -0.3. This reflects a moderate level of confidence in the bearish market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately by prioritizing long-term gains over short-term profits.

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
The recent downturn in crypto prices has seen Ether losing ground to Bitcoin, with Ether dropping around 5.4% to $1,639 while Bitcoin was down around 2.3% to $27,290. Additionally, the conflict in the Middle East has led to significant losses in the cryptocurrency market, with over $100 million in liquidations and major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin declining. Despite these challenges, Bitcoin's resilience and ability to maintain crucial support levels suggest a potential path towards $30,000, while Ethereum may see further declines before a potential bounce in lower areas. The market trend appears to be cautious and sensitive to geopolitical events, with potential for increased price sensitivity in the future.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
After analyzing the reports provided by the on-chain analyst, news analyst, and reflection analyst, it is clear that the overall sentiment towards ETH is bearish in the short term. The on-chain data indicates a downward trend in key metrics such as open price, total value transferred, and average gas price, with the MACD signal consistently showing a sell trend. The news analyst report highlights concerns about centralization and resistance levels that ETH is struggling to overcome, suggesting a potential further downside in price.

The reflection analyst emphasizes the importance of a cautious and conservative approach in navigating the volatile ETH market, focusing on long-term gains rather than reacting to short-term fluctuations. Given the mixed signals in the market and the uncertainty surrounding ETH's price movement, it is prudent to adopt a conservative trading strategy that prioritizes long-term gains and risk management.

Therefore, considering the bearish sentiment in the short term and the emphasis on long-term strategies, I would take a conservative approach and decide to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.7. This decision reflects a cautious stance in light of the current market conditions and the need to manage risk effectively while aiming for long-term profitability.
ACTION:

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the short-term trend for ETH is bearish, with indicators such as the MACD signal on sell and a decrease in the average gas price pointing towards a downward market sentiment. The news analyst report highlights a mix of positive and negative factors influencing the market, including potential price rallies for ETH and altcoins but also challenges like Ethereum's struggle to break above $2,000 and declining network activity. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a cautious and conservative trading approach in navigating the volatile ETH market.

Taking into account the synthesized reports, it is evident that while there may be short-term opportunities for price rallies, the overall market trend for ETH appears uncertain and potentially volatile. Therefore, prioritizing long-term gains over short-term profits is advisable to manage risks effectively and capitalize on potential opportunities in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape.

Considering the current market conditions and the emphasis on a conservative trading approach, I would take a slightly bearish stance with a trading action of -0.3. This reflects a moderate level of confidence in the bearish market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately by prioritizing long-term gains over short-term profits.

The news articles highlight ongoing efforts to improve Ethereum's infrastructure and address centralization concerns, but the overall sentiment remains cautious due to geopolitical tensions and market volatility predictions.

In light of these reports, it is advisable to adopt a conservative trading approach focused on long-term strategies rather than short-term gains.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum Foundation faced a sandwich attack during its recent sale of 1,700 ETH on Uniswap V3. The foundation, which is a key player in the Ethereum ecosystem, was caught off guard, resulting in a loss of U.S. $9,101.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to data from EigenPhi, the Ethereum Foundation\'s transaction was targeted by an MEV Bot (0x00...6B40). This bot, capitalizing on the opportunity, managed to make a neat profit of U.S. $4,060 after covering its costs.\n\nThe foundation\'s sale took place at 16:18 UTC+8, where they exchanged 1.7K ETH for a hefty 2.738 million USDC. A peek into the foundation\'s wallet reveals a balance of 240.68 ETH, 3.238 million USDC, 49,700 DAI and 10,000 ARB, bringing their total assets to a cool $3.687 million.\n\nBut what exactly is a sandwich attack? For the uninitiated, a sandwich attack is a form of front-running tactic used in the world of decentralized exchanges. In this strategy, a malicious actor spots a pending transaction on the Ethereum network and quickly places their own transaction with a higher gas fee, ensuring it gets processed first.\n\nThey then place another transaction right after the target transaction, effectively "sandwiching" the original transaction. This allows the attacker to manipulate the price in a way that they can profit from the victim\'s trade.\n\nThe fact that the Ethereum Foundation, a central entity in the Ethereum space, fell victim to such an attack raises eyebrows. It brings forth questions about the security measures in place and the vulnerabilities that exist even for seasoned players in the crypto arena.\n\nInterestingly, there is a pattern observed on Ethereum Foundation\'s sales. It often liquidates Ethereum just before significant sell-offs occur. While it is speculative to draw conclusions, the timing of its sales in relation to market movements has not gone unnoticed by keen market observers.'}, {'id': 11, 'time': 'Tue, 10 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Benjamin Cowen Doubles Down on Ethereum Call, Says Big ETH Collapse By End of the Year Most Likely Outcome - The Daily Hodl', 'content': "A widely followed crypto analyst is doubling down on his prediction for Ethereum (ETH), the top smart contract platform by market cap.\n\nIn a new strategy session, crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen tells his 787,000 YouTube subscribers that Ethereum is likely to collapse by the end of the year.\n\n“I think Ethereum returns home before it goes on any sustained bull run. A lot of people got excited – I mean, they can get excited all they want about this rally. It’s still just a 2X move. You can celebrate a 2X move if you want, but you can get that in the stock market pretty easily. I mean, a lot of stocks do 2X moves…\n\nYou ride a 50X move up, and then, you know, you take a side, whether you’re bullish or bearish, and everyone celebrates $100 moves in either direction. But that’s not what you’re here for. What you’ll notice is that every time Ethereum made a rally to new highs, it did not happen until Ethereum went home first. ‘Home’ is the lower regression band. Right now, we need to see Ethereum go home for new highs to come.\n\n[We’ve] still got to see ETH go home, my friends, and it hasn’t happened yet. So, I think that it will. And again, you can see on these lower time frames, at least over the last year and a little over a year, that it’s trying to hold those levels. But again, at some point, it likely breaks, and when it does, that’s likely when Ethereum starts to head home.”\n\nAccording to an analysis published almost a year ago, Cowen says “home” for ETH is between $600-$800, where his own version of the logarithmic regression band sits.\n\nCowen says ETH will be coming “home” within the next several months.\n\n“I think the most likely outcome is for Ethereum to drop below $1,200 within the next two and a half months and I mean it could certainly go lower.”\n\nETH is worth $1,572 at time of writing, down 5% in the last week.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Ether\'s price has been stuck alongside bitcoin\'s this year, but patient investors with a long horizon could be rewarded as ethereum reclaims its dominance in crypto\'s smart contracts space and new use cases emerge, according to Standard Chartered. In recent years, a wave of ethereum competitors have emerged to challenge the flagship Web3 blockchain network\'s high fees and slow processing times, including Solana , Cardano and Polkadot . Now, "layer 2" scaling solutions and new use cases are becoming "ever more important" and could help lift the price of ether 5x in the next three years before rocketing even higher, Standard Chartered said in a note Wednesday. "We expect further change ahead," said Geoff Kendrick, an analyst at the London-based bank. "Layer 2 scaling solutions … are likely to grow in importance over time, particularly as architecture upgrades expected in early 2024 sharply lower fees on these platforms. This should help to cement ETH\'s dominance in the smart contract space, thereby increasing its P/E ratio (if not its earnings) over the next couple of years." "Layer 2" solutions such as Arbitrum and Optimism are developed on ethereum itself to enhance its efficiency and help keep transactions within the ethereum ecosystem, rather than moving to a competing network in an attempt to find lower fees. Keeping activity on ethereum should increase the token\'s price-to-earnings ratio, Kendrick said. "We think Ethereum\'s established dominance in smart contract platforms, along with emerging uses in gaming and tokenization, has the potential to push ETH to the $8,000 level by end-2026," he added. That level is "a stepping stone to our long-term \'structural\' valuation estimate of $26,000-$35,000," he added. ETH.CM= 1Y mountain Ether (ETH) over the past year That valuation assumes future use cases and revenue streams that may not exist yet, Kendrick noted. He highlighted gaming and tokenization of real-world assets as the next big use cases for the network. Both could add demand to its existing nonfungible token and decentralized finance channels, respectively, by giving "real world" companies and industries examples of how and why they could benefit from moving certain processes onto ethereum.

This week’s publication of a research paper outlining the design for BitVM, “a computing paradigm to express Turing-complete Bitcoin contracts,” got bitcoiners buzzing on social-media forums. The big idea is that Ethereum-style smart contracts and might be coming to Bitcoin, raising the possibility of a existential transformation of the originally payments-focused blockchain – perhaps even a bigger development than the advent of NFTs earlier this year via the Ordinals protocol. “Bitcoin is about to become a lot smarter,” according to one post on X. “Something really interesting cooking,” wrote another. The author of the BitVM paper is Robin Linus, a core contributor to ZeroSync, a Swiss non-profit that’s building tools for Bitcoin developers to use zero-knowledge proofs – a type of cryptography that has become one of the hottest trends of 2023 in the Ethereum ecosystem. “BitVM is an amazing breakthrough because while there are many gaping holes right now in the BitVM, they are mostly solvable,” Bob Bodily, CEO of Bioniq.io, a Bitcoin Ordinals marketplace, wrote in a post on X. One person went so far as to inscribe Linus’s paper onto the Bitcoin blockchain. BitVM relies on computations performed off-blockchain and then verified on-chain using a setup similar to those found in so-called optimistic rollups on Ethereum. The details are quite technical, as evidenced by an article on the topic in Bitcoin Magazine that delved into the arcana of “NAND gates.” A poster on X put up a white flag, asking “Can you explain BitVM in plain English?” and then giving only two choices, “No” and “No way.” There were memes aplenty.\n\nStory continues\n\nHARSH WINTER: In the last edition of The Protocol, we recounted the rounds of layoffs coursing through the blockchain industry – at Chia Network, Chainalysis and Yield Protocol. Such moves come as digital-asset markets have stalled over the past several months, prolonging what many experts describe as an unusually harsh “crypto winter.” According to the analysis firm Messari, fundraising for crypto startups has hit a three-year low. Well, over the past week, there’s been more job cuts. CoinDesk broke the news this week that Blocknative, a provider of tools on the Ethereum blockchain, had reduced headcount by a third, which works out to about a dozen people. Last week, the crypto custody firm Ledger cut 12% of staff, or about 88 jobs, citing “macroeconomic headwinds” that are “limiting our ability to generate revenue.” Yuga Labs, the NFT company behind the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection, eliminated an unspecified number of roles, even though it closed a $450 million funding round just 18 months ago, Unchained reported. In a statement on Yuga’s website, CEO Daniel Alegre wrote that the company had “a number of projects that, while well-intentioned, either spread the team too thin or required execution expertise beyond our core competencies.” It bears pointing out that the broader economy doesn’t seem to be suffering in the same way; the U.S. added 336,000 jobs in September, double analysts’ forecasts, a government report last week showed.\n\nISRAELI CRYPTO FIRMS DEAL WITH WAR: The past week’s surprise attack on Israel by Hamas fighters has upended the daily routines of crypto firms based in the Middle Eastern country, known as a haven for startups and tech companies. Several Israeli crypto executives and developers told CoinDesk they weren’t experiencing severe business disruptions, especially since many of them work remotely. But already, many employees of the firms are getting called up to reserve duties in the army.

Based on the synthesized reports and the emphasis on long-term strategies, I would take a slightly bearish stance on the market trend with a trading action of -0.3, reflecting a moderate level of confidence in the bearish outlook and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.

*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market has been exhibiting a mixed trend with some uncertainty and a slight bearish bias. The MACD signal indicating a sell trend adds to this cautious sentiment. However, the increasing unique addresses and total value transferred suggest growing interest and activity in the market.

On the other hand, the news analyst report paints a bullish outlook for Ethereum, with predictions of significant price increases driven by its dominance in smart contract platforms and emerging use cases. Technical upgrades and upcoming events are also expected to contribute to further growth in the market.

In reflection, it is evident that a conservative approach focused on long-term strategies and risk management has been effective in navigating the uncertain market conditions. While there have been some losses in profit due to the bearish trend, it is crucial to prioritize risk management and capitalize on potential gains over time.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is advisable to adopt a long-term strategy and maintain a cautious approach in trading ETH. The positive market sentiment from the news analyst report may indicate potential growth in the future, but the uncertainty highlighted in the on-chain analyst report suggests the need for careful risk management.

Therefore, my trading action would be to buy ETH with a confidence level of 0.5, indicating a neutral stance with a slight inclination towards the positive market trend projected in the news analyst report. This decision aligns with the emphasis on long-term strategies and risk management to maximize overall profit in the ETH market.

In early 2024, Ethereum is slated to implement “proto-danksharding,” which would increase the network’s transaction speed and lower transaction costs.\n\n“Layer 2 scaling solutions… are likely to grow in importance over time, particularly as architecture upgrades expected in early 2024 sharply lower fees on these platforms. This should help to cement ETH’s dominance in the smart contract space, thereby increasing its P/E (price to earnings) ratio over the next couple of years.”\n\nWith ETH trading for $1,540 at time of writing, an increase to $35,000 would represent a 2,173% jump, while a move to $8,000 would be a 419% increase.\n\nStandard Chartered is the 43rd largest bank in the world with $820 billion of assets under management.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that there are multiple indicators pointing towards a bearish trend in the short term for ETH. The decreasing metrics such as open price, total gas used, unique addresses, total value transferred, and average gas price, along with the sell signals from the MACD indicator, suggest a downward trend. However, the recent buy signal could indicate a potential reversal or temporary uptrend that needs to be monitored closely for further confirmation.

The news analyst report highlights the recent challenges in the cryptocurrency market, with Ether losing ground to Bitcoin and facing declines due to geopolitical events. Bitcoin's resilience and potential path towards $30,000 contrast with Ethereum's potential further declines before a bounce in lower areas. The market trend appears cautious and sensitive to external factors, indicating potential price sensitivity in the future.

The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a conservative approach focused on long-term gains and risk management in navigating the volatile ETH market. Key indicators consistently point towards a bearish trend, underscoring the need for prioritizing risk management and capitalizing on gains over time.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is clear that the market trend for ETH is cautious and potentially bearish in the short term, with uncertainties surrounding geopolitical events and market fluctuations. Therefore, a long-term strategy focused on risk management and capitalizing on potential gains over time is recommended.

Based on this analysis, my trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.7, reflecting a cautious approach towards the current market conditions and the prioritization of long-term strategies over short-term gains.
ACTION:
-0.7
DAILY RETURN:
-0.0002722003903327108
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain, news, and reflection analyst reports, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing uncertainty and potential volatility. The on-chain data indicates fluctuating trends in various metrics, while the news report highlights security concerns and potential price drops for Ethereum in the short term. On the other hand, there is optimism surrounding Bitcoin's advancements and potential for increased transaction volumes in the future.

Considering the bearish short-term outlook for Ethereum and the overall cautious market sentiment, a conservative trading approach focused on long-term gains and risk management is advisable. It is crucial to prioritize risk management over short-term profits and closely monitor key indicators such as the MACD signal, average gas price, and network activity.

In conclusion, the market trend for ETH appears uncertain in the short term, with potential for both bullish and bearish movements. Therefore, a conservative trading strategy is recommended to mitigate risks and capitalize on potential gains over time.

Based on the synthesized reports and the emphasis on long-term strategies, I would take a slightly bearish stance on the market trend with a trading action of -0.3, reflecting a moderate level of confidence in the bearish outlook and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.
ACTION:

DAILY RETURN:

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market has been exhibiting a mixed trend with some uncertainty and a slight bearish bias. The MACD signal indicating a sell trend adds to this cautious sentiment. However, the increasing unique addresses and total value transferred suggest growing interest and activity in the market.

On the other hand, the news analyst report paints a bullish outlook for Ethereum, with predictions of significant price increases driven by its dominance in smart contract platforms and emerging use cases. Technical upgrades and upcoming events are also expected to contribute to further growth in the market.

In reflection, it is evident that a conservative approach focused on long-term strategies and risk management has been effective in navigating the uncertain market conditions. While there have been some losses in profit due to the bearish trend, it is crucial to prioritize risk management and capitalize on potential gains over time.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is advisable to adopt a long-term strategy and maintain a cautious approach in trading ETH. The positive market sentiment from the news analyst report may indicate potential growth in the future, but the uncertainty highlighted in the on-chain analyst report suggests the need for careful risk management.

Therefore, my trading action would be to buy ETH with a confidence level of 0.5, indicating a neutral stance with a slight inclination towards the positive market trend projected in the news analyst report. This decision aligns with the emphasis on long-term strategies and risk management to maximize overall profit in the ETH market.

After reviewing the on-chain, news, and reflection analyst reports, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing mixed trends.

This initiative allows Upland to accelerate on its mission to build the world’s largest digital open economy in the metaverse through its dynamic ecosystem of players, entrepreneurs, creators, and developers by allowing its utility token, Spark, to be traded outside of Upland’s boundaries.\n\nUpland presented the Sparklet White Paper to the community to review in late September, which outlined the initiative to bridge the in-app token Spark to Ethereum where it will be mirrored and minted as the Sparklet token, equivalent to one-thousandth of Spark. The Sparklet White Paper details the need for Spark to support value creation in the metaverse. It is the resource required for world-building, joint community projects, no-code NFT minting, and “manufacturing” of 3D map assets, such as cars, decor, and more. Current and future utility details along with tokenomics, Sparklet vesting schedules, implementation, and token distribution were also presented to the Upland community in the White Paper for comment ahead of the governance vote.\n\nWith the community approval of the Sparklet White Paper, Upland is now preparing the next steps to make Spark tradable outside of Upland via a Token Tradability Event (“TTE”), where Spark, a utility token on the EOS blockchain, will be mirrored by the Sparklet token on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nBy executing the Spark TTE, Upland advances its path toward progressive decentralization, where Spark holders will now be able to trade Sparklet in liquid markets. Additionally, it aims to enhance its presence within the broader Web3 industry through listing on external exchanges, attracting a larger user base to the platform, and enhancing the platform’s network effects.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Adhering to our mission to build the largest digital open economy, Sparklet allows us to take the next step towards progressive decentralization in a responsible way by offering tradability to our users while having mechanisms in place that can shield and protect Upland’s economy from unwanted externalities,” says Co-Founder and Co-CEO of Upland, Dirk Lueth. “The upside of Sparklet traded on an external exchange means of course higher visibility and more credibility for Upland, which contributes to a positive ripple effect in the web3 community, and also improved liquidity for current Spark holders.”\n\nSpark holders in Upland will have different reasons why they want to increase or decrease their holdings. For instance, some players might want to accelerate building structures on their virtual properties which requires more Spark while others are done with most of their world-building plans and have a reduced need for Spark which they can now liquidate via Sparklet. Creators, Entrepreneurs and Brands might need different amounts of Spark because they want to increase or decrease their manufacturing capabilities. And finally Developers might create additional demand because they introduced a new utility for Spark.\n\n“We’ve been able to study the Spark economy since we launched it two years ago, which gives us the confidence to provide the right model for it to be sustainable for decades to come in Upland,” says Co-Founder and Co-CEO of Upland, Idan Zuckerman. “With Sparklet, we are excited that players will be able to truly own Spark and trade it in liquid markets.”\n\nCurrently, Spark needs to be staked in Upland in order to build or manufacture items. The white paper states that there are over 130,000 players in Upland who hold Spark, with 93.6% of those who purchased Spark using it to build in Upland.\n\nSparklet equals one-thousandth (1/1,000) of one Spark and will exist on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token. Sparklet tokens will be able to be uploaded from Ethereum to Upland, where they will be converted into Spark at x/1,000 factor, while Spark tokens can be reclaimed from Upland to Ethereum using the reverse calculation.\n\nAs part of the TTE, a total of 1,000,000,000 Sparklet tokens as finite supply will be issued on Ethereum. These tokens will be mirrored by 1,000,000 Spark that will be minted in Upland on the EOS blockchain. The community-approved Sparklet White Paper highlights that the amount of Spark that is under ownership in Upland will always be exactly equal to the amount of Sparklet that is present in an escrow on the Ethereum bridge.\n\nUpland, a US based company headquartered in Silicon Valley, CA, has not issued a tradable token given regulatory uncertainties in the US crypto space.

That said, just as the equity ETF market has evolved to offer a plethora of sophisticated products beyond simple price tracking offerings, so too must the Ethereum ETF space.\n\nWith that understanding, a particular vision emerges — one where, just as an investor in an equity ETF demands a pro-rata dividend, an Ethereum investor assertively seeks out staking rewards. To omit such rewards is akin to denying oneself a full, comprehensive return on investment.\n\nStaking is Ethereum’s beating heart. It is the mechanism that rewards any ETH holder for bonding their holdings to validators, who then propose and attest to new blocks on the Ethereum blockchain, and in return are rewarded with newly minted Ethereum as well as a portion of the transaction fees in the block.\n\nTo put it plainly, staking is the modern-day operating system for Ethereum. And therefore staking must play a role in an ideal Ethereum ETF.\n\nAs an example, a fund with a balance of 9,600 ETH (approx. $15 million) could earn an additional 32 ETH on a monthly basis by staking. This not only enhances the fund’s revenue, but also contributes to Ethereum’s network security. Staking ensures validators are actively participating and making the network more resilient against potential attacks.\n\nIncorporating staking rewards also gives investors a fuller experience of Ethereum ownership. These rewards can potentially provide enhanced returns over time when compared to solely tracking Ethereum’s price performance, as has historically been the case.\n\nStaking rewards can offer a unique avenue for fund managers. They can be innovative in compensating investors, either by directly distributing the rewards pro-rata to investors like a dividend, or by reducing management fees and adding staking rewards to the fund’s total allocation, thus increasing the net asset value (NAV) for each investor. This creates a win-win scenario for both the fund and the investor.\n\nWhy staking matters\n\nSince the Merge in 2022, Ethereum’s supply has been on a decline. A portion of the transaction fees paid by Ethereum users is burned, the amount of which is usually higher than the new supply issuance. This deflationary nature makes ETH scarcer by the day, increasing its inherent value.\n\nAn ETF that stakes and captures new issuance might, in essence, be capturing an increasingly valuable asset.\n\nA staking-centric approach reinforces Ethereum’s network. As more ETH is staked and more validators join the network, the cost to attack Ethereum rises exponentially, fostering a more secure environment for transactions and smart contracts.\n\nStaking is not without its challenges. The dynamic unbonding period of Ethereum means that once staked, the assets aren’t immediately liquid. To address this, an Ethereum ETF could strategically stake only 50% of its holdings.\n\nFurthermore, by incorporating a liquid staking protocol which adheres to KYC/AML norms, the ETF could allocate another 30% — ensuring the requirements of institutional investors are met without compromising liquidity.\n\nRead more from our opinion section: DeFi has a reputation problem\n\nLiquid staking is a mechanism where users stake their crypto assets — in this case, ETH — and receive a token representing their staked amount in return. These tokens can then be traded, sold or used in other decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, essentially making them a liquid counterpart to an otherwise locked asset.\n\nIt’s essential that institutional investors look for protocols who fulfill KYC/AML requirements. The remaining 20% could be maintained in spot ETH, offering additional immediate liquidity.\n\nAs Ethereum ETFs gain momentum, their success will hinge on delivering returns while addressing liquidity concerns.\n\nAn intelligent combination of staking platforms and liquid staking protocols can be the bridge between these two worlds, ensuring Ethereum investors get the complete value they deserve, analogous to the dividends stock investors have come to expect. This vision paves the way for an Ethereum ETF that truly resonates with the modern investor’s needs.\n\nFor informational and advertising purposes only.

He stated, “Ethereum is moving within a steady range. Interestingly, the TD Sequential presented a buy signal at the lower end of this range, suggesting ETH could rebound to $1,630. But be cautious – If ETH closes below $1,530, the bullish outlook will be invalidated.”\n\nSource:TradingView/Ali\n\nThe analyst added that $1,530 was a critical demand zone, and Ethereum ought to trade above it to avoid a steep correction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthereum was hovering around the $1,550 area at the time of writing, according to CoinGecko. Therefore, ETH continues to maintain a bullish image despite it being on shaky grounds.\n\nEthereum Whales are on a Buying Spree\n\nDespite the downturn being experienced in the market, ETH whales are not relenting in their quest to accumulate more coins.\n\nLeading market insight provider Santiment acknowledged that both the top 10 exchange and non-exchange wallets were getting richer by the day as their spending rate was going through the roof.\n\nSource: Santiment\n\nAccording to Santiment data, the 10 largest non-exchange and exchange addresses hold ETH worth $61.6 billion and $10.9 billion, respectively.\n\nThis suggests that the bearish momentum in the general crypto market is not dampening the spirits of ETH whales as they continue accumulating more coins.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum is set for massive growth based on a recent analysis by Standard Chartered Bank. The financial giant stipulated that ETH could skyrocket by 5x and hit $8,000 by the end of 2026, as reported by ZyCrypto.\n\nEthereum continues to be king in various crypto sectors, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nTherefore, Standard Chartered believes this, coupled with real-world adoption in areas such as tokenization and gaming, will spur Ethereum demand, which is bullish for ETH price.'}, {'id': 18, 'time': 'Sat, 14 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Rising Whale Activity on These Three Ethereum-Based Altcoins a Sign of Potential Bullish Turnaround: Santiment - The Daily Hodl', 'content': "Crypto analytics platform Santiment says that three altcoins are showing signs of potentially reversing course after a bearish run.\n\nSantiment says that whale activity is on the rise for decentralized exchange protocol dYdX (DYDX), data exchange platform Ocean Protocol (OCEAN) and crypto payments network Request (REQ).\n\nAccording to Santiment, the rise in whale activity signals that a “turnaround becomes much more likely” after a period of price declines.\n\nDYDX is trading at $1.85 at time of writing while OCEAN is changing hands at $0.286.

This will possibly be in parallel with testing efforts on public testnets.\n\ngm, here\'s my writeup of this week\'s Ethereum dev call where devs talked about ongoing issues and bugs on Devnet #9 and had a long debate on the merits of EOF.https://t.co/CbYKBaFlmZ — Christine Kim (@christine_dkim) October 13, 2023\n\nEthereum developers are gearing up for the upcoming release of Devnet #10. According to the article, Devnet #10 might be ready, hopefully next week.\n\nBarnabas Busa, an Ethereum engineer, underlined that developers are still working through "big questions" in the process of testing Dencun.\n\nDevelopers may not proceed with the launch of Devnet #10, likely the final devnet for Dencun, before the upgrade is launched on public Ethereum testnets like Goerli, until these questions are answered.\n\nThe forthcoming Devnet #10 will include a large validator set, maybe with 330,000 active validators. Its launch criteria include updated trusted setup files from the EIP 4844 KZG ceremony, improved visibility for blob transactions, the MEV pipeline and network stability.\n\nThe current Devnet #9 has a 93% participation rate, which means that 93% of validators are actively participating in network consensus. The 7% of invalidators that are not operational are mostly Geth (EL) and Teku (CL) validator nodes.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade contains the eagerly awaited Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, often known as proto-danksharding, which seeks to improve scalability and lower transaction costs on Layer 2 rollup solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism.'}, {'id': 5, 'time': 'Sat, 14 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum losing streak vs. Bitcoin hits 15 months — Can ETH price reverse course? - Cointelegraph', 'content': 'The price of Ethereum’s native token, Ether (ETH), is trading around a 15-month low versus Bitcoin (BTC), and the lowest since Ethereum switched to proof-of-stake (PoS).\n\nWill it continue to weaken for the remainder of 2023?

In doing so, the pair broke below its 200-week exponential moving average (200-week EMA; the blue wave) near 0.058 BTC, raising downside risks further into 2023.\n\nThe 200-week EMA has historically served as a reliable support level for ETH/BTC bulls. For instance, the pair rebounded 75% three months after testing the wave support in July 2022. Conversely, it dropped over 25% after losing the same support in October 2020.\n\nETH/BTC weekly price chart.

On the other hand, Ethereum funds have lost capital, witnessing outflows worth $104 million in the same period.\n\nNet flows into crypto funds (by asset).

In addition, Bitcoin’s fourth halving on April 24, 2024, is also acting as a tailwind versus the altcoin market.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin price gets new $25K target as SEC decision day boosts GBTC\n\nThe halving will reduce the Bitcoin miners’ block reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, a bullish case based on historical precedent that cuts new supply in half.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

But with it still being down significantly from its peak, some enthusiasts are hoping for huge returns in the years ahead.\n\nAs of this writing, Ethereum\'s price is sitting at about $1,500. For it to reach the $5,000 mark, that would translate to a gain of about 230%. Is this even a possible scenario? Let\'s take a closer look at this top digital asset.\n\nIt\'s gotten close\n\nEthereum\'s all-time high price was about $4,892, which was set in November 2021. At that point, the token\'s price skyrocketed 153,000% from its initial launch date in mid-2015. Some lucky early adopters got rich.\n\nBut it\'s worth pointing out that this huge price run-up happened during a major bull market in both the equity markets and the cryptocurrency industry. Monetary policy was still loose after the depths of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nSince then, it\'s been a difficult ride for investors. Ethereum is currently 68% below its peak price. The so-called "crypto winter" was in full effect after a string of companies in the industry failing. Rapidly rising interest rates have also pressured riskier assets.\n\nWhile impossible to predict, investors can\'t ignore macroeconomic factors. They can both positively and negatively influence Ethereum\'s price action.\n\nThe bull case\n\nWithout a doubt, Ethereum has huge potential, according to the most supportive bulls.\n\nThanks to the added functionality and programmability of smart contracts, Ethereum is trying to become the world\'s decentralized computing platform. This blockchain innovation allows for two parties to transact for different use cases without the need for an intermediary. If it gains broader adoption, industries known for having expensive intermediaries are prone to disruption.\n\nSo far, the use cases have included various decentralized applications like financial protocols and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). While activity here has cooled off, developers continue working on trying to make the network better. According to a report by venture firm Electric Capital, Ethereum has 1,901 active developers working on it, significantly more than any other cryptocurrency. This bodes well for its ability to introduce advancements.\n\nSpeaking more to the development aspect, Ethereum\'s Merge upgrade is what many consider to be a positive step, particularly as it relates to scalability. Ethereum can only process 11 transactions per second, and when demand is high, transaction fees can soar.\n\nThe Merge transitioned Ethereum to a proof-of-stake (PoS) system, which can lower energy expenditures and set it up for further scaling enhancements. Future upgrades could add more capabilities to Ethereum. And in turn, this could drive usage and demand for the token, causing its price to rise.\n\nReasons to avoid Ethereum\n\nAs is the case with any unproven asset or new technology, there is a ton of uncertainty around the ultimate outcome.\n\nWith any cryptocurrency, there\'s always inherent technical risk. What happens if there\'s a bug in the software code that exposes private keys? Then everyone\'s crypto holdings can be stolen.\n\nIn Ethereum\'s case, its complex development roadmap introduces the possibility of errors to being made. This means its technical risks are even higher compared to a simpler and more straightforward crypto like Bitcoin.\n\nOne of the biggest bear arguments for Ethereum is that it\'s becoming more centralized, which goes against the entire premise of cryptocurrencies as tools for decentralization and giving power back to the users. The PoS consensus mechanism leads to larger pools of token holders controlling the processing of transactions.\n\nMoreover, a single person, co-founder Vitalik Buterin, has major influence over the direction of Ethereum. He can make decisions to his benefit at the expense of the average Ethereum user. And this can be a detriment to the integrity of the network.\n\nEthereum has promise, but the uncertainty remains sky-high. So I think investors hoping for the token to reach $5,000 should temper expectations. Unless wild enthusiasm takes over the crypto market again, that\'s a very lofty price target to set your eyes on'}]

"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market has been exhibiting a mixed trend with some uncertainty and a slight bearish bias. The MACD signal indicating a sell trend adds to this cautious sentiment. However, the increasing unique addresses and total value transferred suggest growing interest and activity in the market.

On the other hand, the news analyst report paints a bullish outlook for Ethereum, with predictions of significant price increases driven by its dominance in smart contract platforms and emerging use cases. Technical upgrades and upcoming events are also expected to contribute to further growth in the market.

In reflection, it is evident that a conservative approach focused on long-term strategies and risk management has been effective in navigating the uncertain market conditions. While there have been some losses in profit due to the bearish trend, it is crucial to prioritize risk management and capitalize on potential gains over time.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is advisable to adopt a long-term strategy and maintain a cautious approach in trading ETH. The positive market sentiment from the news analyst report may indicate potential growth in the future, but the uncertainty highlighted in the on-chain analyst report suggests the need for careful risk management.

Therefore, my trading action would be to buy ETH with a confidence level of 0.5, indicating a neutral stance with a slight inclination towards the positive market trend projected in the news analyst report. This decision aligns with the emphasis on long-term strategies and risk management to maximize overall profit in the ETH market.

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain, news, and reflection analyst reports, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing mixed trends. The on-chain data indicates a bearish overall trend with intermittent bullish signals, while the news report suggests long-term potential for Ethereum but short-term bearishness for major cryptocurrencies. The reflection report emphasizes the effectiveness of a conservative approach focused on long-term strategies and risk management.

Considering the fluctuating on-chain data, the bearish short-term outlook in the news report, and the emphasis on long-term strategies in the reflection report, it is prudent to prioritize risk management and take a cautious approach in trading ETH. While there may be potential for long-term gains based on the bullish news outlook, the current market conditions suggest volatility and uncertainty in the short term.

Therefore, I would take a conservative approach and assign a trading action of 0.3, indicating moderate confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately. This approach aligns with the recommendation to focus on long-term strategies and risk management to navigate the uncertain ETH market conditions effectively.

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market has been experiencing fluctuations in open prices, total value transferred, and average gas prices. The MACD signal has been indicating a sell trend, but the overall trend seems to be leaning towards a buy signal based on increasing total value transferred and successful transactions. The market remains volatile, requiring further analysis to confirm the trend.

The news analyst report highlights positive developments such as the listing of Ethereum Express on LBank Exchange and the approval of Upland's utility token Spark for trading on Ethereum. These developments suggest a growing interest in Ethereum-based tokens, potentially leading to increased trading activity and liquidity in the market. Additionally, the focus on staking rewards in the Ethereum ETF space indicates a shift towards more sophisticated investment products, attracting investors seeking additional returns and network participation.

The reflection analyst report emphasizes the effectiveness of a conservative approach focused on long-term strategies and risk management in navigating uncertain market conditions. It underscores the importance of analyzing on-chain data, news reports, and reflection analyses to gain valuable insights into market trends and opportunities. The report suggests prioritizing risk management and closely monitoring key indicators to capitalize on long-term gains in the ETH market.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is evident that the ETH market is showing signs of positive growth and potential for increased trading activity and liquidity. The emphasis on long-term strategies and risk management aligns with the current market conditions, which are characterized by volatility and mixed trends.

So, it’s not beyond the realm of possibilities at all.\n\nBut what’s even more strange is we got above the 10% threshold already in the past.\n\nThis is the SOL upside chart… You can see here the yellow line is the 10% of ETH market cap, and the Solana price in blue breached that back in October 2021.”\n\nAt time of writing, SOL is trading for $21.99.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Despite this descent, the appearance of a few green candles at this support level suggests that buyers are attempting to rally and set the stage for a potential recovery.\n\nAlso Read: What Should Ethereum Investors Do Amid Bullish Call for $8000 ETH Price?\n\nadvertisement\n\nWill Buyers Regain the $1700 Mark\n\nThe crypto buyers could witness high demand pressure around $1500\n\nThe Ethereum fear and greed index at 41% indicates neutral to bearish sentiment in the market\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $2.2 Billion, indicating a 34% loss.\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nThe short-term trend in Ethereum coin price is currently sideways with its price wobbling between two horizontal levels of $1745 to $1530. With the recent downturn in the crypto market, the ETH price has dropped to the bottom support of the aforementioned range.\n\nOn October 13th, the buyers tried to rebound from this support but could not push the price above the $1573 level. Today, with an insignificant intraday loss of 0.05%, the daily candle shows uncertainty among market participants.\n\nTherefore, for traders to gain a better confirmation of a bullish reversal, the price should surpass the October 13th high of $1573. Under the influence of this range pattern formation, this bullish reversal should surge the prices 12.4% higher to rechallenge the $1745 mark.\n\nWill ETH Price Break Below $1500 Mark\n\nWhile the ETH price struggle to bounce back from the $1,530 mark suggests tepid bullish sentiment, a further slip below this support could find immediate support around the $1,500 level, which aligns with a longstanding trendline. This trendline forms the lower boundary of a rising channel pattern that has historically guided this altcoin’s recovery phases for nearly 500 days. Should market participants continue to respect this pattern, the Ethereum coin could find a footing at $1,500, aiming for a more ambitious target above the last significant swing high of $2,138.\n\nRelative Strength Index: Despite the sideways action, the daily RSI slope rising with a pair for new higher highs and lows reflects the buyers.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThe recent behavior of Ethereum (ETH) on the market and its deflation have gathered the attention of many crypto traders and investors. Since December 2022, the supply of Ether has been on an upward trajectory. Several factors have contributed to this inflationary trend in Ethereum. Notably, the decreased transaction fees, paired with an increased daily issuance, have accelerated the rise in ETH\'s supply.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe provided graphical representation highlights Ethereum\'s deflationary trend, juxtaposed with its network activity. An analysis of this chart brings forth some striking revelations. The burn rate is currently at 402K ETH per year, indicating that while transactions are ongoing and fees are being paid, a significant portion of Ether is being destroyed or "burned" but it is still not enough.\n\nOn the other hand, the supply growth shows an increase of 0.36% over a 30-day time frame. Moreover, the issuance sits at 834K ETH per year, which underscores the increasing creation of new Ether in the ecosystem.\n\nHowever, even with these factors pushing Ethereum toward an inflationary stance, it is crucial to note that the net issuance for Ethereum stands at a mere 0.44% annually. When juxtaposed with Bitcoin\'s inflation rate, Ethereum\'s figure is still considerably lower.\n\nFrom a pricing perspective, Ethereum has recently faced some challenges. The cryptocurrency has seen a retreat below the $1,600 mark, sparking concerns among investors and traders. With the current trajectory, Ethereum\'s price is inching closer to the critical $1,400 support level, which historically played a pivotal role in March as a point of trend reversal.\n\nFor now, Ethereum\'s price movement indicates downward pressure. While it is showing some resilience around the $1,575 zone, the continuous testing of this support suggests a potential breakdown. If ETH fails to maintain this stance, the road toward the $1,400 mark might be its next destination.'}, {'id': 7, 'time': 'Sun, 15 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Can Ethereum (ETH) price rebound next week? - Finbold - Finance in Bold', 'content': 'Ethereum’s (ETH) value has experienced another decline this week, dropping to $1,557. This represents a 5% decline over the course of a week that has generally seen negative trends in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nETH last 7 days performance.

However, it’s important to note that despite recent setbacks, the market’s top altcoin has still managed to maintain a year-to-date increase of 29.6%.\n\nEthereum’s situation remains somewhat mixed, but recent overselling may position the asset for a potential rebound in the coming weeks, particularly when considering the fundamental strength of the Ethereum network, and the potential inflow of investors.\n\nIs the bearish trend set to continue?\n\nEthereum’s price has been on a downward trajectory for a couple of months, showing significant weakness in its indicators since mid-August, coinciding with a broader market downturn.\n\nThe relative strength index (RSI) for ETH, represented by the purple line, has dropped from nearly 70 at the beginning of the month to 35 today. Although there has been a slight uptick in the past few hours, it remains weak, indicating that the token is currently oversold.\n\nA similar situation can be observed with ETH’s 30-day exponential moving average (EMA) in yellow, which continues to slide further below its 200-day average (blue). This emphasizes the presence of substantial selling pressure.\n\nOne of the most discouraging signals at present is the decline in the token’s support level, denoted by the green line, over the past few days. This suggests that ETH may struggle to resist further declines in the coming days.\n\nETH last 2 months performance. Source: TradingView\n\nHowever, despite the potential for minor drops in the very near future, the fact that ETH has been heavily sold recently makes it likely that traders will eventually seize the opportunity to purchase the token at an attractive discount.\n\nIn fact, ETH is currently undervalued relative to its underlying fundamentals, making it a favorable time to invest in the cryptocurrency, which is expected to make a full recovery, particularly given its dominant position in the crypto ecosystem.\n\nEthereum maintains a significant share of the Total Value Locked (TVL) in the industry, with its network and major layer-twos like Optimism (OP), Polygon (Matic), Arbitrum (ARB), and Base accounting for approximately 63% of the sector’s total TVL.\n\nEthereum also continues to evolve and expand, as evidenced by the upcoming launch of the Holesky testnet, a development that will contribute to Ethereum’s progress toward the eventual implementation of Proto-Danksharding, which promises significant improvements in scalability.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

However, historical trends show the tides could be changing soon, with Ethereum possibly on the brink of entering an accumulation phase.\n\nEthereum Price Action\n\nEthereum is trading at $1600, marking a 22% decrease from its price last August. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is 8% up over the same period.\n\nThis is a common trend that happens during bear markets. Coins with larger market capitalizations tend to be more resilient against price decreases as investors become more risk-averse and look to preserve their capital. While Ethereum isn’t short at a market capitalization of $187 billion, it’s still considerably lower than Bitcoin at $525 billion.\n\nDuring bull markets, coins with lower market capitalization outperform Bitcoin again as investors lean towards assets with greater potential returns.\n\nEthereum Price Compared Against Bitcoin\n\nWhen comparing ETH’s value to BTC, it’s evident that Ethereum has been trading within a descending channel since last August. This pattern, characterized by its lower highs and lower lows, often indicates a bearish trend in the market.\n\nETH's valuation against BTC over time. Source: ETHBTC on TradingView\n\nThe chart above highlights three other distinct phases:\n\nAccumulation phase: During this phase, price tends to stabilize, hinting at an upcoming change in momentum\n\nAscending channel: Here, the price experiences a significant reversal, often on a parabolic trajectory, characterized by highs and higher lows.\n\nDistribution phase: In the final phase, the price ceases its upward movement. Investors typically use this phase to capitalize on their gains and liquidate their positions.\n\nThe accumulation phase is typically the best time for investors to convert their Bitcoin into Ethereum. This phase is marked by price holding on at the bottom and then showing signs of reversal. Ethereum is still forming lower lows against Bitcoin, so it has not entered the accumulation phase yet. However, the last cycle shows that this could be changing soon.\n\nLast Cycle\n\nReflecting on the last cycle, Ethereum was in a descending channel against Bitcoin for 17 months. The accumulation phase then occurred from September 2019 up until February 2020. Based on the four-year theory, which suggests similar phases in the market occur every four years, this shows that the accumulation phase should also be approaching very soon in this cycle.\n\nYet, while the last cycle offers valuable insights, it’s important to note that no two cycles are the same. In the current cycle, ETH’s price action has not seen as much of a drop as in the previous cycle, which could be attributed to changing fundamentals and asset maturation.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nWhile an accumulation phase for Ethereum has not been confirmed yet, there remains the potential for its price to drop even further relative to Bitcoin. However, if the previous cycle is anything to go by, we could enter the accumulation phase soon. This phase typically presents prime buying opportunities for Ethereum.\n\nInvestment Disclaimer: The content provided in this article is for informational and educational purposes only.

"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain, news, and reflection analyst reports, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing mixed trends. The on-chain data indicates a bearish overall trend with intermittent bullish signals, while the news report suggests long-term potential for Ethereum but short-term bearishness for major cryptocurrencies. The reflection report emphasizes the effectiveness of a conservative approach focused on long-term strategies and risk management.

Considering the fluctuating on-chain data, the bearish short-term outlook in the news report, and the emphasis on long-term strategies in the reflection report, it is prudent to prioritize risk management and take a cautious approach in trading ETH. While there may be potential for long-term gains based on the bullish news outlook, the current market conditions suggest volatility and uncertainty in the short term.

Therefore, I would take a conservative approach and assign a trading action of 0.3, indicating moderate confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately. This approach aligns with the recommendation to focus on long-term strategies and risk management to navigate the uncertain ETH market conditions effectively.
ACTION:
0.3
DAILY RETURN:
0.005398362565753878
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market has been experiencing fluctuations in open prices, total value transferred, and average gas prices. The MACD signal has been indicating a sell trend, but the overall trend seems to be leaning towards a buy signal based on increasing total value transferred and successful transactions. The market remains volatile, requiring further analysis to confirm the trend.

The news analyst report highlights positive developments such as the listing of Ethereum Express on LBank Exchange and the approval of Upland's utility token Spark for trading on Ethereum. These developments suggest a growing interest in Ethereum-based tokens, potentially leading to increased trading activity and liquidity in the market. Additionally, the focus on staking rewards in the Ethereum ETF space indicates a shift towards more sophisticated investment products, attracting investors seeking additional returns and network participation.

The reflection analyst report emphasizes the effectiveness of a conservative approach focused on long-term strategies and risk management in navigating uncertain market conditions. It underscores the importance of analyzing on-chain data, news reports, and reflection analyses to gain valuable insights into market trends and opportunities. The report suggests prioritizing risk management and closely monitoring key indicators to capitalize on long-term gains in the ETH market.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is evident that the ETH market is showing signs of positive growth and potential for increased trading activity and liquidity. The emphasis on long-term strategies and risk management aligns with the current market conditions, which are characterized by volatility and mixed trends. Therefore, it is advisable to adopt a conservative trading approach to mitigate risks and maximize overall profit in the ETH market.

Based on the analysis, I would take a trading action with a confidence level of 0.7, indicating a moderate level of confidence in the market trend. This decision reflects a strategic approach to managing risk appropriately and prioritizing long-term gains over short-term fluctuations.
ACTION:
0.7
DAILY RETURN:
0.0016220925543810605
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing volatility with a potential bullish trend indicated by the MACD signal switching from sell to buy. The increase in total value transferred and fluctuating number of unique addresses and successful transactions suggest mixed sentiment among traders.

The news analyst report further supports this mixed sentiment, highlighting both bullish indicators such as rising whale activity on altcoins and concerns such as Ethereum's price performance against Bitcoin hitting a 15-month low. The market trend for Ethereum appears uncertain, with potential for both bullish and bearish movements depending on various factors.

In reflection, it is evident that a conservative approach focused on long-term strategies and risk management has been effective in navigating the volatile ETH market. By prioritizing long-term gains and managing risk appropriately, traders can capitalize on potential growth opportunities while mitigating risks.

Considering the synthesized reports and emphasizing long-term strategies over short-term gains, it is advisable to maintain a cautious stance in trading ETH. Therefore, my trading action would be to buy ETH with a confidence level of 0.5, indicating a moderate confidence in the potential bullish trend but also acknowledging the market's volatility and the importance of managing risk.

Bitcoin was up 3.8% at $27,909, while Ethereum was above the $1,550 level.Meanwhile, the global cryptocurrency market cap surged 2.6% to around $1.08 trillion in the last 24 hours."BTC and ETH both showed positive gains over the weekend, driven by the news that the SEC won\'t appeal the court decision regarding Grayscale\'s spot Bitcoin ETF application. This news has sparked the interest of investors, as it raises the likelihood of a BTC spot ETF approval by the end of the first quarter of 2024," said CoinDCX Research Team.Meanwhile, Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead at CoinSwitch Ventures, said, "In a positive development that underlines the crypto adoption, Ferrari - a well-renowned car manufacturer will now accept crypto as a payment method for its luxury cars in the U.S. To execute this, the company has partnered with BitPay wherein payments will be accepted in BTC, ETH, and USDC. As part of its expansion plans, this payment method will soon be available in Europe as well."In today\'s trade, other crypto tokens were also trading higher. Solana and Tron rose up to 3%, while Toncoin, XRP, BNB, Litecoin, and Polkadot surged up to 2%.In the last 24 hours, the market cap of Bitcoin, the world\'s largest cryptocurrency, surged to $544 billion. Bitcoin\'s dominance is currently 50.3%, according to CoinMarketCap. BTC volume in the last 24 hours increased 120.4% to $10.94 billion.Bitcoin has been locked in a trading range between moving averages recently, reflecting uncertainty and a standoff between bullish and bearish sentiment regarding its next price movement. Such tight consolidations often precede significant price swings.However, Bitcoin didn\'t favoured the bulls last week, with its price on track to close with a more than 3% loss. This downward pressure, coupled with regulatory concerns, has contributed to a reduced interest in Altcoins among crypto investors. Consequently, Bitcoin\'s market dominance has remained near the 50% mark.Bitcoin after testing the crucial support level of $25,000 (Horizontal Trendline & 50% Fibonacci Retracement Level) has witnessed a relief rally and the prices went up almost by 14% to $28,580. The bulls failed to manage their grip on the asset as BTC resisted at $28,500 and corrected to $26,538. Over the past four days, the asset has been trading in a narrow range from $26,550 to $27,250 with low volumes. BTC has strong support at $25,000 and strong resistance at $32,500.

A Beginner's Guide - Unchained - Unchained", 'content': 'Wrapped Ethereum (ETH) enables ETH holders to wrap their tokens and use them in Ethereum’s decentralized finance market in accordance with the ERC-20 token standard.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain’s native cryptocurrency, ether (ETH), follows different rules from those of the ERC-20 token standard. Wrapped Ethereum helps bridge this gap by offering a more versatile version of ETH.\n\nRead on as we discuss Wrapped Ethereum, how to wrap and unwrap ETH, and the various use cases.\n\nWhat Is Wrapped Ethereum (WETH)?\n\nWrapped Ethereum (WETH) is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain pegged 1:1 to ETH.\n\nETH plays a critical role in the network by paying gas fees for transactions. However, with ERC-20 tokens following different rules, users cannot use their ETH in the same way as ERC-20 tokens.\n\nWETH’s ERC-20 infrastructure opens this path, allowing compatibility across the blockchain and eliminating the need to develop new smart contracts.\n\nHow Does Wrapped Ethereum Work?\n\nETH preceded the development of the ERC-20 standard, and the lack of compatibility means customized programming for each dApp, which can be costly. With the wrapping technology, an ERC-20 wrapper envelopes the ETH. This eliminates the need for custom programming to ensure compatibility with ERC-20 contracts.\n\nHere’s how you can wrap your ETH, turning it into WETH:\n\nSend the desired amount of ETH to a WETH smart contract.\n\nThe smart contract then returns equal WETH and locks your ETH.\n\nUse the WETH for investment purposes such as providing liquidity , lending, staking, NFT trading, and much more.\n\nWhen you want your ETH back, send the WETH to the smart contract, unlocking your ETH and sending it to your wallet.\n\nThe smart contract then automatically burns the WETH to ensure the 1:1 peg remains.\n\nInstead of exchanging the WETH for your ETH, you can also use a crypto exchange such as Uniswap or SushiSwap to swap it for another token or cryptocurrency.\n\nBenefits & Drawbacks for WETH\n\nWETH presents two key advantages:\n\nDeploy ETH in DeFi: ETH holders can deploy their holdings in decentralized protocols incompatible with ETH. Wrapped ETH presents an ERC-20 version of Ethereum that the holders can use to trade and lend in various DeFi protocols, for example.\n\nNo need to sell ETH: Investments are possible without losing access to ether holdings. Since investors can retrieve the ETH locked in the smart contract at any time, they don’t have to sell their holdings for investment and trading purposes.\n\nThere are some risks associated with WETH:\n\nThe need to trust a third party : The protocol for wrapping Ethereum is not Turing-complete. That means automation via a smart contract on the blockchain is not possible. Centralized programs host the wrapping smart contracts, allowing certain parties to control the assets. This opens the door for potential manipulation and abuse of power.\n\nTarget for hackers : The centralized nature of the WETH smart contracts incentivizes bad actors to exploit any existing vulnerabilities since all the assets are in one place.\n\nWrapped Ethereum Use Cases\n\nThere are two key use cases for WETH:\n\nLiquidity Pools : On decentralized exchanges such as UniSwap, users can add their WETH to liquidity pools and earn fees. The fees come from other users who opt to swap their tokens.\n\nLending : Platforms such as AAVE offer collateralized crypto loans. You can lend your WETH to other users and earn interest. You can recall your assets at any time, provided the smart contract for the lending agreement allows it.\n\nWrapped Ethereum on Other Blockchains\n\nSo far, we have only mentioned the Ethereum blockchain, which may leave you wondering if you can wrap ETH on other blockchains. At its core, wrapping technology aims to achieve interoperability. Therefore, it is possible to wrap Ethereum outside the native blockchain.\n\nBlockchains such as Polygon, Avalanche, and BNB Chain contain different versions of wrapped ETH.\n\nBlockchain bridging services\n\ncan also enhance cross-chain interoperability. A smart contract stores the ETH on the native blockchain and then mints an equivalent amount on the destination blockchain. The bridging process has its risks, with the key being the vulnerability of the smart contracts. Ensure you have all the information about the bridging service you intend to use before risking your ETH.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWrapped Ethereum provides a user-friendly way to bridge Ethereum’s native token and the blockchain ERC-20 token standard, enabling ETH to be used in wrapped form across the entire dApp ecosystem on Ethereum.'}, {'id': 25, 'time': 'Mon, 16 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Spike As False BlackRock ETF Rumor Sparks $104M Shorts Liquidation: Analyst Says ... - Nasdaq', 'content': 'Major cryptocurrencies experienced a significant surge on Monday evening, triggered by a false rumor on X, claiming that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had approved BlackRock’s (NYSE:BLK) spot bitcoin ETF application.\n\nCryptocurrency Gains +/- Price (Recorded 9:30 p.m. EDT) Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) +4.21% $28,393 Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) +1.97% $1,593 Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) +0.81% $0.060\n\nWhat Happened: On Monday, BlackRock, an investment management firm, provided an update regarding its ETF application for the iShares Spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nA BlackRock spokesperson told Benzinga that a decision on the application has not yet been made, and it is still under review by the SEC.\n\nThis news has had an immediate impact on Bitcoin, as its value quickly declined to around $28,000\n\nWhile the rumor may not have had a real impact, the financial implications were tangible.

ETH is now struggling to clear the $1,605 and $1,620 resistance levels.\n\nEthereum is attempting a recovery wave above the $1,570 level.\n\nThe price is trading just above $1,575 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $1,572 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could rise further if there is a close above the $1,620 resistance level.\n\nEthereum Price Gains Traction\n\nEthereum started a fresh increase from the $1,520 level. ETH gained traction like Bitcoin and spiked above the $1,600 resistance level. It even climbed above $1,620, but the bears appeared near $1,650.\n\nA high was formed near $1,669 before there was a fresh decline. Ether trimmed gains and settled below the $1,600 level. It tested the $1,575 support and is currently consolidating near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,669 swing high to the $1,574 low.\n\nEthereum is now trading just above $1,575 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $1,572 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nOn the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $1,605 level. The first major resistance is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,669 swing high to the $1,574 low at $1,620. A close above the $1,620 resistance might start a decent increase.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nIn the stated case, Ether could rise and recover toward the $1,665 resistance. Any more gains might open the doors for a move toward $1,750.\n\nAnother Decline in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,605 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,575 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThe next key support is $1,550. A downside break below the $1,550 support might send the price further lower. In the stated case, the price could drop toward the $1,520 level. Any more losses may perhaps send Ether toward the $1,440 level.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level – $1,575\n\nMajor Resistance Level – $1,620\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing volatility with a potential bullish trend indicated by the MACD signal switching from sell to buy. The increase in total value transferred and fluctuating number of unique addresses and successful transactions suggest mixed sentiment among traders.

The news analyst report further supports this mixed sentiment, highlighting both bullish indicators such as rising whale activity on altcoins and concerns such as Ethereum's price performance against Bitcoin hitting a 15-month low. The market trend for Ethereum appears uncertain, with potential for both bullish and bearish movements depending on various factors.

In reflection, it is evident that a conservative approach focused on long-term strategies and risk management has been effective in navigating the volatile ETH market. By prioritizing long-term gains and managing risk appropriately, traders can capitalize on potential growth opportunities while mitigating risks.

Considering the synthesized reports and emphasizing long-term strategies over short-term gains, it is advisable to maintain a cautious stance in trading ETH. Therefore, my trading action would be to buy ETH with a confidence level of 0.5, indicating a moderate confidence in the potential bullish trend but also acknowledging the market's volatility and the importance of managing risk.
ACTION:
0.5
DAILY RETURN:
0.0011977118482042748
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that ETH has been experiencing a bullish trend with increasing open prices, active network usage, growing interest, and participation in the market. The MACD signal consistently showing a buy trend further supports the positive outlook for ETH.

On the other hand, the news analyst report presents a more mixed outlook, with conflicting predictions on ETH's price target and potential bearish movements. The uncertainty in the market is highlighted by the inflationary trend of Ethereum compared to Bitcoin's deflation and the possibility of an accumulation phase against Bitcoin.

In reflection of my recent trading performance, it is evident that a conservative approach focusing on long-term strategies and risk management has been effective in navigating the volatile ETH market. By analyzing on-chain data, news reports, and reflecting on past trades, I have been able to make informed decisions and capitalize on growth opportunities while managing risks effectively.

Considering the mixed sentiment in the market and the potential for both bullish and bearish movements, it is important to prioritize long-term gains over short-term gains. Therefore, I would recommend a cautious trading approach with a moderate level of confidence to navigate the uncertainty and volatility in the cryptocurrency market effectively.

Based on the synthesized reports and my strategic decision to manage risk appropriately, I would take a trading action with a confidence level of 0.5, indicating a neutral stance in the market trend. This decision reflects my commitment to long-term strategies and risk management in maximizing overall profit in ETH trading.

REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH cryptocurrency has been experiencing a positive trend with consistent network activity and healthy transaction levels. The MACD signal remaining at a buy further supports a positive market outlook. The news analyst report also reinforces this sentiment, highlighting positive developments in the cryptocurrency market, particularly for Bitcoin and Ethereum. The bullish trend indicated by the increase in market cap and the potential for further growth are encouraging signs for ETH traders.

In reflecting on the reports and considering the current market conditions, it is evident that a conservative approach focusing on long-term strategies and risk management is the most effective way to navigate the volatile ETH market. By prioritizing long-term gains and managing risk appropriately, traders can capitalize on growth opportunities while mitigating risks associated with market fluctuations.

Therefore, the clear market trend for ETH is bullish with potential for further growth in the long term. To maximize overall profit and navigate the uncertainty and volatility in the market, a more conservative trading approach is warranted.

Drawing insights from a report by Odaily news, the discourse ranged from technical advancements to acknowledgments of decentralized projects, weaving a narrative of Ethereum’s evolving landscape.\n\nForemost, Buterin delved into the intricacies of quantum resistance—a burgeoning concern in the blockchain community given the potential of quantum computing to challenge existing cryptographic systems. He discussed the role of account abstraction, specifically through Ethereum’s proposal ERC-4337.\n\nThis initiative, according to Buterin, can imbue users’ accounts with quantum-resistant properties, fortifying Ethereum against future threats posed by quantum computers. Such a development underscores the proactive approach the Ethereum community is taking to ensure the blockchain’s continued security and relevance.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin calls for privacy and decentralization\n\nBeyond the technical realm, Buterin also spotlighted some decentralized projects that exemplify innovation and impact within the Ethereum ecosystem.

PoolTogether, a no-loss lottery system built on Ethereum (ETH), similarly caught Buterin’s attention. This unique model lets users pool funds, earn interest and stand a chance to win prizes—a testament to the creative possibilities of blockchain technology.\n\nOn a more personal tangent, Buterin expressed his admiration for several cities around the globe. Singapore, Taipei, Vienna, Toronto and the New York State’s City of Ithaca made the list, each resonating with Buterin for their distinctive mix of technological innovation and cultural vibrancy.\n\nIn wrapping up, the insights from Buterin’s AMA serve as a compelling indicator of Ethereum’s forward momentum, with an emphasis on both technological foresight and the value of innovative decentralized projects.\n\nFollow Us on Google News'}, {'id': 6, 'time': 'Wed, 18 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Crypto Bull Scaramucci Sees 3X Gains For Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Algorand — Here's Why - Nasdaq", 'content': "SkyBridge Capital founder, Anthony Scaramucci has shed a bullish light on the future price trajectories of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), and Algorand (CRYPTO: ALGO), suggesting hearty targets for these cryptocurrencies, detailing the intrinsic factors that could drive such a bullish trend.\n\nThis optimistic outlook comes just ahead of Benzinga's Future of Digital Assets conference on Nov. 14, which aims to delve into the evolving dynamics of digital assets. Discussions about these predictions by Scaramucci could form a riveting part of the narrative as industry experts explore the potential future of cryptocurrencies.\n\nScaramucci postulates a bullish scenario for Bitcoin, attributing his confidence to the post-halving cycle which historically propels a surge in demand, in an interview with Altcoin Daily.\n\nHe states, “I believe six to 12 months after the halving cycle, there’s no reason why Bitcoin couldn’t be at $100,000. Just given what I know about demand and given what I know about the cycle and where the miners are, and so forth, plus, we may get some interest rate relief.

These things are maturing.”\n\nHis optimism extends to Algorand, albeit with a tempered tone due to its current trading price. Despite the crypto’s present modest trading range of around $0.09 to $0.10, Scaramucci sees potential for growth.\n\nHe envisions a path to $0.30 per token as Algorand continues to develop and garner adoption, especially from corporations enamored by its technology.\n\nHe adds, “I’m bullish. I thought at $1 it could have easily gotten to $5... but could Algorand from here... could it be a $0.30 token as they continue their development and continue the adoption of what they’re doing and bringing in corporations that love the technology?

The restaked tokens can then help secure and validate other protocols.\n\nProponents believe restaking can squeeze additional security and rewards from already staked ETH and grow the crypto ecosystem in a healthier way based on Ethereum’s existing trust mechanisms. Restaking could serve as a security primitive for exporting Ethereum’s trust generated by its validators to other projects.\n\nYet Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and a number of key devs worry that restaking is a house of cards that will inevitably tumble. Some of those Ethereum devs have even proposed a fork to head off restaking platform EigenLayer.\n\nWhy the project’s founders promote “trust as a service” from Ethereum without the Ethereum founder and others’ willingness to participate is still to play out. Will the whole concept result in an Ethereum fork to protect the network from catastrophic failure?\n\nThe way eth Community turned on EigenLayer should be studied, it’s not for building, just side @BanklessHQ deals with canto n other grifters, we gonna keep forking yall ideas tho on other non zuzalu shit https://t.co/7Erh6qKVSE — ⟠yumatrades.eth⟠ – #6585 (😈,😇) (@yumatrades) May 22, 2023\n\nStaking and restaking\n\nStaking is a crypto-native concept. On Ethereum, it means putting up a security bond in ETH so that the validator (validators of new transactions who maintain the security of the blockchain) will behave honestly in verifying transactions rather than lose their staked tokens. Stakers are then paid rewards for locking up this ETH.\n\nIn essence, stakers lock up their tokens to commit to producing Ethereum blocks — an on-chain way of supporting development, regardless of fluctuations in highly volatile token prices.\n\nSo what is restaking?\n\nIn short, restaking works in that already staked Ethereum tokens can be rehypothecated (when a lender re-uses collateral posted from one loan to take out a new loan) to secure a wider variety of applications and accrue additional rewards.\n\nBut restakers also get penalized or slashed for non-performance of their staking tasks. (More on that below).\n\nSo restaking is a crypto primitive for generating economic security from Ethereum’s nine years of concerted developer activity and project track record.\n\n“It’s an extension protocol to extend what Ethereum can do, scaling out Ethereum stakers beyond Ethereum to other bridges and oracles that need to be secured,” EigenLayer founder Sreeram Kannan tells Magazine.\n\n\n\nHe says EigenLayer is commoditizing ETH staking to make it more general purpose, as, in crypto parlance, “staking is the root of trust.”\n\nKannan is an academic on leave from the University of Washington, and EigenLayer began as academic research into “exported trust” as a consensus protocol. Basically, he sought to piggyback the trust generated by Ethereum to other ecosystems.\n\nKannan essentially seeks to export the “trust” generated by Ethereum for other projects across the ecosystem and other chains. “In crypto, mechanisms for trust mean that investors need skin in the game. The pseudonymous world needs carrots and sticks whereby validators are distributed.” He calls it “permissionless innovation.”\n\nThe best each chain has to offer\n\nThe big idea for EigenLayer is to bridge blockchains and create super applications, taking the best each chain has to offer. Kannan says “every ecosystem is better in some dimension, but not all dimensions,” and EigenLayer enhancing decentralized tech stacks will actually benefit the industry.\n\nKannan said that what can be built with EigenLayer fits roughly into two categories.\n\n\n\nFirstly, EigenLayer allows for the construction of bridges from chain to chain, say Ethereum to Avalanche. EigenLayer acts as a marketplace for “decentralized trust,” connecting stakers seeking yields, projects built on EigenLayer offering risk-reward structures for yields, and operators acting as bridges between stakers and projects.\n\nSecondly, a set of smart contracts on Ethereum’s chain lets ETH stakers opt to run other software. EigenLayer could, for example, improve Ethereum transaction finality speeds. ETH stakers can now take the layer-1 blockchain Fantom chain (for better transaction finality times) and fork it on EigenLayer, thereby running a layer as a super fast finalization layer with an EigenLayer trust layer.\n\nBut it’s all still theoretical.\n\nThe idea of restaking makes sense theoretically, helping projects build off Ethereum’s security layer — but the problems worry many.\n\nIn theory, “it’s like the NATO security alliance; each country is still a sovereign country, but their mutual defense pact is secured by the sum of their military power,” Sunny Aggarwal, co-founder of Osmosis Labs and creator of a ...'}]

As of this writing, the token's price is up more than 52,000% since its public launch in July 2015.\n\nThat's an impressive gain, but it hasn't been a smooth ride for investors. Ethereum currently sits 68% off its all-time high price, set in November 2021.\n\nIs it smart to buy this top cryptocurrency while it's still below $2,000? Let's look at the reasons both for and against this decision.\n\nBuying the dip could be a smart move\n\nThe obvious reason to be a buyer right now is how beaten-down Ethereum's price is. During the huge bull run in 2021, crypto markets drew a lot of enthusiasm from the investment community looking for quick profits. Things certainly look to have been in bubble territory. In the years since, there has been a bit of a normalization, which might be a good thing.\n\nRapidly rising interest rates crushed the stock and crypto markets in 2022. And it introduced a prolonged market downturn in digital assets, even though Ethereum has climbed this year.\n\nAll else equal, investing in something when its price is lower is a better move. Should things still play out as hoped, the upside is greater than if you had bought at a higher price. This could be the situation with Ethereum right now.\n\nSome investors are bullish on Ethereum for its game-changing potential, primarily in the world of decentralized applications (dApps). That this blockchain has capabilities to build smart contracts has caused many believers to see a lot of use cases developing over time.\n\nWhile the activity around decentralized finance protocols and non-fungible tokens has cooled off, Ethereum remains the leader in these innovations. Thus, when the market rebounds, as it has done in the past, demand for the blockchain could soar once again with a growing dApp ecosystem.\n\nEthereum's transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism 13 months ago might have won over a lot of people. This move reduced the network's energy usage by more than 99%, which will certainly go over well with climate activists. It paves the way for a more sustainable future.\n\nEthereum is too risky\n\nThere are also some clear reasons not to buy Ethereum -- despite its price being below $2,000 at the moment. Cryptocurrencies might simply be way too volatile for some investors. This issue is more of a concern for those who are near or in retirement. Owning Ethereum exposes the portfolio to wild valuation swings, which could be too hard to stomach.\n\nSome naysayers might also argue that there isn't even a need for Ethereum. In other words, it's a solution looking for a problem to solve.\n\nTake financial services, for example. DeFi promises to remove intermediaries, which might lead to better consumer pricing and rates. But as we've seen with the failures of major crypto firms, things are opaque and too complex to understand. For all its faults, the current financial system is adequate for most people, and that could eliminate the demand for DeFi services.\n\nEthereum faces regulatory uncertainty, too. Is it a security? If the Securities and Exchange Commission one day rules that it is, that means Ethereum will have to abide by comprehensive reporting requirements. And this could result in heightened public scrutiny of the crypto.\n\nThere's even a possibility that Ethereum won't get back to its all-time high ever. The euphoria that characterized the market in 2021 might be a one-hit wonder.\n\nOn one hand, I can see why some investors might be interested in starting a tiny position in Ethereum, primarily as a result of its potential. But I'm in the camp that says it's better to probably be a bit more critical and avoid the crypto altogether or await further developments."}]

It claims assets — including its web3 wallet MetaMask, partly developed by some of the plaintiffs — were transferred out of Consensys AG, leaving them with worthless shares.\n\nLubin allegedly arranged to move the assets to a new U.S.-based company, CSI, in 2020, so it could solicit outside investment, with the help of Consensys General Counsel Matt Corva, enabling Lubin to replace the plaintiffs with Wall Street investors.\n\nLubin also brought in investment bank JPMorgan, who, in exchange for its own blockchain business, Quorum, received 10% of CSI, according to the complaint. Corva, JPMorgan and Umar Farooq, Global Head of Blockchain at JPMorgan, are also listed as defendants.\n\n'He broke his word'\n\nWhen Lubin established Consensys in 2014, many employees accepted lower salaries with the understanding they would receive company equity, according to the suit. Lubin reportedly dedicated 30% of the company to employee stock, with the suing party holding about 9% of that portion.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nLegal representatives for the former employees argue that while Lubin prospered, those who believed in his early vision and accepted stock over higher pay ended up with empty promises. “He broke his word,” the lawyers wrote. “In the process, he violated his legal commitments and duties. While Lubin got rich, plaintiffs got nothing.”\n\n“Plaintiffs in an ongoing shareholder case against the Swiss-based web3 incubator and investor Consensys AG, which operates as Consensys Mesh, have just filed suit against U.S. blockchain software developer Consensys Software Inc. in New York state court,” a Consensys spokesperson told The Block via email.\n\n“After two years of getting nowhere with their frivolous claims against Consensys Mesh in a Swiss court, plaintiffs now believe their meritless claims stand a better chance of yielding a pay day if they game U.S. courts and entangle Consensys Software and other unrelated parties in litigation,” the spokesperson added. “We fully expect that the plaintiffs, who were never employees of Consensys Software, will soon find this gambit is another fruitless attempt to enrich themselves from the success of others.”\n\nCSI has raised at least $726.7 million from investors, according to the suit, with its valuation rising to more than $7 billion following Series D financing."}, {'id': 8, 'time': 'Fri, 20 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum network fees hit 2023 lows, on-chain activities rise - crypto.news', 'content': 'Ethereum network fees are currently at their lowest point in 2023.\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) blockchain witnessed a significant reduction in network fees, with users paying a mere $1.15 per transaction, Santiment data shows. The current decline in Ethereum’s transaction fees carries with it a historical pattern that bodes well for the network’s utility.\n\nAs transaction fees drop, Ethereum becomes a cheaper choice for users to interact with its versatile platform. This development holds the promise of boosting Ethereum’s overall market value.\n\nLately, there has been a notable rise in the level of on-chain transactions within the Ethereum network. The figure, totaling 1,089,893 user active wallets (UAW), marks the second-highest activity level in Ethereum’s history. Blockchain analysts at Santiment noted that such spikes in on-chain activity could be a signal for potential price rebounds.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum unveils new testnet called ‘Holešky’\n\nThis increased activity suggests growing interest and utility in the Ethereum network, which may positively impact its market capitalization in the coming months.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1705401195152789888\n\nWhile the wider cryptocurrency landscape sees significant price dips, Ethereum has remained above the $1,500 mark.\n\nIn June, analysts expressed optimism in the world’s second-largest crypto, with some predicting Ethereum’s ascent to a historic high of $3,000. What fuels this bullish sentiment is the remarkable dwindling of ETH reserves on exchanges, plunging to an unprecedented low of 12.6%.\n\nThis scarcity of Ethereum in exchange wallets underscores the platform’s robust demand, offering a compelling narrative amidst turbulent crypto seas. This scarcity of tokens available for sale on centralized exchanges is considered a bullish sign of Ethereum’s future performance.\n\nGrayscale floats Ethereum Futures ETF application\n\nIn a significant move, Grayscale recently filed an application for an Ethereum futures-based exchange-traded fund (ETF). This application follows a previous filing under the Securities Act of 1933, the same regulatory framework governing commodities and spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs.\n\nNotably, Grayscale‘s filing for an Ethereum futures ETF marks an important distinction, as the SEC has previously approved Bitcoin futures ETFs under both the Securities Act of 1933 and the Investment Company Act of 1940, which regulates most security-based ETFs. This move by Grayscale reflects the growing institutional interest in Ethereum.\n\nIn the midst of Ethereum’s journey, co-founder Vitalik Buterin’s voice resonates with a clear vision. Buterin places a strong emphasis on two pivotal pillars: privacy and decentralization. These principles, he asserts, are not mere aspirations but core priorities guiding Ethereum’s path forward.\n\nIn a crypto landscape marked by change, Buterin’s commitment to these ideals illuminates Ethereum’s enduring quest for a more private, decentralized, and inclusive digital future\n\nHe expressed concerns about the vulnerability of centralized entities like custodial exchanges, which can be easily corrupted. Buterin advocates for direct transactions on the Ethereum blockchain to empower users and enhance security.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum goes red as active addresses, deposits spike\n\nEthereum price analysis\n\nAfter facing resistance on July 14, Ethereum’s (ETH) price has been on a downward trend. Today, ETH is trading at $1,593, reflecting a 2.7% price decline in one week. Ethereum’s market capitalization stands above $191 billion, according to CoinGecko.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) of Ether on the weekly timeframe currently stands at 21.8, indicating a potential oversold condition. Ethereum has a critical support level of $1,500.\n\nWhile Ethereum’s recent price decline may worry investors, its fundamental developments and growing institutional interest suggest a promising future.\n\nFollow Us on Google News'}, {'id': 4, 'time': 'Fri, 20 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Did Lido fly too close to the sun? Inside the centralization debate - Blockworks', 'content': 'Lido, the largest liquid staking service provider on Ethereum, is approaching 33% market dominance. This state of affairs has raised concerns about centralization and the protocol being a threat to Ethereum’s security.\n\nAt the time of writing, Lido’s staking market share sits at 31.76%. This means that of all the staked ether on Ethereum, almost one-third of it is staked with Lido.\n\nDanny Ryan, an Ethereum Foundation researcher, noted in a 2022 blog post that if a liquid staking derivative (LSD) exceeds the 33% threshold, it has the theoretical capability to manipulate block space, potentially creating an economic monopoly.\n\nThis sentiment is shared by the Ethereum Foundation’s Mike Neuder, who identified in a blog post three possible attack vectors on the network: holders of Lido’s stETH product, node operators who run validators for the network, and Lido’s DAO.\n\nOf the three, Neuder said the DAO presents the greatest risk, writing that the “soft power” held by DAO members would allow them undue influence over the protocol.\n\nIn a series of interviews, Blockworks spoke with those who’ve raised the alarm that Lido’s dominance may be a pernicious force, as well as members of the Lido development team who argue that the threats to Ethereum’s economic security are overstated.\n\nRead more: Lido Finance drops Solana staking after DAO decision\n\nWhy Lido might present cause for concern\n\nLido DAO’s largest token holders include several funds. Paradigm holds 7% of the total supply of LDO, Lido’s governance token, making it the second-biggest whale, according to a dashboard from Arkham Intelligence. FalconX and Dragonfly Capital are also among the top holders of LDO.\n\nIan Unsworth, contributor to the liquid staking firm Stride, said the funds holding Lido (LDO) tokens are unlikely to liquidate their positions or maliciously attack the DAO. Still, investment funds have to return value to clients, and value creation could, someday, theoretically conflict with the principles of Ethereum.\n\n“At the end of the day, you should probably assume everyone is a profit maxi,” Unsworth said. “People aren’t going to [govern the DAO] because they like the ethos.”\n\nIf profit maximization means passing proposals meant to degrade Ethereum for personal gain, the DAO is not equipped to stop it, according to Nixo, the pseudonymous executive director of EthStaker.\n\nDAO members typically delegate votes to larger holders, meaning proposals can pass without much attention. This could lead to under-the-radar misdeeds, Nixo said.\n\n“It could be Apple knocking on the door and saying, ‘Hey, we would really like to push this [proposal] through in some sort of clandestine way,’” Nixo said, adding that nefarious DAO actors could also punish node operators who act against their wishes.\n\nNotably, the damage Lido’s ability to censor transactions or attack Ethereum grows at 50% and 66% of staked validator share, according to Ryan’s blog post. Nixo said hitting 33% dominance would signal to potential bad actors that higher thresholds are possible without excessive community pushback.\n\nEven if Lido’s DAO is composed of model Ethereans, growing dominance from the liquid staking provider threatens one of the network’s chief value propositions — its censorship resistance.\n\n“[Lido dominance] erodes the credible neutrality of Ethereum, which in turn devalues Ethereum itself,” Kevin Weaver, a backend engineer at Metropolis, said.\n\nLido’s response to centralization concerns\n\nKasper Rasmussen, a Lido Community Contributor, told Blockworks that Lido itself is an intermediary layer that facilitates interaction between Ethereum users and transparent, well-known Node Operators (NOs).\n\n“This process is underpinned by a network of 37 legitimate and autonomous NOs. These NOs are not only geographically dispersed, but each of them individually holds less than 1.5% of the total staked assets,” Rasmussen said.\n\nBroader community governance will be achieved through the development of dual governance, Rasmussen said. Dual governance means LDO holders are not the only ones with governing power — Lido staked ether (stETH) holders can apply veto to votes if they choose to.\n\nThis means it’s possible for stETH holders to engage in protocol governance without holding LDO tokens.\n\n“This ensures the protocol remains transparent, accountable and representative of the entire user base,” Rasmussen said.\n\nThe Lido team is also working to expand the Lido Protocol’s validator set. In September, it onboarded seven new node operators, Rasmussen noted.\n\n“This diversification serves as a protective measure against any single entity gaining control,” he said.\n\nLido as an ‘ideal’ villain for Ethereum?\n\nEnshrining liquid staking decentralization in the protocol’s code has generated buzz in Ethereum circles. Enshrinement could theoretically implement protocol updates that would make it impossible for liquid staking to become overly centralized.\n\nLido’s DAO also considered, and ultimately rejected, a...'}]

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
The news articles highlight legal disputes involving former ConsenSys employees and Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin over equity issues, as well as concerns about centralization in the Ethereum network due to the dominance of liquid staking service provider Lido. Despite these challenges, Ethereum's network fees have hit 2023 lows, with increasing on-chain activities indicating growing interest and utility in the network. Additionally, the announcement of Grayscale filing for an Ethereum futures-based ETF reflects growing institutional interest in Ethereum.

In reviewing my recent trading performance, it is evident that the effective strategies of prioritizing long-term gains, managing risk, and focusing on on-chain analysis have led to successful outcomes with positive daily returns. The emphasis on bullish trends, strong fundamentals, and growth potential of Ethereum in the long term has been key in making informed trading decisions. However, the mixed sentiment from news reports and short-term volatility have occasionally caused fluctuations in daily returns. Moving forward, it is crucial to continue prioritizing on-chain analysis, long-term strategies, and risk management while also considering the impact of news sentiment on market movements.

You are an experienced ETH cryptocurrency trader and you are trying to maximize your overall profit by trading ETH. In each day, you will make an action to buy or sell ETH. You are assisted by a few analysts below and need to decide the final action.

ON-CHAIN ANALYST REPORT:
"""
The ETH cryptocurrency has shown a consistent increase in open price over the past few days, reaching a peak of 1603.91. The total gas used has fluctuated slightly but remains high, indicating continued network activity. The number of unique addresses and total value transferred have also been steadily increasing. However, the average gas price has been on the rise, potentially impacting transaction costs. The MACD signal has recently turned to sell, suggesting a possible short-term bearish trend. Overall, the market trend for ETH appears to be bullish in the long term, but caution is advised in the short term due to the sell signal.
"""

NEWS ANALYST REPORT:
"""
The news articles highlight legal disputes involving former ConsenSys employees and Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin over equity issues, as well as concerns about centralization in the Ethereum network due to the dominance of liquid staking service provider Lido. Despite these challenges, Ethereum's network fees have hit 2023 lows, with increasing on-chain activities indicating growing interest and utility in the network. Additionally, the announcement of Grayscale filing for an Ethereum futures-based ETF reflects growing institutional interest in Ethereum. Overall, while legal disputes and centralization concerns may create short-term volatility, the increasing network activity and institutional interest suggest a positive long-term outlook for Ethereum's market performance.

*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the on-chain analyst report, we see that ETH has been experiencing a bullish trend in the long term, with increasing open prices, network activity, unique addresses, and total value transferred. However, caution is advised in the short term due to the recent sell signal from the MACD indicator. The news analyst report highlights legal disputes and centralization concerns but also mentions the positive aspects of decreasing network fees, growing on-chain activities, and institutional interest in Ethereum. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of prioritizing long-term gains, managing risk, and focusing on on-chain analysis for successful trading outcomes.

Synthesizing the reports, it is clear that while short-term volatility and challenges exist, the overall market trend for ETH remains positive in the long term. The increasing network activity, institutional interest, and growth potential of Ethereum suggest a favorable outlook for its market performance. Therefore, it is advisable to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains to maximize profit and mitigate risks effectively.

Considering the synthesized reports and the emphasis on long-term strategies, I would take a conservative trading approach and assign a trading action of 0.7, reflecting my confidence in the positive long-term trend of ETH while also acknowledging the potential short-term volatility. This decision aims to balance profit maximization with risk management in the current market conditions.

Amid this consolidation, the daily chart shows the forming of what appears to be a double-bottom pattern, a bullish reversal indicator.

This breakout has caused panic among investors, and if the outlook does not improve for ETH, more downside is likely. While the weekend price action has given bulls some hope, ETH needs to overcome two key resistance levels before investors can breath a sigh of relief.\n\nRead more: Ether crosses $1.6K, Bitcoin SV leads Altcoin gains with 30% bump\n\nEthereum price at crossroads\n\nEthereum (ETH) price set up four higher lows and three equal highs since May 2022. Connecting key swing points using trend lines reveals an ascending triangle pattern. This technical formation is bullish, and a decisive breakout forecasts an uptrend equal to the distance between the first swing high and swing low.\n\nBut for Ethereum price, the breakout was bearish, which forecasts a 45% crash to $998. This target is obtained by adding the distance between the first swing high and swing low to the breakout point at $1,825.\n\nIn its descent, Ethereum price has already breached the $1,639 support level, which has been key for the past year. If buyers fail to overcome this hurdle, it is likely ETH will continue its southbound move and eventually tag the $1,000 psychological level. From the current position of $1,598, this descent would constitute a 38% crash.\n\nAlso read: Solana vs. Ethereum: Renewed debate erupts over efficiency, development and scalability\n\nETH/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nOn the other hand, Ethereum price has produced three distinctive higher lows over the past month, which are not confirmed by the Relative Strength Index (RSI). This non-conformity is termed as bullish divergence and often leads to a small rally to the upside.\n\nDue to the aforementioned bullish signal, if Ethereum price manages to flip the $1,639 hurdle into a support floor on the daily or three-day time frame, it could provide bulls a respite. This move could likely attract more sidelined buyers and potentially trigger a minor rally to retest the next key resistance levels at $1,767 and $2,000.'}, {'id': 12, 'time': 'Sun, 22 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'One Ethereum Rival Is the Best ‘Non-Consensus’ Play for Next Bull Run, Says Crypto Investor Chris Burniske - The Daily Hodl', 'content': "A venture capitalist who called the bottom of the crypto bear market last year says that one of Ethereum’s (ETH) biggest rivals is the best contrarian altcoin play for the next bull run.\n\nCrypto investor Chris Burniske says that Solana (SOL) is the best “non-consensus” opportunity for an upcoming market expansion in the digital asset space.\n\nBurniske, the former head of crypto at Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest, says that SOL’s non-consensus status today is similar to ETH’s in the bear market of 2018.\n\n“ETH was non-consensus in 2018/2019, but is now consensus and anyone worth their salt as a crypto investor is there – quality asset.\n\nBut SOL is the strongest non-consensus asset of this bear. Watch out for when it becomes a consensus long, lots of momo investors will be scrambling.”\n\nLooking at Solana versus Ethereum (SOL/ETH), the investor says the pair looks like it may have enough steam to finally overcome the level that it lost during the collapse of the now-defunct crypto exchange FTX. FTX had close ties to Solana and its collapse brought uncertainty to the Ethereum competitor’s ecosystem.\n\n“SOL/ETH putting in some work to make 0.02 [ETH] happen, would close the FTX gap.”\n\nAt time of writing, SOL is trading for $29.51, up over 9% in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe crypto investor also says that other venture capitalists (VCs) are distracted with artificial intelligence (AI) and are missing out on the potential gains that could be had by picking up the discounts currently in the digital asset space.\n\n“VCs that are smug about crypto getting trashed, while AI has become the hot new thing, don’t realize the majority of overpriced AI rounds will be a graveyard for capital as the data incumbents mop the floor, while the low valuations we see in Web3 today will mint legends tomorrow.”\n\nDon't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The news articles suggest a mixed outlook for Ethereum (ETH) in the cryptocurrency market. While there are concerns about a potential 45% crash for ETH due to a bearish breakout and failure to reclaim key resistance levels, there is also optimism surrounding the potential for a minor rally if ETH can overcome the $1,639 hurdle. Additionally, the mention of Solana (SOL) as a strong non-consensus altcoin play and the overall surge in cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Dogecoin, indicate a positive sentiment in the market.

REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, we see that ETH has been experiencing a bullish trend in the long term, with increasing open prices, network activity, unique addresses, and total value transferred.

The news analyst report highlights legal disputes and centralization concerns but also mentions the positive aspects of decreasing network fees, growing on-chain activities, and institutional interest in Ethereum. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of prioritizing long-term gains, managing risk, and focusing on on-chain analysis for successful trading outcomes.

Synthesizing the reports, it is clear that while short-term volatility and challenges exist, the overall market trend for ETH remains positive in the long term.

The news analyst report highlights the struggle of ETH to break above the $1,600 resistance level, but also mentions positive developments such as the upcoming Deneb-Cancun upgrade and the potential for a more stable market with Ethereum Code AI.

Reflecting on my trading performance, it is clear that prioritizing long-term strategies and on-chain analysis has been effective in maximizing profit and managing risks. Short-term volatility and mixed sentiment have occasionally led to minor losses, emphasizing the importance of a moderately conservative trading approach.

Considering the synthesized reports, the overall market trend for ETH appears uncertain in the short term, with potential for a downward correction.

Coins like Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Ethereum are often implicated as funding streams for Islamist organizations.\n\nThe use of digital currencies and crypto exchange platforms to finance Islamist extremism has come under increasing scrutiny after the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas, France 24 reported.\n\nOn Oct. 19, the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) proposed new regulations to classify “Convertible Virtual Currency Mixing” (CVC mixing) as a primary money laundering concern to combat its use by malicious actors, including Hamas.\n\n“Mixers” or “tumblers” blend cryptocurrency of illicit origin with other funds, increasing the risk of using crypto mixers for money laundering or concealing earnings, according to the crypto industry news site Cointelegraph.\n\nSee Also: Crypto Analyst Foresees Bitcoin Breaking $70,000 Barrier Soon, But Only If This Happens\n\nPost the Oct. 7 attack, the Israeli defense ministry claimed to have seized virtual wallets linked to Hamas that received $41 million between 2019 and 2023. The Palestinian Islamic Jihad group reportedly raised $94 million in cryptocurrency over recent years, as per British firm Elliptic.\n\nOn Oct. 18, Washington sanctioned “Buy Cash,” a Gaza-based company, for allegedly facilitating cryptocurrency transfers to Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad.\n\nDespite these revelations, experts like Tom Keatinge, director of the Centre for Financial Crime Research and Security Studies at the Royal United Service Institute, caution against overhyping cryptocurrency’s role in funding extremism. Most of Hamas’ budget, estimated at nearly $1 billion, comes from “expatriates or private donors in the Gulf region,” as per Deutsche Welle.\n\nIn this respect, the $41 million in cryptocurrencies seized by the Israeli authorities may seem like a drop in the bucket for Hamas, as per the report.\n\nNevertheless, crypto has become a more prominent funding method due to its ease and speed of transactions. The rising crackdown on traditional terrorist financing channels has led these groups to explore new ways of raising money, such as cryptocurrencies.\n\nCryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE), and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) are increasingly accused of facilitating funding for Islamist groups. Hamas’ use of crypto was first revealed in January 2019. Initially, these “funding 2.0” initiatives raised only a few thousand dollars. However, Hamas has increasingly used social media networks as funding channels ever since.\n\nRead Next: Bitcoin Core Dev Warns Of “All Your Mempool Are Belong To Us” Attack, Steps Down From Lightning Network\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nEngineered by Benzinga Neuro, Edited by Pooja Rajkumari\n\nThe GPT-4-based Benzinga Neuro content generation system exploits the extensive Benzinga Ecosystem, including native data, APIs, and more to create comprehensive and timely stories for you.

An examination of its daily chart indicates a pivotal juncture at which Ethereum currently finds itself.\n\nFirst and foremost, a glance at the chart reveals a potential resistance level that Ethereum seems to struggle with. This is evident from the multiple touchpoints that gravitate toward this price ceiling. Historically, consistent inability to break through such resistance has often led to sharp retraces. For Ethereum, the implications could be more pronounced, given the other market dynamics currently in play.\n\nOne concerning trend is Ethereum\'s low network activity. Despite being a hub for countless decentralized apps, the recent lull in on-chain operations signals waning interest or, perhaps, a temporary shift of focus toward newer blockchain platforms. A thriving network is not just about transactions — it is also about development, upgrades and new projects. Low network activity might hint at a pause in these endeavors.\n\nMoreover, while Ethereum wrestles with its price, competitors like Solana are making substantial gains. With a 34% price increase since its local low, Solana is outpacing Ethereum in the race. This divergence is noteworthy. Ethereum\'s hegemony in the decentralized space is being tested, and these performance metrics might force investors to reconsider their portfolios.\n\nSolana takes stage\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is no stranger to spectacular price movements, and Solana (SOL) has recently been at the center of attention. Experiencing an astounding 34% price surge, SOL is definitely not staying on the sidelines. But with such rapid appreciation, investors and traders are inevitably asking: When might this bullish rally slow down or reverse?\n\nSolana\'s recent price action can be attributed to a variety of factors. Labeled as going through its "second youth," the digital asset is enjoying tremendous growth in network activity. This vitality and resurgence can be seen as a testament to the resilience and potential of the Solana blockchain.\n\nOne key element backing this sentiment is Solana\'s survival through the FTX crisis. Such events can be a death knell for many other cryptos, but not Solana. Its ability to bounce back and even thrive post-crisis underscores its robustness, making it a formidable player in the crypto arena.\n\nA glance at the Solana price chart indicates a powerful uptrend, characterized by higher highs and higher lows. The recent bullish candles reflect the strong buying interest and momentum. However, as with all significant price surges, there is always the possibility of a pullback or correction.\n\nThe chart showcases a potential resistance point, where traders might take profits, leading to a temporary slowdown in the price ascent. Moreover, while the relative strength index (RSI) is not in the overbought territory yet, continued upward movement could push it into that zone, indicating that a potential price correction might be on the horizon.\n\nCardano remains neutral\n\nRecently, Cardano (ADA) has shown promising signs, primarily by its ability to maintain its position above a crucial technical marker — the 50 exponential moving average (EMA). This development cannot be understated, as it often signifies a crucial pivot in sentiment and price direction.\n\nThe 50 EMA serves as a dynamic support or resistance level, depending on where the price stands in relation to it. In Cardano\'s case, remaining above the 50 EMA can be interpreted as a bullish sign, indicating that recent price averages are higher than the longer-term averages.\n\nTraders and analysts often regard this positioning as an affirmation of an asset\'s resilience and potential for upward momentum. In layman\'s terms, it is a line in the sand, one that ADA is currently on the favorable side of.\n\nAn observable aspect in the current ADA price chart is the downtrend\'s gradual flattening. After periods of pronounced decline, this leveling out can often precede a trend reversal. Essentially, it can be seen as the market taking a breather, consolidating and potentially gearing up for the next move.'}, {'id': 6, 'time': 'Mon, 23 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Bitcoin Could Get Ethereum-Style Smart Contracts Under 'BitVM' Plan - CoinDesk", 'content': "The protocol is presented by Garand Fill today with Algo Kit. Welcome back to first mover. Our next guest is out with a recent white paper that outlines a new paradigm to bring Ethereum style smart contracts to the Bitcoin network. Joining us now is zero sync co-founder Robin Linus Robin. Welcome to the show. Hi, thanks for having me. All right. Talk to us about this white paper in it. You know that bit VM is a computing paradigm to express turn complete Bitcoin contracts. Explain to us what's going on here and what the real world problem is that we're solving. Well, the very high level rework problem that we are solving is Bitcoin scalability. Um Yeah, we would love to scale Bitcoin to millions of transactions per second. And currently that's not possible on the main layer unfortunately. And yeah, if we had more expressive smart contracting capabilities on Bitcoin, um we could bridge Bitcoin to like side chain systems or other feature-rich systems such that we can uh essentially scale BT C transactions more or less indefinitely. Uh So this is not the first proposal for smart contracts on Bitcoin correct on the Bitcoin network. So what makes this different than any, anything else that's out there right now. Mm So the scripting capabilities of Bitcoin, they are quite limited. Um It's not a very feature-rich platform in comparison to let's say Ethereum or other smart contracting platforms that we know. And um yeah, actually Bitcoin script is intentionally limited to reduce the attack surface of Bitcoin. And um what BIT BM does, it's uh it's kind of like hacking around these limitations. It's like uh a compilation of a couple tricks that allow you to uh overcome the limitations of Bitcoin script. And yeah, to express more uh expressive smart contracts on Bitcoin. OK. But in terms of what, what's out there right now, what's the difference? Um Yeah, you can express more stuff than you, you were used to like um in Bitcoin script, you can mostly express stuff like multi signatures, maybe also hash logs and um the basic stuff that enables also lightning and stuff like that. But um you cannot, for example, bridge Bitcoin to a side chain that is not possible today. Um But BIT VM might enable that. And, and how do you see it differing from what's available on the Ethereum chain right now? When, when, when you, if this were to to be launched, uh what, what kind of structure makes it either comparable, better or worse if you will uh than what's, what's on Ethereum. Um Yeah, Ethereum is designed to facilitate this smart contracts and Bitcoin is not um what we are doing here is um we are, we are, we are applying tricks to mimic what Ethereum is doing. So, uh in the end, it will not be quite as expressive as Ethereum is. Um however, these bridges uh they can enable or like they, they can allow you to bridge Bitcoin to a side chain and that side chain could run essentially the same code as assume and then you could have essentially um yeah, BT C in uh the EBM in, in, in the same smart contracting machine as on a theory, what would be the need for doing it on Bitcoin and not on Ethereum? Yeah. Well, Bitcoin is a hard asset. Bitcoin is hard to change and Bitcoin is by far the number one asset in the world, it's the strongest brand and it's uh the currency that we all love, I think. And that's why we should do it with B BT C and with it, what are some of the potential applications you see here that would be better run in the Bitcoin ecosystem than the Ethereum? One of course, um you mentioned a bunch of problems that you're trying to solve that exist in the Ethereum network. Of course, layer twos have solved, solved some of the issues that you're trying to solve. What are some of the potential applications that might attract developers and users to Bitcoin versus Ethereum? Yeah, I'm personally mostly interested into scalability um uh I wanna see Bitcoin scaling to, as I said, a million transactions per second. And um yeah, I think that would be great to uh see Bitcoin being used as a currency for, yeah, daily, daily life payments and uh for basically any kinds of payments. And uh it would be great if we could um process that many transactions. And are there any limitations here with uh bit VM that you anticipate? Oh yeah, it's, as I said, it's like that's uh it's piling tricks on top of each other to mimic what Ethereum is doing. And um one thing that is very different than the EVM is that um in, in BVM, you always need a verifier. Um So there is like some party doing this, this pack doing this bridge and then there is um there could be like hundreds of very fires and um all of them, they are uh surveilling uh the uh the person that is facilitating the bridge and they are verifying that um they stay honest and if they don't stay honest, then the verifier can punish um the bridge. So this is a white paper. How, how long do you think it would take to get it uh on the ground? Um Yeah, we are developing um the first version of it...."}, {'id': 1, 'time': 'Mon, 23 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum Price Prediction as $3 Billion Trading Volume Sends ETH Past $1600 – Time to Buy? - Cryptonews', 'content': 'Ethereum Price Prediction as $3 Billion Trading Volume Sends ETH Past $1,600 – Time to Buy?\n\nAmidst turbulent market conditions, Ethereum has garnered attention as its trading volume surpassed $2.6 billion, propelling its price beyond the $1,600 mark.

ETH is rising, but it might struggle to clear the $1,850 resistance.\n\nEthereum started a steady increase above the $1,750 resistance.\n\nThe price is trading above $1,780 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $1,750 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could struggle to clear the $1,850 and $1,880 resistance levels.\n\nEthereum Price Jumps 10%\n\nEthereum remained in a positive zone above the $1,650 support zone. The recent pump in Bitcoin above the $34,000 resistance sparked more upsides in ETH. There was a steady increase above the $1,720 and $1,750 resistance levels.\n\nThe price even cleared the key $1,800 resistance zone. A high is formed near $1,849 and the price is now consolidating gains. It is trading well above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,660 swing low to the $1,849 high.\n\nEthereum is now trading above $1,780 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $1,750 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The trend line is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,660 swing low to the $1,849 high.\n\nOn the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $1,850 level. The first major resistance is near the $1,880 zone. A close above the $1,880 resistance could send the price further higher. The next key resistance is $1,920, above which the price could accelerate higher.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nIn the stated case, Ether could start a strong increase toward the $2,000 resistance. Any more gains might open the doors for a move toward $2,200.\n\nDownside Correction in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,850 resistance, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,800 level.\n\nThe next key support is $1,750 and the trend line zone. A downside break below the $1,750 support might send the price further lower. In the stated case, the price could drop toward the $1,700 level. Any more losses may perhaps send Ether toward the $1,650 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level – $1,750\n\nMajor Resistance Level – $1,850\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

This slight edge over its previous peak in April underscores the market’s bullish momentum.\n\nBitcoin, leading the charge, has set a fresh yearly record, outpacing its previous best by 11%. Altcoins, too, have been on a tear, with some, like MINA, registering eye-popping gains of up to 120%.\n\nIn contrast, Ethereum‘s performance, while commendable, hasn’t quite matched the fervor seen in other coins. Since October 11, it has appreciated by 21%, a respectable figure but somewhat muted compared to the broader market’s exuberance. Currently trading around $1,800, it remains 15% shy of its yearly peak of $2,100.\n\nETH Price Analysis\n\nEthereum’s trajectory since its June 18 low last year has been relatively more optimistic than many of its peers. It embarked on a recovery journey, marking a higher low in November and subsequently achieving a higher peak in April compared to its August high.\n\nPost its $2,100 zenith, Ethereum managed to maintain its value above the $1,500 threshold, charting its course within a descending channel. This resilience stands in stark contrast to several altcoins that plummeted to new bearish lows post-April.\n\nThis descending trajectory Ethereum found itself in likely represented a corrective phase, characterized by a five-wave pattern. However, the tide seems to be turning. Starting from October 11, Ethereum has been exhibiting bullish signals, culminating in a breakout from this channel.\n\nThe rise of Ethereum from November 21 to mid-April presents an analytical conundrum. The movement, characterized by a five-wave impulse, is somewhat ambiguous in its interpretation due to the higher low on November 21.\n\nThis could mean that the surge is merely an extension of the previous ascending structure, rendering it a corrective phase rather than a new bullish cycle.\n\nHowever, there’s an alternative, more optimistic perspective. If we consider this rise as a smaller segment within a broader framework, it could be interpreted as just the initial sub-wave of a more extensive five-wave impulse.\n\nUnder this assumption, the descending channel that followed would represent the second wave of this larger cycle. If this interpretation holds, Ethereum could be poised for a significant upward trajectory. Wave 3, in this context, could propel the price to around $3,310. And if the momentum sustains, wave 5 could push the price even further, breaking previous boundaries.\n\nGiven the undeniable corrective nature of the descending channel, the odds currently favor a continuation of the upward trend for Ethereum. But does this imply an imminent new yearly high?\n\nThe current high, just a touch above $2,000, remains shy of the July 14 peak. By the tenets of technical analysis, this positions Ethereum in a downtrend since mid-April.\n\nHowever, a breach above the $2,000 mark, resulting in a higher high, would disrupt this bearish narrative. Such a move would not only signify a reversal of the downtrend but also set the stage for a potential new yearly high. Conversely, if the current surge falters and pivots into a decline, Ethereum might be subjected to further losses before it can embark on a genuine bull run.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPlease note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.

A testament to its struggles is the drastic dip in ETH’s total value locked (TVL) — plummeting from a whopping $108 billion in November 2021 to a mere $20 billion by October, marking an almost 82% drop.\n\nLet’s delve into the dynamics surrounding Ethereum and try to understand the current market sentiments, key metrics, and insights into what lies ahead for this crypto.\n\nDeclining NFT market\n\nIn Jan. 2023, Ethereum’s NFT space witnessed significant headwinds. The bustling activity that saw more than 28,000 NFTs being minted daily on Ethereum at the beginning of the year took a sharp downturn.\n\nETH NFT mints | Source: The Block\n\nAs of Oct. 20, that enthusiasm has waned, with daily mintings dropping below 3,500. This significant 88% decline can be attributed to increased competition from other blockchain networks, a possible oversupply, and the general volatility of the crypto market.\n\nTrading hasn’t been spared either. Platforms like OpenSea, once brimming with sales, observed a slowdown, particularly after the first quarter, hitting their lowest ebb by Sep. Moreover, from Q1 to Q2 2023, Ethereum’s NFT trading volume shrank by 39.6%, according to CoinGecko.\n\nParallel to the ebb in NFT momentum, 2023 also marked the entry of Ethscriptions. Launched in June, this platform aimed to transform the NFT space by allowing users to inscribe “non-financial data” on Ethereum’s network.\n\nHowever, its journey was riddled with hurdles. A major setback occurred when a prominent collection named Ethereum Punks had to be withdrawn from Ethscriptions’ official platform.\n\nAt the request of Yuga Labs, the owner of CryptoPunks, I am taking down the Ethereum Punks website, removing all Ethereum Punks images from https://t.co/ZcR9HKlexS, and deleting my Tweets that reference Ethereum Punks, including my Tweet introducing the Ethscriptions Protocol. — Middlemarch (@dumbnamenumbers) July 11, 2023\n\nThis action was taken upon a request from Yuga Labs, the entity behind CryptoPunks. The ripple effect of this removal was evident as it led to the deletion of numerous tweets by the creator of Ethscriptions, Middlemarch, including the pivotal one introducing the Ethscriptions Protocol.\n\nThese challenges faced by Ethereum’s NFT and Ethscriptions hint at broader concerns within the Ethereum ecosystem, shedding light on competitive, regulatory, and inherent protocol-based challenges.\n\nWhat do the metrics suggest?\n\nSeveral critical metrics can gauge Ethereum’s health and vibrancy. Let’s delve into these to unravel their story about Ethereum in 2023.\n\nETH daily transactions\n\nThese represent the number of transactions processed on the Ethereum blockchain within a day. In May 2023, this number averaged around 1.14 million, but by Oct. 20, it had diminished to 980,000, marking a 14% decline.\n\nEthereum daily transactions | Source: The Block\n\nWhy does this matter? A high transaction count typically indicates robust network usage and utility, making it a bellwether of network health.\n\nYou might also like: Vitalik Buterin discusses Ethereum’s future and innovative projects in AMA\n\nThe reduction hints at a reduced activity level, possibly due to competition from other blockchains or waning enthusiasm from users and developers.\n\nDaily active addresses\n\nThis metric denotes the number of unique addresses that actively send or receive Ethereum on a given day. In April 2023, the daily active addresses averaged 471,000, but this number dwindled to 369,000 by Oct. 20, showcasing a 21.7% drop.\n\nEthereum active addresses | Source: The Block\n\nIts significance lies in its ability to act as a pulse check for user engagement and network popularity. A declining trend in active addresses might imply that fewer users or entities are interacting with the Ethereum network, possibly signaling a shift of interest or a consolidation phase.\n\nDaily onchain volume\n\nRepresenting the total value (in USD) of all transactions on the Ethereum blockchain in a day, the daily onchain volume has witnessed a steady decline. From a substantial $3.92 billion in March, it shrank to $1.41 billion by Oct. 20, reflecting a 64% reduction.\n\nEthereum daily on-chain volume | Source: The Block\n\nThis metric is crucial because it sheds light on the monetary value of assets moving within the network. A decline might suggest that fewer high-value transactions are taking place or that the value of assets on Ethereum has decreased.\n\nETH transaction fee\n\nTran...'}]

The overall sentiment in the market seems uncertain, with potential for both downside and upside movements depending on market dynamics.

In reflection of the recent trading performance, it is evident that prioritizing long-term strategies and on-chain analysis has been effective in maximizing profit and managing risks. The emphasis on the bullish trend of ETH in the long term has led to successful outcomes, while a cautious approach in the face of short-term volatility has helped mitigate potential losses.

Considering the mixed sentiment and potential for short-term volatility in the market, a moderately conservative trading approach is warranted to balance profit maximization with risk management effectively. Therefore, it is advisable to focus on long-term strategies rather than short-term gains.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is showing signs of turning bearish. The fluctuations in key metrics such as unique addresses, total value transferred, and average gas price, along with the shift in MACD signal from buy to sell, indicate a potential reversal in market trend towards a bearish direction. 

On the other hand, the news analyst report presents a mixed outlook for ETH, with concerns about a potential crash but also optimism surrounding a minor rally if key resistance levels are overcome. The overall sentiment in the market seems uncertain, with potential for both downside and upside movements depending on market dynamics.

In reflection of the recent trading performance, it is evident that prioritizing long-term strategies and on-chain analysis has been effective in maximizing profit and managing risks. The emphasis on the bullish trend of ETH in the long term has led to successful outcomes, while a cautious approach in the face of short-term volatility has helped mitigate potential losses.

Considering the mixed sentiment and potential for short-term volatility in the market, a moderately conservative trading approach is warranted to balance profit maximization with risk management effectively. Therefore, it is advisable to focus on long-term strategies rather than short-term gains.

Based on the synthesized reports and the emphasis on long-term strategies, I would take a slightly bearish stance on the market trend with a trading action of -0.3, reflecting a moderate level of confidence in the bearish direction and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.
ACTION:
-0.3
DAILY RETURN:
0.028918056489492416
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing fluctuations with a potential shift towards a bearish sentiment. The increase in gas usage and average gas prices, along with the MACD signal shifting to a sell, indicate a possible reversal in the market trend. On the other hand, the news analyst report presents a more optimistic outlook, highlighting positive developments such as the increase in trading volume for Ethereum and the potential for an upward shift in price.

In reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a long-term strategy based on on-chain analysis is crucial in maximizing profit and managing risks effectively. While short-term volatility may present challenges, focusing on long-term trends and key indicators such as unique addresses, total value transferred, and MACD signals can help inform trading decisions.

Considering the mixed sentiment in the market and the importance of long-term strategies, it is advisable to take a moderately conservative approach to trading. This involves balancing profit maximization with risk management by carefully monitoring market trends and making informed decisions.

Therefore, based on the synthesized reports and the emphasis on long-term strategies, I would take a slightly conservative approach and assign a trading action of 0.3. This reflects a moderate level of confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.
ACTION:

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market has been experiencing fluctuations with bearish signals such as the MACD indicating a sell trend. On the other hand, the news analyst report presents a more positive outlook for Ethereum, suggesting bullish momentum and the potential for ETH to reach new highs.

In light of these conflicting reports, it is essential to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains. The reflection analyst report highlights the effectiveness of focusing on key indicators and long-term trends to maximize profit and manage risks successfully. It also emphasizes the importance of a moderately conservative trading approach to balance profit maximization with risk management in uncertain market conditions.

Considering the mixed sentiment in the market and the potential for short-term volatility, it is prudent to adopt a cautious and strategic approach. Therefore, I would recommend a conservative trading action with a confidence level of 0.3, indicating a slight inclination towards selling ETH to manage risks effectively and align with the bearish signals from the on-chain analysis.

*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the ETH market is currently experiencing a bearish trend with potential for further decline. The sell signals in the MACD analysis and fluctuating market indicators suggest a lack of bullish momentum in the short term. 

Contrastingly, the news analyst report paints a more optimistic picture for ETH, highlighting a surge in buying activity and positive market sentiment driven by potential developments such as the approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF and new projects on the Ethereum ecosystem. The bullish outlook in the short to medium term is supported by the presence of supply pressure near $1,800 and the majority of ETH holders being in a profitable position.

In reflecting on the reports, it is clear that a long-term trading strategy based on on-chain analysis and key indicators has been effective in maximizing profit and managing risks successfully. While short-term gains may be possible, a moderately conservative approach is recommended to navigate the current market volatility and uncertainty.

Considering the mixed sentiment in the market and the importance of long-term strategies, I would take a slightly conservative approach and assign a trading action of 0.3. This reflects my confidence in the bullish trend in the short to medium term, while also acknowledging the potential for short-term pullbacks and the need to manage risk effectively.

But market participants shouldn’t take their eyes off ethereum.\n\nEthereum is the digital platform for transactions conducted in ether, the second-largest digital currency behind bitcoin. Alone, that status makes ethereum worth watching, if not investing in. Regarding the latter point, a slew of recently launched U.S.-listed ETFs make that process easier. That group includes the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT).\n\nThe actively listed EFUT "offers exposure to ether-linked investments through an accessible exchange traded vehicle. The Fund does not invest in ether or other digital assets directly,” according to VanEck. Some interesting signs are pointing to near-term upside for ethereum, potentially signaling that EFUT is a new ETF for risk-tolerant investors to consider.\n\nEthereum Whale Watching\n\nA favorite pastime of some experienced crypto investors is monitoring “whale” activity in some of the more broadly tracked, liquid digital currencies; namely, bitcoin and ether. In simple terms, whales are sizable owners of these cryptocurrenices, and their buy and sell orders can affect pricing.\n\nEFUT could receive a spark from ether whales because data indicates that cohort of market participants has recently been active.\n\n“Indeed, Ethereum whale transactions, specifically those above $100,000, have skyrocketed to a six-month high, while the supply of ETH on exchanges has hit a record low since its genesis in 2015, according to the data shared by blockchain analytics platform Santiment on October 25,” reported Ana Zirojevic for Finbold.\n\nIncreased activity among large traders could very well be one reason ether is higher by more than 14% over the past week. As Finbold noted, there were nearly 6,050 ethereum trades worth at least $100,000 on Tuesday, representing the biggest day by that metric in six months.\n\nStory continues\n\nPotentially adding to the case for EFUT is that point that the recent uptick in sizable activity in ethereum isn’t a one-off contained to this digital currency. Rather, it’s occurring across other major cryptocurrencies as well.\n\n“At the same time, Bitcoin (BTC), Cardano (ADA), and Dai (DAI) are witnessing massive increases in whale activity themselves, with Bitcoin recording 14,833 of $100,000+ transactions on October 24, the most since June’s news of the multiple filings for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), according to the blockchain platform’s analysis,” observed Finbold.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Beyond Basic Beta Channel.\n\nPOPULAR ARTICLES AND RESOURCES FROM ETFTRENDS.COM\n\n\n\nREAD MORE AT ETFTRENDS.COM >'}, {'id': 3, 'time': 'Thu, 26 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum Faces Critical Test At $1,960 As Massive 33 Million ETH Resistance Emerges - ZyCrypto', 'content': 'Advertisement\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has been making significant strides in recent weeks, riding on the wave of positive developments in the crypto industry.\n\nOver the past seven days, Ether has witnessed a remarkable surge of 16%. However, its primary rival, Bitcoin, has outpaced it with a 20% surge during the same period. Notably, this surge saw Ethereum breaking key resistance at $1,745, sparking optimism among investors and analysts.\n\nDespite these gains, Ethereum’s upward momentum is now at a critical juncture. The crypto community is closely monitoring a formidable resistance level at $1,960, which has raised concerns.\n\nOn Thursday, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez took to Twitter to shed light on this impending challenge, stating, “When will Ethereum break out? Well, you may need to wait for $ETH to overcome the huge supply wall at $1,960. Here, 1.14 million addresses bought nearly 33 million ETH, according to data from Into the Block.”\n\nThis said resistance level, often referred to as a “buy wall,” represents a level where a substantial amount of Ethereum was bought in the past. Investors who bought then may be inclined to sell their Ethereum at this price point, which can act as a significant barrier to further price appreciation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, the close correlation between Ethereum and Bitcoin has been evident, where changes in one frequently impact the other. In another tweet, Martinez pointed out that Bitcoin’s potential 5% correction to $33,000, driven by its formation of an ascending triangle on the hourly chart, a move that could trigger a similar selloff in Ethereum.\n\nAdding to Martinez’s views, crypto analyst ‘Cryptotony’ also presented a bearish perspective on Ethereum, telling his 346,000 X followers that the cryptocurrency might gain momentum and test the $2,500 resistance zone before entering a distribution phase and possibly decline leading up to the next halving event.\n\nAnother analyst, ‘Cryptonary,’ emphasized the significance of Ethereum’s ongoing test, stating that it was crucial to determine whether the bulls could break through the resistance at $1,960 or if Ethereum would echo Bitcoin’s overbought signals.\n\nNotably, the pundit’s technical analysis revealed that Ethereum had been oscillating between support at $1,745 and resistance at $1,823-$1,853, with no clear breakout yet. Additionally, he noted that the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) was overbought but not as extended as Bitcoin’s.\n\nThat said, as Ethereum faces a pivotal moment along the $1,960 resistance level, the outcome of this test will determine whether Ethereum can continue its recent bullish trend, plunge or face a period of consolidation.\n\nEther was trading at $1,796 at press time after a 0.32% increase over the past 24 hours.'}, {'id': 6, 'time': 'Thu, 26 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Core devs rule out Dencun fork this year - Blockworks', 'content': 'Ethereum client developers confirmed on Thursday that the anticipated Dencun upgrade will not be implemented in a network hard fork before the end of 2023.\n\nAlready last month, when the new Holešky testnet was successfully launched behind schedule, the consensus was that putting the upgrade through its paces by the time December holidays rolled around was unlikely.\n\nWhen an optimistic scenario was put forward on today’s All Core Developers call, the consensus was evidently with pseudonymous Prysm developer Potuz, who commented, “there is no way we are forking mainnet in 2023.”\n\nHe pointed to consistent consensus issues arising on the 10 developer networks (devnets) that have been spun up so far to test the upgrade over the past few months, adding that “not a single one went well.”\n\nRead more: Devnet, testnet, mainnet: Ethereum’s next upgrade progresses — slowly\n\nEthereum clients are divided into two main camps, one for the execution layer and the other the consensus layer, with the distinction reflected in the name of the upgrade — consensus teams use cities where Ethereum’s major conference, Devcon, has been held (e.g. Cancun), while execution client developers opt for star names (e.g. Deneb) — hence “Dencun.”\n\nIn contrast to the consensus teams, execution layer client teams reported being in good shape for the upcoming testnets.\n\n“We are in a pretty good place, a lot of things are also on Master now,” said Geth developer known as Lightclient, referring to the Go Ethereum project’s digital workspace where the code, files, and revision history are stored.\n\nDevnet 10 was launched this week, with plans for the execution clients to transition to a larger test on the Goerli testnet. But Prysm’s Potuz is not on board with that idea.\n\n“I’m definitely not comfortable at all having a full client fork on Goerli,” he said. “I see very large and deep changes still being pushed in the branch,” he added regarding Prysm, the software currently runs 45% of the consensus layer clients.\n\nA smaller Devnet 11 is planned, but it now appears the move to testnets will be put off until after Ethereum’s Devconnect developer conference, which will be held in Istanbul in mid-November.\n\nCelebrating the KZG ceremony\n\nThe Dencun upgrade required a bit of fancy cryptography to ensure the Ethereum scaling improvement, known as Proto-Danksharding, a key feature, remains secure.\n\nThe KZG Ceremony involved multiple participants, each concocting a secret and performing a computation to blend it with preceding contributions. This process results in the formation of a “structured reference string” (SRS), which is crucial for the KZG Commitments cryptographic scheme, and integral to Proto-Danksharding.\n\nThe final outcome of this chain of contributions is then put into the upgrade. The whole setup remains secure so long as there is at least one honest participant in the ceremony. After months of soliciting contributions, a total of 141,416 makes that all but certain.\n\nCarl Beekhuizen, who coordinated the ceremony for the Ethereum Foundation, invited participants to verify that their contributions are, in fact, included, by visiting ceremony.ethereum.org.\n\nThere, one can input a contributing wallet address, and receive a commemorative POAP NFT.\n\nDon’t miss the next big story – join our free daily newsletter.'}]

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing fluctuations with a potential shift towards a bearish sentiment. The increase in gas usage and average gas prices, along with the MACD signal shifting to a sell, indicate a possible reversal in the market trend. On the other hand, the news analyst report presents a more optimistic outlook, highlighting positive developments such as the increase in trading volume for Ethereum and the potential for an upward shift in price.

In reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a long-term strategy based on on-chain analysis is crucial in maximizing profit and managing risks effectively. While short-term volatility may present challenges, focusing on long-term trends and key indicators such as unique addresses, total value transferred, and MACD signals can help inform trading decisions.

Considering the mixed sentiment in the market and the importance of long-term strategies, it is advisable to take a moderately conservative approach to trading. This involves balancing profit maximization with risk management by carefully monitoring market trends and making informed decisions.

Therefore, based on the synthesized reports and the emphasis on long-term strategies, I would take a slightly conservative approach and assign a trading action of 0.3. This reflects a moderate level of confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.

As of 12:45 p.m. ET on Friday, these three top-10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization rose 14.7%, 10.4% and 15.4%, respectively, over the past seven days.\n\nIt shouldn\'t be surprising for many investors to see Bitcoin lead the market higher, as that\'s par for the course for this space. With roughly half the market cap of the entire crypto sector, the direction Bitcoin moves on a given week typically determines how other digital assets perform.\n\nAccordingly, one might view this week\'s news that a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) could be hitting the market sooner than thought as the rising tide that\'s lifting all boats. I certainly think there\'s something to that.\n\nWith that said, let\'s dive into what specifically drove these three cryptos higher over the past week and where they may be headed from here.\n\nBitcoin ETF launch dominates the crypto news cycle\n\nIt\'s been a busy week in the world of crypto, with the Sam Bankman-Fried trial ongoing, various macro-data releases impacting monetary policy decisions released, and a flurry of token-specific news that\'s been enough to make the heads of many investors in the market spin. Of course, this week\'s Bitcoin news has dominated the headlines, and for good reason.\n\nEssentially, a number of hints that Blackrock\'s spot Bitcoin ETF will finally be pushed over the goal line have materialized this week, with this ETF reportedly being listed on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation database under the ticker IBTC.\n\nThis ticker appears to have been taken down and put back up again, but the fact that we\'re seeing this ticker listed is apparently enough of a catalyst for crypto bulls to point to. Many believe this could be the moment Bitcoin is officially viewed as \'open for investment\' for institutional investors, much in the same way gold ETFs made investing in precious metals much simpler and more attractive for money managers.\n\nOn that note, I\'ve been reading a number of interesting analyses on this topic, with many experts attempting to quantify what a spot Bitcoin ETF could mean for the digital currency in terms of capital inflows into Bitcoin and the broader sector as a whole. Right now, I think most of these reports require a great deal of guesswork, so I\'m not sure how much credence to give these. However, I do think it\'s true that Bitcoin and Ethereum (assuming a spot Ethereum ETF is next, which would be 100% logical) will receive a big boost from a rush of capital into these alternative assets.\n\nOther, more speculative altcoins, such as Dogecoin, may be well positioned to ride a wave of momentum higher. Dogecoin\'s price action typically takes its cue from the directional forces created by Bitcoin and Ethereum in a given week.\n\nIndeed, the fact that Dogecoin has moved even higher than Bitcoin and Ethereum on broadly bullish market sentiment outlines the value this token provides traders as a higher-beta option in this space. A number of experts continue to point to "irrational exuberance" when discussing Dogecoin\'s price action over the past few days as the key driver of this token. I tend to agree.\n\nWhere are these three tokens headed from here?\n\nIt\'s clear that there\'s robust reason for Bitcoin and Ethereum to be up this week. As for the rest of the market, animal spirits appear to remain high, which is a great thing for crypto speculators banking on yet another catalyst-driven bull run over the near term.\n\nThat said, the extent to which this rally can be sustained beyond a few days remains to be seen. Once a spot Bitcoin ETF is launched (and maybe a similar Ethereum option), it\'s unclear whether the bullish momentum that\'s driven valuations higher can continue. Indeed, it could be the latest "buy the rumor, sell the news" event. We\'ll see.\n\nIt\'s my view that now may be a good time to take a cautious view of this space and wait for the dust to settle before stepping in. These three tokens have made nice moves over the past week, for sure. Let\'s just see whether these gains will be held before jumping in to ride this latest leg higher.'}]

REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the ETH market is currently experiencing a bearish trend with potential for further decline. The sell signals in the MACD analysis and fluctuating market indicators suggest a lack of bullish momentum in the short term. 

Contrastingly, the news analyst report paints a more optimistic picture for ETH, highlighting a surge in buying activity and positive market sentiment driven by potential developments such as the approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF and new projects on the Ethereum ecosystem. The bullish outlook in the short to medium term is supported by the presence of supply pressure near $1,800 and the majority of ETH holders being in a profitable position.

In reflecting on the reports, it is clear that a long-term trading strategy based on on-chain analysis and key indicators has been effective in maximizing profit and managing risks successfully. While short-term gains may be possible, a moderately conservative approach is recommended to navigate the current market volatility and uncertainty.

Considering the mixed sentiment in the market and the importance of long-term strategies, I would take a slightly conservative approach and assign a trading action of 0.3. This reflects my confidence in the bullish trend in the short to medium term, while also acknowledging the potential for short-term pullbacks and the need to manage risk effectively.

After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market has been experiencing a bearish trend with sell signals in the MACD analysis and fluctuating open prices. The news analyst report, on the other hand, presents a bullish outlook for Ethereum, citing significant gains in Vitalik Buterin's crypto portfolio and a potential rally in the market. The delay of the Dencun upgrade is noted as a potential short-term negative factor.

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a long-term strategy based on on-chain analysis and key indicators has been effective in maximizing profit and managing risks successfully. While short-term market fluctuations may occur, a slightly conservative trading approach is recommended to navigate uncertainty and manage risks effectively.

Considering the mixed sentiment in the market and the potential for short-term volatility, it is important to prioritize a strategic and cautious approach to trading.

Despite general market apathy, the net TVL of 30 leading platforms added 32% in the last four months.\n\nEthereum L2s set new all-time high in TVL\n\nYesterday, Oct. 27, 2023, the aggregated value of cryptocurrency locked in all Layer-2 platforms on Ethereum (ETH) reached a new all-time high. It briefly touched $12 billion, but then stabilized near $11.87 billion. The previous historic high was registered on April 17, at $11.85 billion.\n\nImage by L2Beat\n\nIn the last hours, it slightly retraced to $11.81 billion. As such, in USD-denominated value, it added over 114% in the last 12 months despite the pale performance of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nIn terms of Ether-denominated value, the record was registered on Oct. 11, 2023. The ecosystem reached 6.72 million Ether (ETH) locked, while it barely surpassed 3.5 million Ether (ETH) a year ago.\n\nIn the last seven days, the ecosystem of L2s added 10.36% of dollar-denominated TVL. An array of the largest L2s — Arbitrum, OP Mainnet (formerly Optimism), Starknet, ImmutableX and Loopring — posted even more impressive gains.\n\nEthereum (ETH), the most crucial asset for L2s, is up by 10.14% in the corresponding period. It revisited a multi-month low over $1,836 two days ago.\n\nArbitrum, OP Mainnet remain undisputed, rivalry rages for #3\n\nMeanwhile, the sphere of L2s on Ethereum (ETH) remains highly "whale-dominated." The two largest networks — Arbitrum and OP Mainnet — are responsible for over 90% of TVL in the ecosystem.\n\nBase, the fastest-growing L2, is protecting the third position with 4.83%. It is followed by zkSync Era and dYdX with 3.8% and 3%, respectively.\n\nAs covered by U.Today previously, dYdX made the most anticipated announcement this week: It is migrating from the L2 model to being a standalone Tendermint-based Layer 1.'}, {'id': 18, 'time': 'Sat, 28 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum Price Prediction As Chart Analysis Hints Last Pullback Before a Leap to $2000 - CoinGape', 'content': 'Ethereum Price Prediction: In the past two weeks, the Ethereum price has mounted an impressive comeback, rising from $1,527 to a peak of $1,867—a 22.6% surge that has allowed it to reclaim crucial resistance levels at $1,600 and $1,700. Despite this, the asset is facing headwinds as Bitcoin struggles to break past the $35,000 mark, leading to increased selling pressure across the crypto market. This has caused the ETH recovery to stall around the $1,800 level, raising questions about an impending correction.\n\nAlso Read: Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital Going Long On Bitcoin And Ethereum: Lookonchain\n\nadvertisement\n\nWedge Pattern Governs the Current Correction Trend\n\nThe daily candles projecting rejecting wicks on either side reflect uncertainty among market participants.\n\nA bearish breakdown below the $1750 support put Ethereum coin 15% downside risk\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Ether is $6.6 Billion, indicating a 17% gain.\n\nSource- Tradingview\n\nOver the past seven months, the Ethereum coin price has witnessed a correction trend under the influence of a falling wedge pattern. The coin price rebounded thrice from each of the downsloping trendlines, indicating the strong influence this pattern has on market participants.\n\nThe latest recovery stalled around the pattern’s upper trendline, near the $1,850 mark, as sellers continue to defend this territory. The recent price action displays long-wick projections at this resistance level, suggesting that sellers are pressuring the asset for another downward correction.\n\nTaking a bearish outlook, a break below the $1,760 mark could catalyze increased selling, potentially driving the asset back down to the lower trendline near $1,500.\n\nWill ETH Price Regain $2000 Mark?\n\nWhile the current price behavior seems concerning the prevailing bullish sentiment has not been entirely extinguished. If the ETH price can maintain a price above $1,750, there might be an opportunity for buyers to break out from the falling wedge pattern’s upper trendline. Such a breakout would effectively signal the end of the ongoing correction phase, propelling buyers toward an extended recovery with a target at $2,030—an estimated upside of 14%.\n\nExponential Moving Average: A potential bullish crossover between the 20 and 100 EMA slope, could bolster buyers in maintaining current recovery trends.\n\nVortex Indicator: A positive crossover state between the VI+(blue) and VI-(pink) reflects market mood is still bullish.'}, {'id': 12, 'time': 'Sat, 28 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Top Analyst Says Solana on the Cusp of a Breakout, Will Outperform Bitcoin and Ethereum – Here’s His Outlook - The Daily Hodl', 'content': "A widely-followed crypto analyst says the Ethereum (ETH) rival Solana (SOL) is on the verge of another breakout that will outperform ETH and Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nPseudonymous crypto trader Bluntz tells his 225,000 followers on the social media platform X that SOL is one of his main “alt picks” and is set to run higher not only in USD terms but also versus BTC (SOL/BTC) and ETH (SOL/ETH).\n\n“SOL still one of my favorite alt picks right now.\n\nStructure on the USD pair looks very much impulsive and like an extended wave three underway and its BTC and ETH pair also still look like they are on the cusp of high timeframe accumulation breakouts.”\n\nBluntz utilizes the Elliot Wave Theory in his technical analysis. The theory aims to predict price impulses based on crowd psychology, which tends to manifest in waves. Based on his chart, the analyst suggests that SOL is in the midst of a five-wave impulse to the upside that could top out near the $47 range before making its next move.\n\nWhen asked why he’s so zeroed in on Solana, Bluntz says he’s confident that SOL will outperform BTC and ETH in the near future.\n\nLooking at Bitcoin, the trader says that BTC’s price action strongly suggests that more upside action is imminent and that a dip to $32,000 is unlikely at this point. He forecasts that BTC will make another impulse upward after consolidating within a bullish triangle pattern.\n\n“The fact that BTC is showing acceptance at these levels after that strong breakout of $32,000 is quite bullish in my opinion.\n\nI don’t think we retest $32,000 at all, too many people missed the move and want that retest and I don’t think the market will give it to them.\n\nI anticipate this to probably end up as a triangle and break higher.”\n\nAt time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $33,957.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

While both projects share many similarities, there are still major differences between them. Understanding the key differences between SOL and ETH can help investors and traders make informed decisions to maximize their investments. But what factors should one take into consideration when doing a Solana vs Ethereum analysis? Here, we deep dive into the key aspects that differentiate SOL from ETH and vice versa.\n\nAbout Solana\n\nSolana, or SOL, was created by software developer Anatoly Yakovenko, who first proposed the project in 2017 and finally launched it in 2020. The coin takes inspiration from Etherum and was eventually created to improve upon Etherum. Many crypto enthusiasts and experts considered Solana a potential ‘Ethereum killer.’\n\nSolana emerged as a new-generation crypto coin that addressed several shortcomings of popular tokens launched before it. The coin’s transactions are conducted on the Solana blockchain, which uses a proof-of-history consensus mechanism instead of a proof-of-work mechanism used by popular initial coins like Bitcoin.\n\nIn layman’s terms, the proof-of-work mechanism depends on miners to unearth the next block and is slow and has a high energy demand. In comparison, the proof-of-history consensus mechanism is fast and requires 99.9% less energy. This is one of the main reasons why Solana took on the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum right from the beginning.\n\nAbout Ethereum\n\nEthereum, or ETH, which was first proposed by Vitalik Buterin in his white paper in 2013, was finally launched in 2015. Buterin was joined by Gavin Wood, Charles Hoskinson, Amir Chetrit, Anthony Di Iorio, Jeffrey Wilcke, Joseph Lubin, and Mihai Alisie, who further developed and popularised the project its way to the second-largest blockchain project in the world, only behind Bitcoin.\n\nETH is the native currency of Ethereum, a decentralized blockchain that offers smart contract functionality. However, the project was also plagued with issues related to proof-of-work until September 2022, when it shifted to a proof-of-stake mechanism. The move helped it become more fast and reduced its energy needs by over 99%, making it more efficient.\n\nSolana Vs. Ethereum : An Overview\n\nSolana and Ethereum are two of the most widely used crypto tokens globally. But to better understand how these two crypto coins are pitting against each other, we have taken several factors into consideration to provide you with a detailed snapshot.\n\nGoogle Trends: Solana Vs Ethereum\n\nGoogle Trends is one of the key metrics to determine the interest of crypto enthusiasts in particular coins. For the past 12 months in 2023, Ethereum clearly has the edge over Solana in terms of search volumes and interest of the global crypto community.\n\nCaption: Interest over time of Solana and Ethereum {Solana (Blue); Ethereum (Red)}\n\nActive Addresses: Solana Vs. Ethereum\n\nActive Addresses is another important metric that can give you an insight into the adoption of a coin. In simple terms, an active address is a crypto address that has become a direct participant in a successful transaction. It can be either the sender’s or receiver’s address.\n\nActive Addresses Solana\n\nSolana’s active addresses, which peaked at around 39.64 million in April 2022, are nowhere close to its days of glory. However, the token has witnessed a decent rise in active addresses in the last 30 days. In October 2023, active addresses on Solana stood at 5.33 million as of 28 October.\n\nActive Addresses Ethereum\n\nThere’s no doubt that Ethereum is a more popular crypto coin than Solana. Therefore, naturally, the former has a more stable number of active addresses than the latter. In October, Ethereum’s number of active addresses was 10.35 million as of 28 October.\n\nMonthly Transactions (Solana & Ethereum)\n\nMonthly transactions in crypto refer to the buying, selling, and exchanging of digital currencies within a given month. Comparing Ethereum and Solana’s monthly transactions will help you understand which coin is being preferred for transactions by crypto enthusiasts.\n\nSolana Monthly Transactions\n\nNon-vote Solana transactions peaked in November 2021 at 1.5 billion. The last time it was near the 1 billion mark was in July 2022. The number of non-vote transactions has kept fluctuating since then. In October, the number of non-vote transactions showed improvement. As of 28 October, the number of non-vote transactions was up at 550.4 million from 494.7 million in September and 519.83 million in August 2023.\n\nEthereum Monthly Transactions\n\nIn terms of monthly transactions, Ethereum made a record in May 2021, when the token was involved in 20.27 transactions. While ETH’s number of transactions has fallen since then, it has remained stable in the range of 12 million to 17 million. However, in October, the number of Ethereum-based transactions could see a serious fa...'}]

"""
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the ETH market is currently experiencing a bearish trend with potential for further decline. The sell signals in the MACD analysis and fluctuating market indicators suggest a lack of bullish momentum in the short term. 

Contrastingly, the news analyst report paints a more optimistic picture for ETH, highlighting a surge in buying activity and positive market sentiment driven by potential developments such as the approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF and new projects on the Ethereum ecosystem. The bullish outlook in the short to medium term is supported by the presence of supply pressure near $1,800 and the majority of ETH holders being in a profitable position.

In reflecting on the reports, it is clear that a long-term trading strategy based on on-chain analysis and key indicators has been effective in maximizing profit and managing risks successfully. While short-term gains may be possible, a moderately conservative approach is recommended to navigate the current market volatility and uncertainty.

Considering the mixed sentiment in the market and the importance of long-term strategies, I would take a slightly conservative approach and assign a trading action of 0.3.

Considering the mixed sentiment in the market and potential for short-term volatility, a slightly conservative trading approach is warranted to effectively manage risks and align with long-term trends. Key trends to monitor include the MACD analysis, open prices, and any significant developments in the Ethereum ecosystem.

In conclusion, the overall market trend for ETH appears to be bearish in the near future, despite recent positive developments. Therefore, I will take a slightly conservative approach and sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.5 to manage risks appropriately and align with the potential bearish market trend.

But things are not a given, as bulls need to defend a few key levels before they’re in the clear. Investors need to watch the key barriers to know where ETH will head next.\n\nEthereum price at critical point\n\nEthereum (ETH) price has cleared the $1,650, $1,670 and $1,727 hurdles as it rallied 19% between October 19 and 25. This move created a local top at $1,865 and is contemplating its next move.\n\nGoing forward, investors can expect Ethereum price to retrace the aforementioned barriers and finda support. This move will allow the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) to reset at the 50 mean level, further adding credence to the bullish thesis.\n\nA strong bounce could send Ethereum price to tag the $2,000 psychological level as well as the range high at $2,030. The last time ETH tried to overcome this hurdle in mid-April, it failed. So, a move into this zone will be critical for the long-term outlook of the smart contract token.\n\nClearing the $2,030 hurdle or flipping it into a support floor will open the path to the next key resistance level at $2,424.\n\nRead more: Ethereum’s Dencun upgrade is a step toward a scalable settlement layer: Goldman Sachs\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nWhile the bullish outlook makes logical sense, it is dependent on Ethereum price holding above the $1,727 barrier. A daily candlestick close below this level that leads to a breakdown of the $1,650 support level will invalidate the bullish thesis.\n\nIn such a case, Ethereum price could revisit $1,551 or slide lower to collect the sell-side liquidity resting below swing lows formed on September 10 and October 10.\n\nAlso read: Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: Crypto markets turn bullish on ETF approval hopes'}, {'id': 8, 'time': 'Sun, 29 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Cosmos outpaces Bitcoin and Ethereum – this metric rises 182% - AMBCrypto News', 'content': 'Comsos’ active users increased by 182% in the last 30 days.\n\nThe project was shifting market sentiment at press time.\n\nOver the last 30 days, Daily Active Users on Cosmos [ATOM] grew by 182%, data by Token Terminal revealed. Thus, the number of active addresses grew at a faster pace compared to Bitcoin [BTC], Ethereum [ETH], and Coinbase’s L2 Base.\n\nRealistic or not, here’s ATOM’s market cap in BTC’s terms\n\nIt seemed necessary to compare Cosmos to Bitcoin and Ethereum because they are the top two blockchains, in a nutshell. For Base, since its introduction, it has amassed a lot of adoption.\n\nHowever, the hype and activity around Base has dropped significantly. In fact, Token Terminal showed that the project’s Daily Active Users reduced by 12.5%.\n\nThe Daily Active Users can offer vital information about a network’s health. Aside from being a metric that measures user adoption, the metric can indicate a shift in market sentiment. Sometimes, it also has a big impact on token prices.\n\nMore data transport, more growth\n\nSurprisingly, Cosmos’ native token ATOM did not feel the impact of the active user growth. At press time, the ATOM’s value was $7.02— a similar price it was 30 days back.\n\nOne of the factors that influenced the increase could be linked to the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol expansion to the Binance Smart Chain. The IBC is an open-source protocol developed to handle the movement of data between blockchains.\n\nBased on AMBCrypto’s report a few weeks ago, the expansion would also offer more opportunities for those involved in staking ATOM. Besides that, Cosmos is also making movies to ensure that it lasts long in the list of blockchains with a good level of development activity.\n\nThe project seems to be using its builders’ program to this effect.\n\nSentiment goes sideways\n\nInterestingly, Santiment’s data showed that the efforts are paying off for Comsos, as indicated by the Development Activity metric. Development Activity shows the commitment of developers to ensure the proper functioning of a network.\n\nAt press time, Cosmos’ development had jumped to 16.22. This means that there has been an increase in the number of features shipped via the project. Cosmos also experienced an up-and-down trend in terms of market awareness.\n\nTo measure perception, on-chain platform Santiment uses the Weighted Sentiment metric. This metric tracks the positive/commentary about a project via social media platforms.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ATOMs worth today?\n\nAn increase in Weighted Sentiment means a surge in positive comments. Conversely, a decrease means a growing negative perception.\n\nFrom the data above, Cosmos’ Weighted Sentiment was 0.365. Looking at the chart, the comments about the project were largely positive as of press time. However, the optimism seemed to be waning.'}]

The Ethereum (ETH) price has experienced a significant rally, clearing key resistance levels and potentially heading towards $2,000 and beyond. However, it is crucial for ETH to maintain support above $1,727 and $1,650 to sustain its bullish momentum. On the other hand, Cosmos (ATOM) has seen a notable increase in active users, indicating growing adoption and market sentiment. Despite the lack of price movement for ATOM, the expansion of the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol and development efforts suggest a positive outlook for Cosmos.

"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market has been experiencing a bearish trend with sell signals in the MACD analysis and fluctuating open prices. The news analyst report, on the other hand, presents a bullish outlook for Ethereum, citing significant gains in Vitalik Buterin's crypto portfolio and a potential rally in the market. The delay of the Dencun upgrade is noted as a potential short-term negative factor.

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a long-term strategy based on on-chain analysis and key indicators has been effective in maximizing profit and managing risks successfully. While short-term market fluctuations may occur, a slightly conservative trading approach is recommended to navigate uncertainty and manage risks effectively.

Considering the mixed sentiment in the market and the potential for short-term volatility, it is important to prioritize a strategic and cautious approach to trading. Therefore, I would take a slightly conservative trading action with a confidence level of 0.3 to reflect the need for risk management and the emphasis on long-term strategies over short-term gains.

REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that ETH has been on a downward trend with decreasing open prices, decreasing number of successful transactions, and a bearish MACD signal. This indicates a potential bearish market trend in the near future. On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights positive developments in the cryptocurrency market leading to increased volatility and trading activity, with a cautious outlook on the sustainability of the current rally. 

Reflecting on my trading performance, it is evident that a long-term strategy based on on-chain analysis and key indicators has been effective in maximizing profit and managing risks successfully. Short-term news reports have led to some losses in profit due to conflicting signals and market fluctuations. Therefore, it is crucial to prioritize on-chain analysis over short-term news reports to make informed trading decisions.

Considering the mixed sentiment in the market and potential for short-term volatility, a slightly conservative trading approach is warranted to effectively manage risks and align with long-term trends. Key trends to monitor include the MACD analysis, open prices, and any significant developments in the Ethereum ecosystem.

In conclusion, the overall market trend for ETH appears to be bearish in the near future, despite recent positive developments. Therefore, I will take a slightly conservative approach and sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.5 to manage risks appropriately and align with the potential bearish market trend.

ETH corrected lower below $1,800, but the bulls remained active near $1,750.\n\nA low was formed near $1,741 and the price is now making a fresh attempt to gain pace, like Bitcoin.

They presented a range of scenarios, with the most conservative estimate being $9.81 and the most optimistic projection reaching a remarkable $3,211.28, depicting a 10,000% surge in price.\n\nOne of the most compelling aspects of VanEck’s prediction is their belief that Solana could become the first blockchain to host an application that onboards over 100 million users. As per the firm, this achievement would be a significant milestone in the blockchain industry and a game-changer for SOL’s adoption and value.\n\nNotably, the report assumed that Solana will monetize at only 20% of Ethereum’s take rate, indicating that even a relatively modest market share could result in substantial returns for SOL token holders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurthermore, the firm suggested that Solana might achieve less than half of Ethereum’s market share due to fundamental differences in community philosophy. This perspective highlights that while Ethereum emphasizes decentralization and community governance, Solana has taken a more pragmatic approach to scalability and speed, which could attract a different set of users and developers.\n\nVanEck’s optimistic outlook is based on its vision of a credible path to $8 billion in revenues for SOL token holders by 2030. If this prediction materializes, it would not only be a significant achievement for Solana but also a testament to the growth and potential of the broader blockchain ecosystem.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has been characterized by its volatility and rapid changes, making long-term predictions a challenging endeavour. However, VanEck has positioned itself to take on the crypto market with safer vehicles.\n\nLast Friday, the New York-based firm submitted a revised application for the highly-anticipated Bitcoin Spot ETF, aligning itself with industry leaders such as BlackRock, Ark Invest, and Fidelity, all eager to capitalize on the promising future of the world’s largest cryptocurrency.\n\nAt press time, SOL was trading at $34.65, marking an impressive 6.8% gain in the last 24 hours, possibly spurred by the recent report. Notably, the cryptocurrency has been the top performer among the top 20 coins in the past week, with a substantial 19% increase, according to CoinMarketCap data.'}, {'id': 13, 'time': 'Mon, 30 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Dogecoin, Ethereum, and Everlodge Poised to Surge: Here's Why - CryptoPotato", 'content': 'Dogecoin, Ethereum, and Everlodge are amongst the more interesting altcoins to watch in the ongoing crypto rally.\n\nAlbeit different, all of these projects are attempting to position themselves the best they can for what seems to be a much-anticipated bull market.\n\nSummary:\n\nDogecoin’s price pumps 5.2%.\n\nAli Martinez predicts Ethereum to reach $1,900.\n\nEverlodge’s price has increased from $0.02 to $0.023.\n\nVisit the Everlodge presale and win a luxury holiday to the Maldives\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) Aiming To Surpass the $0.07 Level\n\nDogecoin, the original meme coin has been popular ever since its launch back in 2021. Dogecoin quickly climbed up the ranks after being promoted by top figures like Elon Musk. The meme coin hit an all-time high of $0.7376 in May 2021 before plummeting to the $0.06 level in October 2023.\n\nDespite this significant price drop, Dogecoin still remains a top ten largest crypto ranked by market capitalization. As of the time of this writing, the price of Dogecoin recently jumped by 7.7% to reach $0.069.\n\nAlso, there was an increase in DOGE’s trading volume, highlighting increasing support for the meme coin. As a result, some analysts have predicted that the Dogecoin price could aim for the $0.07 mark and potentially surpass it in the coming days.\n\nEthereum (ETH) To Reach $1,900\n\nOn October 20th, crypto analyst, Ali Martinez, told his Twitter followers that Ethereum is heading for the $1,900 level. According to the analysts, ETH has formed an ascending triangle pattern, which is a bullish formation.\n\nAli said Ethereum is “ready” to bounce off the ascending triangle’s hypotenuse. Moreover, the analyst emphasized that the Ethereum coin must close above the 18-day SMA (around $1,745) to reach $1,900. As of October 30th, the price of Ethereum has increased by 8.1% in the past week to hit $1,818.\n\nEthereum’s price has shown great recovery together with the rest of the crypto market. Meanwhile, the last time Ethereum reached $1,900 was in July 2023.\n\nEverlodge (ELDG) Captures Whale Attention With Unique Features\n\nJust like Dogecoin and Ethereum, investors in the Everlodge presale are sweeping tokens. Everlodge is working on a blockchain real estate marketplace. It will allow more people to invest in vacation homes, hotels, and fancy villas.\n\nWhat makes Everlodge unique over traditional platforms is its NFT fractionalization approach to property co-ownership.

Besides, users get extra benefits on the platform.\n\nIn addition, investors can trade their NFTs on Everlodge or other ERC-20 compatible marketplaces.

The news articles suggest a mixed outlook for Ethereum (ETH) in the cryptocurrency market. While some analysts predict a potential surge in price towards $2,000 for ETH, others highlight the need for the coin to stay above key support levels to avoid further declines. Additionally, the prediction of Solana outperforming Ethereum in terms of returns by 2030 adds an interesting dynamic to the market.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that ETH has been on a downward trend with decreasing open prices, decreasing number of successful transactions, and a bearish MACD signal. This indicates a potential bearish market trend in the near future. On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights positive developments in the cryptocurrency market leading to increased volatility and trading activity, with a cautious outlook on the sustainability of the current rally. 

Reflecting on my trading performance, it is evident that a long-term strategy based on on-chain analysis and key indicators has been effective in maximizing profit and managing risks successfully. Short-term news reports have led to some losses in profit due to conflicting signals and market fluctuations. Therefore, it is crucial to prioritize on-chain analysis over short-term news reports to make informed trading decisions.

Considering the mixed sentiment in the market and potential for short-term volatility, a slightly conservative trading approach is warranted to effectively manage risks and align with long-term trends. Key trends to monitor include the MACD analysis, open prices, and any significant developments in the Ethereum ecosystem.

In conclusion, the overall market trend for ETH appears to be bearish in the near future, despite recent positive developments. Therefore, I will take a slightly conservative approach and sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.5 to manage risks appropriately and align with the potential bearish market trend.
ACTION:
-0.5
DAILY RETURN:
-0.0028148105558432057
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the current data indicates a bearish trend for ETH in the short term. The decrease in open price, total gas used, unique addresses, total value transferred, and successful transactions, along with the fluctuating average gas price and the sell signal on the MACD, all point towards a downward trend.

On the other hand, the news analyst report presents a more positive outlook for Ethereum, highlighting the increase in total value locked in second-layer solutions and the potential price breakout if ETH can maintain a price above $1,750. Additionally, the bullish sentiment towards alternative cryptocurrencies like Solana suggests a positive market trend.

In reflection of the reports, it is clear that a long-term strategy based on on-chain analysis has been effective in maximizing profit and managing risks successfully. Short-term news reports have led to some losses due to conflicting signals and market fluctuations. Therefore, it is crucial to prioritize on-chain analysis over short-term news reports to make informed trading decisions.

Considering the mixed sentiment in the market and the potential for short-term volatility, a slightly conservative trading approach is warranted to effectively manage risks and align with long-term trends. Therefore, I would recommend a cautious and strategic approach to capitalize on profitable opportunities while minimizing potential losses.

Based on the synthesized reports and the emphasis on long-term strategies, I would take a trading action with a confidence level of 0.3, indicating a slightly bearish outlook in the short term but with a focus on long-term growth potential.

[{'id': 9, 'time': 'Tue, 31 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Bankrupt FTX moves $156M worth of assets including Ethereum and Solana - CryptoSlate', 'content': 'Blockchain analytics firm Nansen reported that wallets connected to bankrupt FTX have moved up to $156 million worth of digital assets, including Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), in several transactions over the past week.\n\nUnstakes Solana\n\nIn an Oct. 31 post on X (formerly Twitter), Nansen reported that FTX began unstaking 1.6 mill SOL tokens, worth approximately $57.6 million, on Oct. 30.\n\nWhile the unstaked assets are currently held in the staking wallet, FTX’s fund movement will increase the total SOL transferred to nearly $90 million.\n\nEarlier in the month, FTX liquidators staked approximately $120 million in Solana tokens through Figment, an institutional staking service provider. This move is anticipated to yield up to 7% return in staking rewards and is expected to help the bankrupt firm maximize its assets.\n\n$156M transferred\n\nNansen, while adding FTX’s recently unstaked Solana assets to the stream of transactions from the insolvent company to crypto exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, estimated a movement of approximately $156 million worth of digital assets.\n\nAccording to Nansen’s analysis, the new wave of transactions included 1,100 ETH valued at $2 million, 10.5 million USDC, and 7.6 million Render tokens worth $500,000.\n\nFTX also transferred 833,000 Kyber Network Crystal (KNC) tokens, equivalent to $616,000, and 108 million TRUE tokens worth $420,000. Further assets included 138,000 Band Protocol tokens valued at $221,000, 2.5 million The Graph tokens equivalent to $273,000, 845 Maker tokens valued at $1.17 million, and 9.5 million REN tokens worth $500,000.\n\nAdditionally, there were 695,000 Perpetual Protocol Tokens valued at $423,000, 767,000 Biconomy Tokens worth $182,000, and 23,000 Polygon tokens worth $15,000.\n\nFTX claims value rise\n\nPrices for FTX claims increased following reports of a $2 billion investment by Google in the artificial intelligence startup Anthropic.\n\nIkigai hedge fund manager Travis Kling posited that the investment had driven “FTX bankruptcy pretty close to a full recovery.”\n\nIn an interview with CryptoSlate, Thomas Braziel, an expert on FTX claims at 117 Partners, urged creditors to remain cautious. This was reiterated in a post on X (formerly Twitter), where he highlighted that there was no valuation mentioned in the Google-Anthropic investment, adding that:\n\n“Great to see this news tonight but the bankruptcy still have a big road ahead of it.”\n\nData from Cherokee Acquisition shows that the claim’s value has risen to between 50 and 53 cents on the dollar as of press time.'}, {'id': 7, 'time': 'Tue, 31 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'dYdX Chain Goes Live, Moves Token Away from Ethereum - DailyCoin', 'content': 'Unveiling of L1 token DYDX, a pivotal step in dYdX Chain’s growth.\n\nEnhanced network security and governance with the new L1 token.\n\nOpportunities for community engagement and revenue generation through staking.\n\nWhile Ethereum provides a reliable platform for thousands of blockchain projects, many eventually move to their native tokens. Most recently, the dYdX Chain has marked a significant milestone by launching a native chain and moving to an L1 token, DYDX.\n\nThe project departed from its previous ERC-20 token framework on Ethereum’s layer two protocol. The project says the migration means better network governance, heightened security, and functionality, and a new revenue distribution model for validators and stakers.\n\ndYdX Chain’s Transition to L1 Token, DYDX\n\nOn Wednesday, October 26, the dYdX Chain mainnet finally went live after the unveiling of its new L1 token. The first block was created by the Genesis Validators, as announced by the Operations subDAO (Ops subDAO). The move is a significant paradigm shift from its previous reliance on an ERC-20 token on Ethereum’s layer two protocol.\n\nThis transition, following a community vote, expands the staking opportunities, which aims to bolster the blockchain. Moreover, the project claims that the shift amplifies the protocol’s governance capabilities and reallocates the protocol’s revenue streams.\n\nThrough this transition, the dYdX Chain says its framework will be more closely with the decentralized ethos of blockchain technology. The L1 token also marks a step towards a self-sustained, community-driven blockchain ecosystem. Importantly, all fees collected by the protocol, which include trading fees denominated in USDC and gas fees for DYDX-denominated transactions or USDC-denominated transactions, are distributed to Validators and Stakers, creating a direct financial benefit for network participants.\n\nWhat Is dYdX?\n\nAt its core, dYdX is a leading decentralized exchange supporting perpetual trading. It operates on smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, allowing users to trade without intermediaries.\n\nThe project’s features include perpetual trading on Layer-2 with up to 20x leverage, offering pairs like BTC-USD, ETH-USD, and LINK-USD, among others\u200b2\u200b. This aspect of dYdX demonstrates its commitment to providing advanced financial services in a decentralized manner.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nEthereum, where dYdX initially operated, is one of the most decentralized networks in the blockchain space.\n\ndYdX Chain might face an uphill battle to prove its chain is more decentralized than Ethereum.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nThe emergence of dYdX Chain and its L1 Token, dYDx, is a significant stride towards achieving a self-sustainable and community-governed blockchain ecosystem. It showcases the potential for blockchain projects to evolve and adapt to community needs while enhancing network security and governance.\n\nRead more about decentralized exchanges like dYdX:\n\nDecentralized Exchanges: Crypto’s Wild West or Blockchain Essential?\n\n\n\nRead more about Solana’s positive performance:\n\nUnpacking Solana’s 7% Price Jump: What You Need to Know'}, {'id': 18, 'time': 'Tue, 31 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum Bearish Signal: MVRV Has Entered The “Danger” Zone - NewsBTC', 'content': 'On-chain data shows the Ethereum Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio has entered inside a danger zone that has historically led to tops.\n\nEthereum MVRV Ratio Has Surged Into The Danger Zone Recently\n\nIn its latest insight post, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has talked about some underlying metrics related to ETH. First, the firm has pointed out how the trading volume of the cryptocurrency has gone down since Ethereum’s surge from a few days back.\n\nThe value of the metric has been sharply going down recently | Source: Santiment\n\nThe trading volume observing a significant decline while the price is trying to continue its rally could indicate that momentum is weakening for the cryptocurrency.\n\nOne positive for the asset, though, could be the fact that the supply on exchanges has gone down since the rally started, implying that the investors have made net withdrawals.\n\nLooks like the metric has plunged | Source: Santiment\n\nGenerally, investors transfer their Ethereum out of these central entities to hold onto it in self-custodial wallets for extended periods, so this decline in the supply on exchanges could be a sign of fresh accumulation.\n\nFollowing the latest rise in the asset, its social dominance has also seen a jump. The “social dominance” here refers to the mindshare that Ethereum occupies on social media platforms among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap.\n\nInterest around ETH has grown in the last few days | Source: Santiment\n\nIt would appear that more eyes have been turning at Ethereum recently, which can be a sign that hype is building up among the traders. Historically, too much hype has been negative for the asset, as it has often led to top formations.\n\nSo far, though, the social dominance is still notably below the levels it was at when ETH hit its local top at the start of this month, as is apparent in the above chart. According to Santiment, this “may suggest there can be some room for it to go before things cool down.”\n\nA signal that is more concretely bearish for Ethereum, however, is the 30-day MVRV ratio. In simple terms, what this ratio tells us is how the value that investors are holding (the market cap) compares against the capital that they invested into the asset (the realized cap).\n\nThe indicator appears to have entered the danger zone | Source: Santiment\n\nHere, Santiment has used the 30-day MVRV ratio, which means this indicator only keeps track of the investors/addresses who bought their coins within the last 30 days.\n\nAs shown in the chart, this Ethereum indicator has recently risen into a territory that the analytics firm labels as a “danger zone.” Historically, the price has seen a correction not too long after the metric has reached this zone so another local top may be due for Ethereum right now.\n\nETH Price\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at around $1,800, up 1% in the past week.\n\nETH has been stuck in consolidation recently | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Kanchanara on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, Santiment.net\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

It was the first protocol to introduce this game-changing technology, enabling the creation of self-executing contracts with predefined rules and conditions.\n\nThis innovation laid the foundation for the entire DeFi ecosystem, as it provided the framework for decentralized applications and automated transactions.\n\nOne of the most compelling indicators of Ethereum’s continued dominance is the recent surge in decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes.\n\nIn the past week, Ethereum recorded a historic milestone, with over $9 billion in transactions settled on its network. This marks the highest weekly volume since mid-June and underscores the platform’s pivotal role in facilitating peer-to-peer trading and liquidity provision.\n\n.@ethereum dominated this week’s TVL growth rankings, accounting for $6.68B of the total $8.76B TVL growth across crypto last week. pic.twitter.com/45rqb3Seml — 0xScope (🪬 . 🪬) (@ScopeProtocol) October 30, 2023\n\nETH Price Dynamics And The BlackRock Factor\n\nAs Ethereum continues to take center stage in the crypto landscape, the question on many investors’ minds is how this data will impact the price of ETH. Currently, according to CoinGecko, Ethereum is trading at $1,798, showing a modest 0.6% increase in the last 24 hours, with a minor 0.9% decrease over the past seven days.\n\nVenture capitalist Arthur Cheong has provided intriguing insights into the potential price trajectory of Ethereum. Cheong, the founder of DeFiance Capital, suggests that ETH could experience a significant rally if a specific scenario unfolds.\n\nHe points to BlackRock, a financial giant, and its application for a spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF). If BlackRock’s BTC ETF application is successful, it could pave the way for a similar Ethereum ETF application in the future.\n\n“ETH is probably the best six to 12 month long among large-cap assets now when BlackRock applies for a spot ETH ETF six to 12 months down the road,” Cheong wrote on the social media platform X.\n\nETH is probably the best 6 to 12m long among large cap assets now when BlackRock applies for spot ETH ETF 6 to 12m down the road. Ethereum’s ESG friendliness and native staking yield will be appealing to institutional investors should BTC spot ETF turn out to be a success. — Arthur (@Arthur_0x) October 24, 2023\n\nETHUSD currently trading at $1798.3 on the daily chart: TradingView.com\n\nImplications And Future Prospects\n\nThe significance of Ethereum’s role in DeFi and blockchain technology cannot be overstated. Its smart contract functionality revolutionized the crypto space and enabled the birth of countless decentralized applications and platforms. The recent surge in DEX volumes underscores its pivotal role in facilitating crypto trading.\n\nAs the crypto world closely watches developments surrounding BlackRock’s potential ETFs, Ethereum’s future appears promising. Should a BTC spot ETF materialize and pave the way for an Ethereum ETF, institutional investors may flock to Ethereum for its ESG attributes and staking yield opportunities.\n\n(This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice.

Buterin also highlights “almost-EVMs” like zkSync, extensions like Arbitrum Stylus and zero-knowledge proof pioneers Starknet as important players driving scaling technology for the ecosystem:\n\n“One of the inevitable consequences of this is that we are seeing a trend of layer 2 projects becoming more heterogeneous. I expect this trend to continue, for a few key reasons.”\n\nButerin notes that some projects currently existing as independent layer 1s are looking to bring themselves closer to the Ethereum ecosystem and potentially become ecosystem layer 2s.\n\nRelated: Polygon’s ‘holy grail’ Ethereum-scaling zkEVM beta hits mainnet\n\nThis type of transition remains difficult, as an “all at once” approach would cause a decrease in usability given that technology is not at a stage where it can be completely included in rollup technology. Meanwhile, postponing such a transition runs the risk of “sacrificing momentum and being too late to be meaningful.”\n\nButerin also notes that some centralized, non-Ethereum projects want to give users greater security assurances and are looking to blockchain-based solutions. Historically, these types of projects would have looked to “permissioned consortium chains” to achieve this:\n\n“Realistically, they probably only need a “halfway-house” level of decentralization. Additionally, their often very high level of throughput makes them unsuitable even for rollups, at least in the short term.”\n\nLastly, Buterin considers non-financial applications like games and social media platforms that want to be decentralized but do not need high levels of security. Highlighting a social media use case, Buterin notes that different parts of the app would require separate functionality:\n\n“Rare and high-value activity like username registration and account recovery should be done on a rollup, but frequent and low-value activity like posts and votes need less security.“\n\nHe adds that a chain failure leading to a user’s post disappearing would be an “acceptable cost,” while a similar failure leading to the loss of an account would be far more serious.\n\nRelated: Vitalik Buterin voices concerns over DAOs approving ETH staking pool operators\n\nButerin also notes that the costs associated with paying for rollup fees might not be acceptable for non-blockchain users, while previous blockchain users are used to paying far higher prices for on-chain interactions.\n\nAn excerpt from Buterin’s latest blog post on the Ethereum ecosystem titled “Different types of layer 2s.” Source: vitalik.eth.limo\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder then delves into the trade-offs between different rollup solutions and systems that offer varying scaling capabilities to the ecosystem. The “connectedness” to Ethereum hinges on the security of withdrawing to Ethereum from layer 2s and the security of reading data from the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nRelated: Ethereum’s proto-danksharding to make rollups 10x cheaper — Consensys zkEVM Linea head\n\nButerin notes that high security and tight connectedness are important for some applications, while others require something looser in exchange for greater scalability:\n\n“In many cases, starting with something looser today, and moving to a tighter coupling over the next decade as technology improves, may well be optimal.”\n\nEthereum’s next scheduled hard fork is set to introduce EIP-4844, commonly referred to as “proto-dank sharding.” The EIP is expected to drastically increase the amount of data availability of the network. Buterin also notes that improvements in data compression enable greater functionality.\n\nMagazine: Ethereum restaking: Blockchain innovation or dangerous house of cards?'}]

For comparison, Ethereum averages 12.6 TPS, a 1.6% increase over the same period.\n\nEthereum posted a brief spike to 18.8 TPS on Sept. 13 — buoyed by users bridging assets over to Base — but has consistently trended near 12 TPS throughout 2023.\n\nEthereum Mainnet Reclaims Dominance From Layer 2s\n\nL2 hype dies down\n\nMuch of the Layer 2 drawdown can be attributed to freshly deployed networks experiencing a retraction in activity after an initial wave of hype and incentives.\n\nThe initial frenzy of activity on Base, Coinbase’s OP Stack-based L2, has well and truly died down following its August mainnet launch. Base is now processing just at 3 transactions per second, down from 21.3 TPS on Sept. 14.\n\nZkSync Era’s throughput has slumped 50% since peaking at 15.2 TPS on Aug 26, despite Era now leading the Layer 2 sector by activity. Starknet is also down 53% from its Sep. 9 high at 4.7 TPS.\n\nThe top L2s by total value locked, long-standing incumbents Arbitrum and Optimism, suffered similar retracements. Arbitrum closely follows ZkSync Era with 7.3 TPS, down from a record high of 31.6 TPS amid the airdrop for its ARB token in March.\n\nThe OP Mainnet currently sits at 2.5 TPS, down from 10.4 in late July. However, the OP Labs team has since shifted its focus to supporting other L2s, including Base, with its OP Stack.\n\nDespite the pull-back, Ethereum’s Layer 2 project is emerging has succeeded in its mission.\n\nLayer 2 networks are driving more than 4.6 times as much activity than Ethereum’s base layer, meaning Ethereum’s ecosystem is facilitating far greater throughput at a fraction of the cost compared to before its L2 sector took off.\n\nTo continue reading this as well as other DeFi and Web3 news, visit us at thedefiant.io'}, {'id': 21, 'time': 'Wed, 01 Nov 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "NVDA, AMD Boomed Thanks To Crypto Mining, But What Happened After Ethereum's Big Move From Proof-Of-Work ... - Nasdaq", 'content': "Semiconductor companies NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), known for their graphics processing units (GPUs), saw their stock prices benefiting from the boom in cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhat Happened: These GPUs, originally designed for high-end video game graphics, have now become essential for computationally intensive applications such as data centers, artificial intelligence, and the creation of crypto assets.\n\nCryptography and blockchain creation require substantial computational power, making GPUs an ideal choice for these tasks. In 2018, as cryptocurrency prices soared, miners rushed to purchase GPUs, driving up the stock prices of Nvidia and AMD. GPUs played a vital role in the creation and management of crypto assets, to the extent that Nvidia even introduced a dedicated lineup of chips specifically for crypto mining in early 2021.\n\nThe Merge and Proof-of-Stake Approach\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation on September 15, 2022, completed “The Merge” process, which means Ethereum was switched from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to Proof-of-Stake (PoW).\n\nWith this development, the validation of new transaction blocks no longer relies on hardware mining, making the millions of high-end graphics cards previously used for this purpose redundant. Consequently, a large number of these GPUs were expected to flood the used card market.\n\nHowever, since 2023, the AI industry experienced a remarkable upswing. With machine learning at the forefront, AI applications penetrated diverse sectors, capturing investors’ attention and fueling the sector’s success.\n\nAccording to PwC, the potential economic impact of AI is substantial, with an anticipated contribution of $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. This projection encompasses a $6.6 trillion boost in productivity and a staggering $9.1 trillion surge in consumption.\n\nWill The SEC Finally Approve Long-Awaited Bitcoin Spot ETF?

REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that there is a bearish market trend for ETH with indicators pointing towards a potential further price decline. The decrease in open price, total gas used, unique addresses, total value transferred, and successful transactions, along with the sell trend indicated by the MACD signal, all suggest caution is needed in trading ETH.

On the other hand, the news analyst report presents a more bullish outlook for Ethereum, highlighting a significant rally and potential for the price to surpass $2,000. However, it emphasizes the importance of maintaining key support levels to sustain this bullish momentum.

In reflection of the reports, it is clear that a long-term strategy based on on-chain analysis has been effective in maximizing profit and managing risks successfully. Short-term news reports may provide conflicting signals and lead to losses, highlighting the importance of prioritizing on-chain analysis for informed trading decisions.

Considering the mixed sentiment in the market and potential for short-term volatility, a slightly conservative trading approach is recommended to effectively manage risks and align with long-term growth potential.

Therefore, based on the synthesized reports and the emphasis on long-term strategies over short-term gains, I would take a cautious approach and assign a trading action of 0.3, reflecting moderate confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.

Completion today of a small 9-day flag reconfirms Oct 23 completion of right-angled expanding triangle $ETH.”\n\nBrandt’s statement about the completion of a small 9-day flag and a right-angled expanding triangle for Ethereum suggests a positive outlook. These chart patterns are commonly seen as bullish signals in classical technical analysis. Their completion indicates potential upward momentum for ETH, further supporting the predictions of a bullish streak in the near future.\n\nWill The SEC Finally Approve Long-Awaited Bitcoin Spot ETF?

The apex cryptocurrency has confidently surpassed the $35,000 resistance level, which had previously limited its upward movement over the past two weeks.\n\nSince the third quarter, MicroStrategy, founded by Michael Saylor, has added 6,067 Bitcoin (BTC) to its holdings, with another 155 acquired in October, according to the company’s November 1 results filing.\n\nAlthough the firm’s revenue increased by 3% year-on-year to $129.5 million over the quarter, it recorded a net loss of $143.4 million. Notably, digital asset impairment losses and income taxes accounted for $33.6 million and $109.6 million of the total net losses, respectively.\n\nDuring the third quarter (July 1 to September 30), while Bitcoin experienced a price decline of 11.5% from $30,480 to $26,970, MicroStrategy capitalized on this downward period by purchasing the 6,067 BTC at an average price of $27,590.\n\nCurrently, MicroStrategy’s BTC holdings amount to 158,245 BTC, with an original investment of $4.715 billion. The current value of the holdings stands at $5.640 billion, reflecting a 20% increase. However, had MicroStrategy invested the same amount in Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), they would now possess 3,971,678 ETH, resulting in a value of $7.40 billion, significantly higher than the current BTC holdings, data from blockchaincenter.net shows.\n\nWill The SEC Finally Approve Long-Awaited Bitcoin Spot ETF?

This ETH would be worth approximately $722.4 million, bringing the total value (with staking) to 4,359,138 ETH, equivalent to $8.127 billion.\n\nWhile MicroStrategy continues to benefit from the rise in Bitcoin’s value, the narrative raises the question of what might happen if the company were to invest in ETH at the present moment. If MicroStrategy were to trade its BTC for ETH, it could potentially hold 3,025,059 ETH. Moreover, the annual revenue from staking this amount would amount to approximately $282 million, showcasing the significant potential returns that could be achieved.\n\nPrice Action: At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $35,728.12, up 3.66% in the last 24 hours, according to Benzinga Pro.\n\nRead Next: Here’s How Much You Should Invest In Shiba Inu Today For A $1M Payday If SHIB Hits 1 Cent?\n\n© 2023 Benzinga.com.

This article will delve into why Bitcoin Spark and Ethereum could one of the gainers this cycle.\n\nEthereum - Layer Zero Potential\n\nEthereum, since its inception, has gained considerable attention due to powerful smart contracts and scalability. Experts believe that Ethereum has ‘Layer Zero potential,’ functioning as the foundation of DeFi that enables the existence of numerous other blockchains and applications to run on it.\n\nThe potential of Ethereum lies in its decentralized, secure, and scalable infrastructure for a new generation of applications. It enables the creation of smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and even other cryptocurrencies. Developers can build and launch their projects and create a thriving ecosystem of innovation within the Ethereum ecosystem. However, the Ethereum network can only process a limited number of transactions per second, leading to congestion and high fees during peak times. Once these obstacles are resolved, Ethereum is likely to be a top gainer this upcoming bull season.\n\nBitcoin Spark Fusing PoW and PoS\n\nBitcoin Spark is another contender for one of the biggest gainer this cycle, thanks to its innovative fusion of Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms. This combination aims to harness the strengths of both systems and mitigate their weaknesses, creating a more secure, efficient, and sustainable blockchain.\n\nPoW, used by Bitcoin, involves miners solving complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and create new blocks. While this system has proven secure, it is resource-intensive, leading to criticisms about its environmental impact. On the other hand, PoS, employed by Ethereum, allows coin holders to validate transactions based on the number of coins they hold and are willing to 'stake' as collateral. This system is less resource-intensive but has been criticized for potentially favoring the 'rich' who can stake more coins.\n\nBitcoin Spark's fusion of PoW and PoS aims to create a balance, offering the security of PoW with the efficiency of PoS. This innovative hybrid approach culminates in the Proof-of-Process (PoP) consensus mechanism and could make Bitcoin Spark a significant player in the cryptocurrency market, leading to substantial gains in this cycle.\n\nTraders Convinced Smartphone Mining Is The Next Big Thing\n\nThe rise of smartphone mining is another trend that traders are keeping a close eye on. As the name suggests, smartphone mining involves using smartphones to mine cryptocurrencies. This method makes mining more accessible to the masses, as it does not require expensive hardware or high energy consumption.\n\nThe potential of smartphone mining lies in its convenience and accessibility. With billions of smartphone users worldwide, the potential user base for smartphone mining is massive. Furthermore, smartphone mining apps are typically user-friendly, making it easy for even non-tech-savvy individuals to participate in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThis is where Bitcoin Spark convinces new but also veteran crypto traders to be on top of the next bull run with its innovative Spark App that will enable users to simply mine BTCS via their smartphones.\n\nBottom Line\n\nIn conclusion, the cryptocurrency market is dynamic and ever-evolving, with Bitcoin Spark and Ethereum potentially being the one of the gainers this cycle. Ethereum’s Layer Zero potential and the upcoming upgrades promise a more scalable and efficient platform, while Bitcoin Spark's fusion of PoW and PoS offers a balanced and innovative approach to blockchain technology.\n\nFor more information:\n\nWebsite: https://bitcoinspark.org/\n\nBuy BTCS: https://network.bitcoinspark.org/register\n\nThis post was authored by an external contributor and does not represent Benzinga's opinions and has not been edited for content.

The uncertainty in the market is also emphasized by the prediction of Solana outperforming Ethereum in the long term.

In reflection of the reports, it is evident that a long-term strategy based on on-chain analysis has been effective in maximizing profit and managing risks successfully. Prioritizing on-chain analysis over short-term news reports has led to better outcomes in trading decisions.

Considering the synthesized reports, the market trend for ETH appears to be bearish in the near future, with potential for short-term volatility. Therefore, a slightly conservative trading approach is warranted, focusing on long-term growth potential while managing risks appropriately.

Based on this analysis, I would take a trading action with a confidence level of -0.5, indicating a moderate bearish sentiment in the market and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.

While his illicit activities began in 2010, Castelluzo only transitioned to using Bitcoin (BTC) for narcotic transactions on darknets in 2013.\n\nCastelluzzo is currently serving concurrent 20-year federal and state prison sentences for drug distribution convictions.\n\n30k ETH bought at ICO\n\nWhat is particularly noteworthy is that Castelluzo initially acquired the 30,000 ETH during its Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in July 2014, using 15 BTC stemming from his illegal narcotics business. At the time, the 30,000 ETH was worth a mere $9,000, but its current value has surged to more than $54 million as of press time.\n\nIn addition to Ethereum, Castelluzo also obtained 30,000 Ethereum Classic (ETC) in 2016, which he used to acquire other cryptocurrencies.\n\nSubsequent to his arrest and incarceration, Castelluzzo attempted to launder the 30,000 ETH while in prison. However, U.S. authorities foiled this scheme by intercepting recorded prison telephone calls in 2021, ultimately leading to the seizure of the assets.\n\nU.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger stated:\n\n“The civil action we are taking today seeks to recover millions of dollars of cryptocurrency, which the defendant allegedly obtained from drug sales. Whether it’s as simple as bags of cash or as sophisticated as cryptocurrency, we will take the steps necessary to seize financial gains defendants obtain from criminal activity.”\n\nJames E.

When a stock’s or crypto’s RSI is above 70%, it’s considered to be overbought, which can be a sell signal for technical traders.\n\nBullish traders want to see Bitcoin’s RSI continue to lower and then for big bearish volume to come in and break the crypto up through $36,000, which could accelerate a move to the upside toward $40,000. Bearish traders want to see big bearish volume come in and break Bitcoin down below the eight-day exponential moving average, which would negate the crypto’s current uptrend.\n\nIt should be noted that a golden cross, which occurs when the 50-day SMA crosses above the 200-day, formed on Bitcoin’s chart on Oct. 29, which suggests the crypto is in a strong bull cycle.\n\nBitcoin has resistance above at $35,593 and at $38,105 and support below at $31,862 and at $31,418.\n\nThe Ethereum and Dogecoin Charts: Ethereum and Dogecoin have been consolidating sideways near the 200-day SMA, with Ethereum trading sideways above that area and Dogecoin under it. Both Ethereum and Dogecoin have been consolidating near the 200-day on decreasing volume, which like Bitcoin, indicates a larger move in one direction is on the horizon.\n\nWhile Ethereum is trading in an uptrend within its consolidating pattern, Dogecoin is trading in a tightening range, forming a triangle formation. If the cryptos break bullishly from their respective patterns, a more powerful move to the upside could be in the cards.\n\nBearish traders want to see Ethereum break down under the 200-day SMA and for Dogecoin to break down from the lower ascending trendline of the triangle. If either of those two things happens, downside pressure is likely to accelerate.\n\nEthereum has resistance above at $1,825 and at $1,937 and support below at $1,717 and at $1,615.\n\nDogecoin has resistance above at $0.069 and at $0.075 and support below at $0.065 and at $0.061.\n\nRead Next: Jack Dorsey's Block And Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy Are Both Big On Bitcoin — But Here's The Real Winner - MicroStrategy\n\n© 2023 Benzinga.com.

While other cryptos have been soaring in value of late, Ethereum has not. Currently trading at just under $1,800, Ethereum has repeatedly failed to surge past the $2,000 price mark this year and is now significantly underperforming Bitcoin (BTC 4.25%).\n\nAll of which makes Ethereum an intriguing investment right now. It\'s still the second-largest digital asset in the world (trailing only Bitcoin), and there are at least two good reasons Ethereum\'s price could start to move upward as we head into 2024.\n\nThe clear market leader\n\nFirst and foremost, Ethereum is still the 800-pound gorilla of the blockchain world. Ever since it pioneered the concept of smart contracts back in 2015, Ethereum has consistently been the first to market with just about every new blockchain innovation. And that has given Ethereum an enviable first-mover advantage in key areas such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nIn both areas, Ethereum is still the clear leader. For example, Ethereum is responsible for an eye-popping 54% of total value locked (TVL), arguably the single-best metric for measuring overall DeFi strength. No other blockchain even comes close.\n\nUntil rival blockchains, such as Solana or Avalanche, begin to chip away at Ethereum\'s market dominance at a faster pace, it\'s safe to say Ethereum will remain entrenched as the premier Layer 1 blockchain in the world. And that\'s exactly what I\'m looking for in a long-term investment prospect: a clear market leader with an established track record of excellence.\n\nContinuous cycle of improvement\n\nEthereum\'s success to date has not been an accident. Ethereum boasts the largest developer network in the world, and these developers are highly focused on maintaining Ethereum\'s market-leading position. Case in point: Last year, Ethereum pulled off The Merge, one of the most difficult and complex technical achievements ever in the blockchain world. Some compared its difficulty to that of changing the engine of an airplane while mid-flight.\n\nWhat makes Ethereum particularly enticing to long-term investors is that it has a very detailed roadmap for future development. Even after The Merge, Ethereum has plans for new technical changes to its blockchain to boost performance, lower fees, and improve overall scalability. The next major upgrade (known as Dencun) is now tentatively scheduled for the first quarter of 2024 and has already received plaudits from Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs.\n\nWhy has Ethereum fallen out of favor?\n\nSo the obvious question becomes, "If Ethereum is so great, why has it fallen out of favor with investors?" While there are several possible explanations, the most likely is that The Merge may have over-promised and under-delivered. There was so much buzz and speculation surrounding The Merge that it couldn\'t possibly live up to the hype.\n\nInvestors woke up the next day to find that nothing really seemed to have changed with the Ethereum blockchain. Transaction processing times were faster but only marginally so. Transaction fees were still high, and there were still pressing questions about the future of staking on the blockchain (something Ethereum fixed in April). On top of all that, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin himself acknowledged that a lot of work still had to be done. So, The Merge wasn\'t some kind of magic rocket fuel that was going to send Ethereum soaring. That lack of immediate sizzle certainly disappointed a lot of investors.\n\nAdd in that many of the blockchain sectors that initially generated a lot of buzz for Ethereum -- such as NFTs and the metaverse -- fell out of favor with users, developers, and investors in 2022. And don\'t forget, the unprecedented rise of ChatGPT out of seemingly nowhere late last year led to a tremendous swing in investor sentiment. Suddenly, generative artificial intelligence (AI) became the talk of the investment world, and Ethereum admittedly didn\'t have much to offer in this regard.\n\nInvest in Ethereum for the long haul?\n\nFrom my perspective, Ethereum remains a great long-term investment play. Right now, investor sentiment seems to be at a low point, but that could change soon. Buying Ethereum now, while it\'s still below $2,000, seems like a fantastic bargain. You\'re getting a proven market leader at a discount price, combined with a potential catalyst (the new Dencun tech upgrade) to start off the New Year with a bang.'}]

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
The news articles provide a mixed outlook for Ethereum (ETH) in the cryptocurrency market. On one hand, the seizure of $54 million worth of ETH linked to illegal activities may create negative sentiment and potential selling pressure. On the other hand, technical analysis suggests that ETH is holding key support levels and could potentially see a fresh surge towards $1,875 and beyond. Additionally, the long-term prospects for Ethereum remain positive due to its market leadership in blockchain innovations and continuous development efforts.

The “unified vision” of the companies involves “creating a fair and rewarding ecosystem for imaginative content contributors.”\n\nCreator royalties are non-negotiable\n\nMagic Eden and Yuga Labs have unequivocally announced that “respecting creator royalties is non-negotiable.” Therefore, Yuga Labs will exclusively work with marketplaces that pay royalties for all its future collections, according to the press release.\n\nBoth firms emphasized that the new Ethereum-based platform will be a testament to their long-term “commitment to protecting creator royalties.” The jointly launched platform will also aim to encourage innovation by boosting the number of builders and creators.\n\nDaniel Alegre, CEO of Yuga Labs, said:\n\n“Magic Eden is putting their money where their mouth is, and together we are supporting the building of an Ethereum marketplace that will back creators, without whom web3 would not exist.”\n\nLu added that the new marketplace will “reset” the royalty allocation standard and hopes that its principles will be adopted throughout the ecosystem.\n\nIn a post on X, Lu also noted that Magic Eden has already “managed to solve” the problem of royalties on Solana. The firm partnered with Metaplex, the protocol that enables NFT minting on Solana, to roll out royalty protection protocols.\n\n“Now, Royalties are the norm on SOL. And we believe we can do the same on Eth.”\n\nOpen taunt to OpenSea\n\nThe press release seemingly taunted OpenSea, one of the largest NFT marketplaces that made royalties optional in August. Highlighting their firm stance in favor of royalties, Yuga Labs and Magic Eden noted that they have “a clear stance amidst a sea of other marketplaces who turn their backs on creative entrepreneurs.”\n\nYuga Labs has publicly criticized OpenSea’s stance on royalties before. In August, Yuga Labs said it would shortly end support for Seaport, OpenSea’s marketplace contract, indicating that its NFTs will not be available on the marketplace in the future.'}, {'id': 4, 'time': 'Sat, 04 Nov 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Bitcoin and Ethereum price rise halting makes way for layer-2 & DeFi tokens to chart over 40% gains - FXStreet', 'content': 'Share:\n\nEthereum price, along with Bitcoin, is presently moving sideways after hitting $1,857 and $35,000 respectively.\n\nSmall-cap cryptocurrencies are making gains fuelled by high investor participation.\n\nThe total value of all other cryptocurrencies, excluding BTC and ETH, has risen by 14% but needs another 9.3% increase to recover all the recent losses.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum price initiated the bullish momentum that pulled up the entire cryptocurrency market. However, even as their rally comes to a halt, the rest of the altcoins seem to continue making the most of the situation, resulting in a significant rise over the past couple of days.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum price halt\n\nBitcoin, after hitting $35,000, stepped back for a while, and Ethereum price did the same after reaching $1,857. Both the cryptocurrencies for the past few days have been moving sideways as the market cools down, but there is an inkling that this sideways price action could result in a decline.\n\nIn the case of Ethereum, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator contributes to this forecast as the receding green bars on the histogram suggest the bullishness is waning. If this is followed by the signal line (orange) moving over the MACD line (blue), a bearish crossover would be confirmed.\n\nThis would occur only if Ethereum price loses the support of $1,827, which coincides with the crucial 61.8% Fibonacci Retracement from $2,005 to $1,539. The ensuing bearish momentum would not only confirm a bearish crossover but also bring ETH down to 50% Fibonacci line at $1,772.\n\nETH/USD 1-day chart\n\nHowever, if the sideways momentum meets bullish momentum via broader market cues and the $1,827 line is tested as a support floor, a recovery is on the cards. Breaching the 78.6% Fib retracement at $1,906 would not only invalidate the bearish thesis but also flip $1,900 into support.\n\nOther cryptocurrencies are faring rather well\n\nWhile BTC and ETH are seeing waning bullishness, the past few days have been spectacular for altcoin investors. Many layer-2 cryptocurrencies, as well as Decentralized Finance (DeFi) tokens, have seen significant rises along with the majority of the layer-1 tokens.\n\nAnalytics platform IntoTheBlock, in regards to this shift in capital, stated,\n\n"This week\'s trend suggests this rotation is beginning to take place as Bitcoin and Ether trend sideways while DeFi and alternative L1 tokens record a strong rebound.\n\nThis was verified by the fact that SushiSwap noted a 63% rise in the past three days. Other top DeFi tokens like THORChain (RUNE), PancakeSwap (CAKE), and Aave (AAVE) noted about 35%, 31%, and 15%, respectively.\n\nThis resulted in the market capitalization of altcoins, excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum, observing a 14.67% growth, adding 47.13 billion since mid-October. This has brought the market cap to $368 billion, but for the recent losses to be recovered, altcoins would need to collectively raise the market capitalization by 9.38% and register inflows worth $34.55 billion to bring it to a 2023 high of $402.5 billion.\n\nAltcoin market capitalization\n\nHistorically, crypto cycles have followed a pattern of Bitcoin leading the first surge, followed by Ethereum rising, and eventually, capital progressively being allocated to lower-cap and riskier bets. However, if the broader market cues turn bearish, these altcoins could also note sideways movement.\n\nRead more - SushiSwap price rallying by 63% in four days causes $4.8 million worth of short liquidations'}]

"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the market trend for ETH is currently bearish, with key indicators such as the MACD signal consistently indicating a sell trend. The data shows a decrease in open price, fluctuating unique addresses, and varying total value transferred, all pointing towards a downward trend.

On the other hand, the news analyst report suggests a potential positive market trend for ETH, with Ethereum's mainnet regaining dominance over Layer 2 networks and the launch of new projects like $CHIMPZ on the blockchain. However, it is important to note that short-term news reports may not always accurately reflect the long-term market trend.

In reflection of the reports, it is evident that prioritizing on-chain analysis over short-term news reports has been more effective in maximizing profit and managing risks successfully. Long-term strategies based on on-chain data have led to better outcomes in trading decisions. Therefore, a slightly conservative trading approach is recommended to align with long-term growth potential and effectively manage risks in the current cryptocurrency market.

Considering the synthesized reports and the emphasis on long-term strategies, I would take a cautious approach and decide to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.7. This decision is based on the bearish trend indicated by the on-chain data and the recommendation for a conservative trading approach to manage risks appropriately in the current market conditions.

Nerayoff claims that their fraudulent activities by far exceed the criminal scheme of former Boy Wonder Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nSteven Nerayoff Accuses Ether Founders Of Massive Fraud\n\nSteven Nerayoff has boldly alleged that Ethereum founders Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Lubin are bigger fraudsters than the now-convicted Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nNerayoff made this wild allegation regarding Buterin and Lubin in a recent post on X (formerly known as Twitter). According to the ex-Ethereum advisor, the pair committed more fraudulent activities regarding the ETH coin than Bankman-Fried.\n\n“Ethereum is the fraudulent elephant in the room in plain sight 1000x bigger than SBF,” Nerayoff opined.\n\nBankman-Fried orchestrated one of the biggest financial frauds in American history, involving his crypto exchange FTX and its sister trading firm Alameda Research. SBF’s scheme to pilfer funds from FTX customers and lenders to purchase luxury property, Binance’s stake in FTX, and political favor unraveled, taking the 31-year-old MIT graduate down with it. He was recently convicted on all seven counts and faces up to 110 years in prison.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo Ethereum Founders Have Ties To Corrupt SEC Officials?\n\nNerayoff did not offer any substantial evidence to back up his explosive allegations against Ethereum’s Buterin and Lubin, but he cited key figures in the U.S. government such as ex-SEC chair Jay Clayton and current chair Gary Gensler, who reportedly had private dealings with the duo.\n\n“Joe Lubin & Vitalik Buterin have been the front with corrupt officials at the highest levels of federal agencies such as Clayton, Gensler & many others. Cover this now,” Nerayoff asserted.\n\nNerayoff’s claims imply that Ethereum’s executives likely bribed high-ranking government officials, giving the project an unfair advantage in the cryptocurrency market. The bribery claim is that Ethereum execs gave the U.S. Securities and Exchange hush money to turn a blind eye to the network’s ICO and thus not lodge securities violation charges.\n\nAll in all, the credibility of Nerayoff’s allegations isn’t helped by his own reputation for often stretching the truth: He has labeled himself as one of the eight Ethereum co-creators in the past, which has been dismissed as baloney by other early Ethereum contributors.'}, {'id': 5, 'time': 'Sun, 05 Nov 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Ethereum (ETH) Network Hits New 6-Month High, Here's How - U.Today", 'content': 'Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThe Ethereum network has witnessed a significant surge in transaction volumes, hitting a new six-month high. Over the last week, the mainnet alone settled over $213 billion in transactions, underscoring a robust uptick in on-chain activity. Layer 2 solutions such as Arbitrum, Optimism and Base have further buoyed this growth, adding another $16 billion to the aggregate volume. This uptrend reflects growing confidence and utility in the Ethereum ecosystem, suggesting an increasingly vibrant blockchain landscape.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe spike in transaction volume has come with other noteworthy metrics, such as an increase in transaction fees. While higher fees can indicate network congestion and increased demand for block space, they also reflect the economic activity on the network. Investors and users should monitor these fees as they can affect the cost-effectiveness of conducting transactions on the Ethereum network.\n\nOver the past week, the network burned an average of 855,000 ETH per year, a mechanism that could contribute to deflationary pressure on the token\'s supply over time. This "burn" counteracts the issuance of new ETH, aiming to create a balance that can benefit the asset\'s long-term valuation.\n\nLooking at the daily chart, Ethereum\'s price action appears bullish. The price is maintaining a consistent pattern above both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, indicating sustained buyer interest. The chart showcases a series of higher lows and higher highs — a classical uptrend signal. The recent price has surpassed local resistance levels, potentially aiming for higher price points.\n\nThe increase in on-chain activity, coupled with the reduction in supply due to the burn mechanism, are both fundamental factors that could be driving optimism in the market. The Layer 2 scaling solutions are also contributing to increased accessibility and efficiency, potentially drawing more users and transactions to the network.'}, {'id': 10, 'time': 'Sun, 05 Nov 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Crypto Strategist Predicts Rallies for Ethereum and Three ETH-Based Altcoins – Here Are His Targets - The Daily Hodl', 'content': "A widely followed crypto analyst believes that Ethereum (ETH) and three other altcoins in its ecosystem are primed for surges.\n\nPseudonymous analyst Kaleo tells his 601,300 followers on the social media platform X that Ethereum is threatening to take out its diagonal resistance at $1,900.\n\nAccording to a chart shared by the analyst, Ethereum may rally to as high as $2,100 following a breakout.\n\n“Considering it is a diagonal season, the fun for ETH should really start whenever it clears $1,900.”\n\nAt time of writing, Ethereum is trading for $1,854.\n\nThe crypto strategist is also keeping an eye on the Ethereum scaling solution Arbitrum (ARB).

On the other hand, Vermont, New York, Oregon, and the District of Columbia are the only areas where Ethereum has surpassed Ripple’s coin.\n\nXRP’s price has gone through numerous ups and downs since the beginning of 2023, experiencing a significant uptrend in the second half of the year. The positive performance could be a result of the developments surrounding the lawsuit between Ripple and the US SEC, specifically the three partial wins that the blockchain enterprise has secured so far.\n\nThe outcome of the legal battle, which has been ongoing since December 2020, is expected to be revealed in the spring of 2024 during a grand trial.

The news articles present a mix of positive and negative sentiments surrounding Ethereum (ETH). On one hand, the Ethereum network has experienced a surge in transaction volumes, leading to increased on-chain activity and a reduction in supply due to the burn mechanism, which could drive optimism in the market. Additionally, analysts predict rallies for Ethereum and its related altcoins, suggesting potential price increases in the short term. However, allegations of fraud against Ethereum's co-founders by a former advisor may create uncertainty and negative sentiment in the market.

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that there are several bearish indicators for ETH, including a consistent decrease in key metrics and a sell trend indicated by the MACD signal. The news analyst report presents a mixed sentiment towards Ethereum, with both bullish and bearish factors influencing its price movement. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of prioritizing on-chain analysis for maximizing profit and managing risks effectively.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is evident that the bearish indicators from the on-chain analysis outweigh the mixed sentiment from the news reports. Long-term strategies based on on-chain data have proven to be more effective in making trading decisions. Therefore, it is advisable to adopt a slightly conservative trading approach and prioritize on-chain analysis over short-term news reports.

Based on the overall market trend and the emphasis on long-term strategies, I would take a cautious approach and sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.7.

Considering the current market conditions and the mixed outlook from the reports, I would take a slightly conservative trading action with a confidence level of 0.3.

[{'id': 11, 'time': 'Mon, 06 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Did Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Short Ethereum? Unraveling A 70,000 ETH Sale - NewsBTC', 'content': 'A video has surfaced on social media where Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin revealed he sold 70,000 ETH tokens during its price all-time high.\n\nButerin Acknowledges Shorting Ethereum\n\nCrypto community member, MetaMan X, published a video post on X (formerly Twitter), disclosing a conversation where Ethereum Founder, Vitalik Buterin admitted that he had sold about 70,000 ETH tokens, essentially shorting the cryptocurrency during a major all-time high.\n\nIn the podcast with American hedge fund director, Eric Ross Weinstein, Buterin spoke on the price of Ethereum and Bitcoin in 2017. During Ethereum’s previous all-time high in 2017, when the price of ETH rose as high as $1,600 and Bitcoin’s price was up $20,000, Buterin voiced doubts about whether the significant price surge truly aligned with the crypto market’s modest achievements over the years.\n\n“The crypto space has reached half a trillion dollars, does it deserve it?” Buterin stated.\n\nWhen asked if he had shorted Ethereum during the all-time high, Buterin stated that he had convinced the Ethereum Foundation to sell a considerable amount of ETH tokens, and the result of the decision made a huge impact on the cryptocurrency later.\n\n“I did get the Ethereum Foundation to sell 70,000 ETH like basically at the top, and that’s doubled our runway now, so it was one good decision that had a lot of impact,” Buterin said.\n\nETH price at $1,886 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nCommunity Worries Over Buterin’s ETH Sell-Offs\n\nMany crypto community members have raised concerns about the multiple ETH transactions said to be conducted by Ethereum’s founder. Recently, Buterin was spotted making a transfer of 100 ETH, worth about $181,000 to Coinbase, one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges.\n\nThe motive behind the transaction has sparked curiosity among Ethereum investors and the crypto community. Earlier in August, Buterin was also reported moving 600 ETH worth $1 million to Coinbase.\n\nHowever, the Ethereum Founder had publicly clarified in October that he had not sold any ETH tokens for personal gain since 2018. He also stated that most ETH transactions were not him selling, but rather the recipients of his charitable donations selling the ETH tokens.\n\nThe founder has also been caught in controversy over the weekend when Ethereum whistleblower Steven Nerayoff alleged that Buterin was involved in some sort of fraud involving ETH.\n\nNerayoff says Ethereum is linked to corrupt SEC officials to carry out this fraud which he says is on a larger scale than what happened with FTX. For reference, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried has been found guilty of fraud charges after the exchange filed for bankruptcy in 2022 with a $9 billion hold in its balance sheet.\n\nFeatured image from Crypto News, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Economic news last week gave investors reason to move further out on the risk curve, and that meant in part bidding up the value of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThree of the biggest movers were Ethereum (ETH 2.02%), Dogecoin (DOGE 0.50%), and Shiba Inu (SHIB 2.63%). Ethereum rose as much as 5.4% between Friday's close and noon ET on Monday and is now up 4.8% over that time. Dogecoin had a more pronounced move, climbing 10.2% and currently trading 9.1% higher. Shiba Inu is at its high point, up 7.1%.\n\nEconomic data driving markets\n\nThe economic news last week helped push markets, including cryptocurrencies, higher to end the week. Investors saw the Federal Reserve's decision to pause rate hikes as a positive and there was a lot of speculation that rates would be kept flat through the end of the year.\n\nOn top of that, a weaker-than-expected jobs report was seen as a positive for markets. As the thinking goes, if job growth is slowing, the economy may not be overheating -- which means the Federal Reserve will stop raising rates to slow the economy.\n\nIt may seem counterintuitive, but lower interest rates are currently seen as very bullish for riskier assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies. And short term, that's driving values higher.\n\nETF speculation continues\n\nTrading momentum continues to be strong on speculation that more crypto ETFs will be approved. We know the SEC is considering multiple Bitcoin ETFs, and that could pave the way for both more crypto ETFs and more funds flowing into the industry more broadly.\n\nBlackRock is one of the leading institutions applying for a spot ETF. The company controls $9 trillion in assets under management, so it could lead to a big inflow of funds to the crypto industry. That's the speculation.\n\nMany institutions have shied away from crypto because of the legal grey area it operates in, especially in the U.S. So, approval by the SEC would be generally bullish for crypto broadly at a time when many countries are writing specific rules on how cryptocurrencies can be traded and how blockchain companies can operate.\n\nWhile the market is speculating that a Bitcoin ETF would eventually be bullish for tokens like Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu, it's not clear if they would eventually get spot ETFs as well.\n\nSpeculation rules the day\n\nThe reality is that everything I discussed above is speculation about the value of cryptocurrencies. There's no increased utility or ability to pay for goods using the blockchain. Investors are simply bidding up digital assets because of what the Federal Reserve did and what they think the SEC might do.\n\nIf any of this speculation ends up being false, it's possible that crypto values could crash again. I would like to see more real world utility being built into the blockchain and tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu find real use cases. Until they do, this is just a speculative asset.\n\nEthereum still has the potential to be a valuable blockchain, but it also struggles with high costs and slow transactions. Upgrades could change that, but that will take time. Investors seem to be glossing over that utility need today."}, {'id': 14, 'time': 'Mon, 06 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Bing Ventures Presents Ethereum 2030, Devconnect's Premier Event - Yahoo Finance", 'content': 'Singapore --News Direct-- Bing Ventures Limited\n\nBing Ventures, a Singapore-based pioneering venture capital firm backing early projects in Web3 and Blockchain, is joining hands with leading crypto exchange BingX to present Ethereum 2030: Unraveling Tomorrow’s Innovations, a premier event during Devconnect 2023 on Wednesday, November 15, 2023, at 2:00 pm GMT+3 in Istanbul.\n\nEthereum 2030 will bring together industry heavyweights, visionaries, and trendsetters for a half-day of engaging keynote speeches, in-depth panel discussions, valuable networking opportunities, and audience engagement – all focused on inspiring and nurturing entrepreneurs for a new era of innovation.\n\nThe event will be held at Sofitel Istanbul Taksim, which sits in the heart of the city, with unique views of Taksim Square and the mesmerizing Bosphorus and has the capacity to welcome up to 1,000 attendees.\n\nThe agenda covers various topics, including decentralized finance, Ethereum scalability, Web3 security, and the crypto landscape in Turkey.\n\nEthereum 2030, a Devconnect 2023 event\n\nFeatured speakers include:\n\nYajin (Andy) Zhou, CEO of Blocksec\n\nAzeem Khan, Head of Impact at Gitcoin\n\nJack He, Co-founder at Aspecta\n\nBertuğ Oymak, Co-Founder and CEO of Utilify\n\nDougie DeLuca, Investor at Figment Capital\n\nFatih Taşdemir, Co-Founder of Koin Bülteni\n\nVolkan KORKMAZ, CEO and Co-Founder at Altcointurk\n\nLuca (Moss) Mossini, BD at Avantgarde & Enzyme Finance\n\nSeraphim Czecker, Head of Taking Risk\n\nVaruni Trivedi, Editor in Chief at Voice of Crypto\n\nAnıl Öz, Chief Technology Officer at DATS Project\n\nArif Kalem, Brand Ambassador of Turkey at BingX\n\nÖzge ERDEMİR, Web3 Advisor, Business Developer\n\nSima Baktas, Web3 Attorney at GlobalB Law / Co-Founder of CryptoFemale\n\nDaria Krasnova, Managing Editor at BeInCrypto\n\nWayne Wu, Partner of Bing Ventures highlighted the purpose of the conference, saying:\n\n“As the largest and most established decentralized programmable blockchain in the world, Ethereum has been at the forefront of ground-breaking trends.

Despite the current bullish trend, Ether’s 17% return over the last 30 days falls short of Bitcoin’s (BTC) impressive 27% gain during the same period.\n\nRegulatory hurdles and ecosystem centralization critiques linger\n\nAnalysts attribute some of Ether’s underperformance to uncertainty surrounding Consensys, a key player in the Ethereum ecosystem. Former employees have filed a lawsuit against the company and its co-founder Joseph Lubin. Over two dozen shareholders of the Swiss holding company, Consensys AG, claim that Lubin, who is also a co-founder of Ethereum, violated a “no-dilution promise” made in 2015.\n\nConsensys is responsible for developing and hosting infrastructure projects crucial to the Ethereum network. It was founded in October 2014, about nine months before the Ethereum blockchain launched in mid-2015. Furthermore, the High Court of Zug in Switzerland ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, exacerbating the current uncertainty.\n\nRegulatory challenges have hampered the growth of the Ethereum ecosystem. The latest concern centers around PayPal’s U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, PYUSD, which operates on the Ethereum network. This token is designed for digital payments and Web3 applications. On Nov. 2, PayPal disclosed a subpoena it received from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nIn addition to regulatory pressures, there has been notable criticism of the decentralization of financial applications within the Ethereum network. Chainlink, a preferred solution for oracle services, quietly reduced the number of participants in its multisignature wallet from four out of nine to four out of eight. Analysts have highlighted the lack of governance by regular users as a significant issue.\n\nEther’s underperformance to altcoins is evidence of other issues\n\nSeveral major altcoins — including Solana’s SOL (SOL), XRP (XRP) and Cardano’s ADA (ADA) — have outperformed Ether, with returns of 75.5%, 37% and 35% in the last 30 days, respectively. This discrepancy suggests that the factors holding back ETH are not solely related to regulatory pressure or reduced demand for the decentralized finance and nonfungible token markets.\n\nOne pressing issue for the Ethereum network is the high gas fees associated with transactions, including those executed by smart contracts. The latest seven-day average transaction fee was $4.90, negatively impacting the usage of decentralized applications (DApps).\n\nMoreover, the total deposits on the Ethereum network, measured in Ether, have dropped to their lowest levels since August 2020. It’s essential to note that this analysis does not consider the effects of native Ethereum staking.\n\nEthereum network applications' total deposits in ETH. Source: DefiLlama\n\nAccording to DefiLlama data, Ethereum DApps had a total value locked (TVL) of 12.7 million ETH on Nov. 5, down 4% from the 13.2 million ETH two months earlier. In comparison, the TVL on the Tron network increased by 13% during the same period, while Arbitrum deposits remained at 1 million ETH. Data on DApp activity on the Ethereum network supports the notion of reduced activity.\n\nEthereum network top DApps, 30-day active addresses. Source: DappRadar\n\nEven excluding the significant 60% decline in the Uniswap NFT Aggregator, the average number of active addresses across the top Ethereum network DApps decreased by 3% compared with the previous month. In contrast, Solana’s top applications saw an average 18% increase in active users during the same period, according to DappRadar data.\n\nRelated: Aave pauses several markets after reports of feature issue\n\nFinally, on-chain activity indicates increased user deposits of ETH at exchanges. While this data doesn’t necessarily signal short-term selling, the mere availability of coins is typically viewed as a precautionary measure by analysts.\n\nAverage 7-day daily ETH deposits at exchanges, ETH thousands. Source: Coin Metrics\n\nThe present daily ETH deposit average of 255,614 represents a 30% increase from two weeks earlier, indicating that holders are more inclined to sell as Ether’s price approaches $1,900.\n\nThe data suggests that reduced TVL, declining DApps activity and a higher rate of ETH exchange deposits are negatively impacting the likelihood of Ether breaking the $1,900 resistance. The price level could be more challenging than initially expected, and for now, Ether bears can take a breath.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

The investigator highlighted the deep involvement of entities affiliated to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in Ethereum’s genesis, mining network, and protocol development.\n\nWith Ethereum having transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus model, the spotlight is back on the token distribution. The investigator argues that the outsized control of tokens by Chinese entities poses a severe threat to Ethereum’s decentralization credentials. Let’s analyze the cybersleuth’s claims to understand the implications for Ethereum.\n\nEthereum’s China Links\n\nTruthLabs points out that Chinese conglomerate Wanxiang group was an early backer of Ethereum. The group purchased $500,000 worth of ETH from Vitalik Buterin in 2015 and helped him set up the network’s original wallets.\n\nThat donation was later converted to 416,000 ETH tokens. Since then, there has never been any explanation of what Wanxiang received in return for this generous support.\n\nEthereum's hidden Centralization problem: The Chinese Communist Party. The same party using blockchain to track and control everything, Implementing Social Credit Scores, CBDC's, and a number of other surveillance protocols. The CCP, thru Wanxiang, and a number of other CCP… https://t.co/uYxIqUY6n5 — TruthLabs 🫡 (@BoringSleuth) November 5, 2023\n\n“Vitalik was out of cash, and he found it by selling ETH’s decentralized future to the CCP,” said TruthLabs.\n\nWanxiang Group was founded in 1969 by Lu Guanqiu as an agricultural machinery company in China. It has grown into one of China’s largest non-state-owned companies with over $30 billion in revenue.\n\nWanxiang Raising Concerns\n\nWanxiang entered the US market in 1994 and now has over 5,000 employees across the country. More recently, Wanxiang has shown strong interest in blockchain and crypto, establishing Wanxiang Blockchain Labs in 2017.\n\nIts deep ties with the CCP raise concerns that the Chinese government may be covertly running Ethereum nodes despite the network’s pseudonymous structure. Beyond holding large chunks of ETH, Chinese mining entities are also allegedly controlling over 80% of Ethereum’s mining power.\n\nA complete guess, 66.6%. I found 12 Genesis Block Wallets today, alone where they ended up with the majority of the ETH from. Its so hard to know. They were invested in over 500 projects by EOY 2021, and in many cases got the pre-ICO tokens prior to both ETH/altcoin price waves. — TruthLabs 🫡 (@BoringSleuth) June 28, 2023\n\nWhile the shift to proof-of-stake limits the influence miners can exert, critics argue that the excessive ETH hoarded by Chinese players still poses a threat. According to TruthLabs, entities linked to the CCP may hold up to 66% of all ETH in circulation. Although, the account has qualified that statement by saying it is a “complete guess.”\n\nIf true, this enormous, opaque concentration of ETH in wallets associated with the Chinese regime increases the risk of a centralized attack on the network. It also undermines Ethereum’s credibility as a decentralized ecosystem.\n\nAs TruthLabs has pointed out on multiple occasions, Ethereum’s China links are not breaking news. On top of early Chinese investment, Buterin also appeared preoccupied with learning Chinese as early as January 2014, according to Laura Shin’s book The Cryptopians—the period shortly before Chinese backers came on board.\n\nFurthermore, Buterin became the chief scientist of Wanxiang Blockchain Labs, a subsidiary, in the latter half of 2015. A 2016 Facebook post identified Buterin as a co-founder of WBL, alongside Xiao and Bo Shen, co-founders of the Bitshares decentralized exchange.\n\nTransparency Needed To Avoid Centralization Risks\n\nEthereum has firmly established itself as the leading smart contract platform, with an impressive array of DeFi and NFT projects built on it. However, for understandable reasons, lingering doubts remain around just how decentralized its network really is.\n\nThe concentration of nodes is an issue, as Buterin himself acknowledges. Transparency around the top ETH wallets is even more critical in light of the transition to proof-of-stake. A few unknown whales potentially hold enough ETH to sway votes or even attack the network.\n\nA quick 🧵showing that Wanxiang, Chinese auto and early Ethereum Investor funded and setup Vitalik Buterins official wallets. 1/6https://t.co/4uMLLnzguq pic.twitter.com/Ec1cjLOLz2 — TruthLabs 🫡 (@BoringSleuth) January 29, 2023\n\nWhile Ethereum downplays its ties to China today, evidence shows deep involvement of Chinese entities, including state-linked ones, during its early days.\n\nHowever, greater transparency on who the major ETH holder..."}]

DAILY RETURN:
0.013273566878349907
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing a downward trend with bearish sentiment. The decrease in total value transferred, fluctuating gas prices, and the overall decrease in market activity indicate a potential for further decline in the near future. 

On the other hand, the news analyst report presents a more positive outlook for Ethereum, highlighting increased on-chain activity, potential price rallies, and optimism in the market. However, the fraud allegations against Ethereum's co-founders could introduce volatility and caution among investors.

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that prioritizing on-chain analysis has been a successful strategy in making profitable trading decisions. Long-term growth potential in Ethereum has also been beneficial in generating positive returns on investments. Therefore, a slightly conservative trading approach may be warranted to manage risks effectively while capitalizing on long-term growth opportunities.

Considering the synthesized reports, the market trend for Ethereum appears to be more positive in the long term despite short-term uncertainties. Therefore, I would take a slightly conservative approach and assign a trading action of 0.5, reflecting moderate confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.

Speculation arose around a “flippening” and institutional investors waited in the wings.\n\nBut ether’s price did not end up meeting these expectations. NFTs tested new lows, and the bear market muted DeFi engagement. Bitcoin continued to outpace ether in 2023 — recently reaching dominance levels not seen since 2021. Meanwhile, institutional inflows are largely yet to materialize.\n\nBlockworks spoke with Justin Drake, a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, about the network’s current standing and future prospects. Keep reading for more excerpts from Blockworks’ interview with Drake.\n\nBlockworks: You can see variations of this stat in different places, but the rewards paid out by Ethereum were larger than the transaction fees that were burned in both September and October. It looks like that’s turned around a little bit, but how should people think about issuance versus burn and when that flips negative?\n\nDrake: The fee market is exceptionally volatile. What you really want to be doing is zooming out, because when you zoom out, you’re smoothing your data over a longer period of time.\n\nIf you look at ultrasound.money, you’ll notice that when it’s profitable, it’s like printing money. It’s really, really profitable. Ethereum has about a profit margin of 50% which is outstanding for a business. Now okay, on some days, especially weekends, it won’t be profitable. In some months, if you’re in the absolute depth of the bear market, then it won’t be profitable. But over a long period of time, it’s extremely profitable.\n\nBlockworks: How important is this deflationary aspect of Ethereum and Ethereum’s ability to generate fees? Because obviously Ethereum is not a company in the traditional sense where your revenues need to outweigh costs. So how should people think about revenue versus issuance? And how important is that metric as a way to gauge the success of the network?\n\nDrake: Broader than just as a company, some people think of ether, the asset, as money for the internet. And in that context, scarcity as a meme is extremely important. There’s this almost obsession with the 21 million Bitcoin meme precisely because it’s all about scarcity. And for the first time in history pretty much, we have money which not only has a fixed supply but actually has a decreasing supply.\n\nSo now there’s what I call memetic potential. Memes are ideas that spread. The 21 million meme is one that spreads far and wide because it’s kind of an attractive thing intellectually. There’s an opportunity potentially for this meme to spread that ether is the scarcest money on Earth. Its supply is going down over time.\n\nBlockworks: And who benefits from this meme?\n\nDrake: Ether the asset is the basis of two very fundamental public goods in any programmable blockchain.\n\nPublic good number one is economic security. We’re trying to build systems here which have a lot of longevity. We want to be in a position where it’s extremely difficult even for the most powerful nation-states out there to attack Ethereum.\n\nAnd then there’s this second really important public good for blockchains which is called economic bandwidth, and that’s the ability to be used as collateral within DeFi. Ether is especially valuable as collateral money because it’s the only so-called pristine collateral. Pristine means that there’s no contract risk. There’s no governance risk. There’s no oracle risk. It’s the one risk free asset.\n\nBlockworks: It sounds like you’re saying the idea of ultrasound money is a means to these larger ends that you described.\n\nDrake: Exactly. It’s a Trojan Horse, but ultimately the value is utilitarian through economic security and economic bandwidth.\n\nBlockworks: Ethereum’s validator queue has been in the hundreds of people waiting to stake ether (ETH), and that’s down from tens of thousands over the summer and even into September. What do you make of this?\n\nDrake: The churn, which is basically the amount of validators that can be processed by the queue, is proportional to the amount of staked ETH. As the amount of staked ETH grows, the churn grows and it becomes easier and easier to clear the queue. And so in that sense, looking at the queue is kind of a totally irrelevant game. The fact that the queue is very low just means that ether is very efficient at processing deposits.\n\nThe better metric is what’s called deposits. Every single day on average, there’s 40,000 ETH coming in, which is a huge amount of money.\n\nBlockworks: How concerned are you about staking yields being down?\n\nDrake: I mean in a way, the lower the better, right? Because it means that we’re not spending as much to secure Ethereum. Ethereum is already extremely secure.\n\nThe security ratio is the value secured by Ethereum, which is all the ETH, all the NFTs, all the ERC-20s divided by the value securing Ethereum, and it’s 7.5, which is extremely healthy....'}]

Overall, the market trend for Ethereum may be influenced by regulatory decisions, institutional interest, and network developments, with a potential for price volatility in the short term.

*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
After reviewing the on-chain, news, and reflection analyst reports, it is evident that the current market trend for ETH is bearish in the short term due to the downward trend indicated by the sell signals in the MACD analysis, challenges in price performance, and potential regulatory impacts. However, there are positive long-term growth prospects highlighted in terms of Ethereum's deflationary aspect, successful transition to proof-of-stake, and potential as a valuable asset in the long term.

Considering the uncertainties in the short term and the importance of long-term growth potential, it is advisable to adopt a slightly conservative trading approach to navigate market uncertainties and potential price declines while focusing on long-term growth prospects. Prioritizing on-chain analysis for making profitable trading decisions, managing risks effectively, and capitalizing on growth opportunities is crucial in the volatile cryptocurrency market.

Therefore, I would take a slightly conservative approach and assign a trading action of 0.3, reflecting moderate confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately while keeping an eye on long-term growth prospects in ETH trading.

Everything from decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to enterprise blockchain solutions relies on Ethereum's technology. Ethereum's native token, Ether, is the second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin (BTC 5.7%). The Ethereum Merge, the network's long-awaited shift to a proof-of-stake system, is expected to make the technology remarkably more energy-efficient. The Ethereum Foundation has predicted the shift will cut energy usage by around 99.95%. If you want to profit from the growing use of Ethereum, there are several ways you can invest. The most direct option is buying Ethereum itself. Because it's extremely volatile, this carries the greatest risk but also the greatest potential profits. Another option is buying Ethereum stocks, including managed funds that invest in Ethereum for you and companies with large exposure to Ethereum technology.\n\nWhat is Ethereum? Ethereum is an open-source blockchain technology in the form of software. Software developer Vitalik Buterin originally proposed the idea in 2013, and Ethereum launched in 2015. Any developer making an application that would benefit from blockchain technology can build it on the Ethereum network. While Ethereum is most associated with its native Ether token and other cryptocurrencies, its technology is also enabling widespread innovation in industries as diverse as insurance, logistics, and healthcare. Developers write programs on Ethereum using self-executing, self-enforcing protocols called smart contracts, which are deployed to Ethereum-powered blockchains. The blockchain's network of computers executes the smart contract by performing specified actions when the conditions of the contract are met. Blockchain data can't be modified after it's created, and that gives users confidence in the technology. Although early cryptocurrencies, most notably Bitcoin, are merely stores of value that can be transferred, Ethereum has more uses. If Bitcoin is a smartphone app, Ethereum is more like the device maker. Ethereum's cryptocurrency benefits from its technology because transaction fees for decentralized applications on its blockchain are paid in Ether. What is the Ethereum Merge? The Ethereum Merge is the term for the network's switch from its original proof-of-work system to a proof-of-stake system, scheduled to occur in mid-September 2022. When Ethereum launched, it used proof of work, the same system used by Bitcoin, to validate and record transactions. A notable drawback of this system is extremely high energy usage, which has led to Bitcoin using more power per year than some entire countries. In 2020, Ethereum introduced the Beacon Chain, a proof-of-stake network. However, it continued using its original proof-of-work mainnet for processing transactions. The Merge is when Ethereum will combine the Beacon Chain with the mainnet and make the transition to proof of stake. The primary benefit of The Merge is energy efficiency. Transaction speeds will change a small amount but not enough for most users to notice.\n\nTop Ethereum stocks Here are the best stocks to buy if you want to add Ethereum to your portfolio: 1. Grayscale Ethereum Trust The Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE 2.67%) is a managed fund that makes it easy to add Ethereum to your brokerage account. Each share is backed by a fixed amount of Ether tokens (approximately 0.01 Ether per share). Keep in mind that the fund's share price is often lower than the value of Ethereum at the prevailing conversion rate. Grayscale also charges a somewhat expensive annual management fee of 2.5%. Shareholders can't exchange shares for Ethereum, so there's no price arbitrage opportunity. 2. Bitwise Ethereum Fund Bitwise is the world's biggest crypto index fund manager. It offers managed funds for multiple types of cryptocurrency, and one option is the Bitwise Ethereum Fund. The fund is available to accredited investors and has a minimum investment of $25,000. The fund's managers seek to minimize transaction costs, and they hold the fund's Ethereum offline in cold crypto storage, making it a cost-efficient and secure Ethereum stock. There's an annual management fee of 1.5%. If you want a more diverse digital asset portfolio, check out the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund (BITW 4.43%), which includes a mix of several of the top cryptocurrencies. 3. Coinbase Coinbase (COIN 2.72%) is the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S. The company charges transaction fees to buyers and sellers of a wide range of cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum. In addition to Ethereum, many other cryptocurrencies traded on Coinbase use the Ethereum blockchain. The exchange rolled out Ethereum staking in 2021, allowing investors to lock up their Ether and earn rewards on it during the upgrade to a proof-of-stake system. Coinbase's staking program is expected to signifi..."}]

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing a bearish trend with potential for further decline. The fluctuating on-chain metrics and sell signal in the MACD indicator suggest a weakening market sentiment. 

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights a mix of positive and negative factors influencing the ETH market. While positive events like the Ethereum 2030 event have contributed to recent price increases, concerns over regulatory challenges and centralization issues pose risks to the long-term sustainability of Ethereum.

Reflecting on the recent trading performance, it is evident that prioritizing on-chain analysis has been a successful strategy in making profitable trading decisions. Long-term growth potential in Ethereum has been a key factor in generating positive returns on investments.

Considering the mixed outlook from the reports, a slightly conservative trading approach may be warranted to balance risk management with the potential for future gains in the market. It is important to focus on long-term strategies rather than short-term gains to navigate the current market uncertainties.

Based on the synthesized reports and the emphasis on long-term strategies, I would take a slightly bearish stance on the ETH market and opt for a trading action of -0.3 to reflect my cautious approach in managing risks and potential further decline in the market.

Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, was up 2.56% at $36,553, hovering around an 18-month high.\n\nEarlier this year, BlackRock registered a bitcoin trust in the same manner and a week later filed an application with the SEC to launch a spot bitcoin ETF. BlackRock declined to comment on the trust's creation or on any plans for an ETF filing.\n\nTo date, roughly a dozen ETF providers have filed to create spot bitcoin ETFs, or convert existing products into spot ETFs, helping fuel the recent rally in the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has so far not approved any other than ETFs tied to futures contracts, with SEC Chair Gary Gensler arguing that the spot bitcoin market is prone to fraud and manipulation.\n\nSeveral other ETF providers that have applied for spot bitcoin ETFs also have sought SEC approval for spot ether ETFs, including Ark Investment Management, Invesco and VanEck.

The token was trading at $2,095 on Friday afternoon.\n\nNasdaq filed a 19b-4 form with the SEC on Nov. 9 to launch the ETF. The fund would be called the iShares Ethereum Trust if approved. BlackRock registered the ETF's ethereum trust in Delaware earlier Thursday.\n\nWhile investors have been anticipating a potentially imminent spot bitcoin ETF approval, many see a spot ether fund as the next step after the SEC greenlights bitcoin, if it does.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission allows exchange-traded funds that track bitcoin and ether futures contracts, but has rejected applications for spot bitcoin ETFs on the grounds that the vehicles would be susceptible to market manipulation and fraud.\n\n“Given the SEC had approved both bitcoin- and ethereum futures-based ETFs, it makes sense that following any approval of a spot bitcoin ETF by the SEC, approval of a spot ethereum ETF would follow closely,” said Bradley Duke, chief strategy officer at ETC Group.\n\nWhen BlackRock first filed for a spot bitcoin ETF in June, the price of bitcoin rose. Because BlackRock is a long-established Wall Street player, the firm’s interest in cryptocurrency ETFs is a pathway to the asset class reaching a market of traditional finance investors if approved.\n\nEthereum ETFs\n\nFor digital-asset investors, ethereum has a unique set of use cases independent from bitcoin.\n\n“You could point to applications built on ethereum that have hundreds of thousands of users on a daily basis; that just resonates with financial advisors at a level,” said Matt Hougan, chief investment officer of Bitwise.\n\nYet ether futures-based ETFs have garnered far less enthusiasm from investors than bitcoin funds have. The ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH) has pulled in $7.7 million, according to etf.com data. The combined six ETFs that started trading on Oct. 2 garnered only $1.9 million on their first day of trading.\n\nStory continues\n\nA spot product, however, is what many investors have their eye one. As the SEC continues its talks with the firms that are filing for a spot bitcoin ETF, a consensus is building among people familiar with the matter that the SEC could give preliminary approval to multiple spot bitcoin ETFs by the end of this year.\n\nBitcoin was trading at $37,224 on Friday afternoon, up 2.3% in the past 24 hours.\n\nContact Lucy Brewster at lucy.brewster@etf.com.\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | © Copyright 2023 etf.com.

The crypto continued its climb north as hopes grow the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission will approve a spot Bitcoin ETF and more analysts become bullish on the likelihood the approval comes soon.\n\nEthereum (CRYPTO: ETH) heavily outpaced Bitcoin on Thursday, surging about 13% compared to Bitcoin’s 3.24% move north.

Click here for a free trial.\n\nThe Bitcoin and Ethereum Charts: Bitcoin and Ethereum were trading slightly higher and lower, respectively on Friday, with each forming an inside bar pattern on declining volume. The formation leaned bullish in both Bitcoin’s and Ethereum’s case because the inside bars were forming at the top of the mother bars and both cryptos are in uptrends.\n\nThe sideways consolidation was helping Bitcoin and Ethereum’s eight-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) to catch up to the cryptos’ prices. If the two apex cryptos continue to trade sideways over the weekend, it would also help to lower their relative strength index (RSI), as both Bitcoin and Ethereum were in overbought territory.\n\nWhile a golden cross formed on Bitcoin’s chart on Oct. 29, the 50-day SMA was trending below the 200-day SMA on Ethereum’s chart. If Ethereum continued to trend above the 200-day, the 50-day would eventually cross above the 200-day, which would cause a golden cross to form and give bullish traders more confidence going forward.\n\nBitcoin has resistance above at $38,105 and at $39,600 and support below at $35,593 and at $31,862.\n\nEthereum has resistance above at $2,150 and at $2,317 and support below at $2,020 and at $1,937.\n\nThe Dogecoin Chart: Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, which surged Thursday, Dogecoin was highly volatile, losing 8% and climbing over 3% at one point before settling to close the session slightly lower.\n\nDogecoin has been trading mostly sideways between about 7 cents and $0.075 since Sunday, which helped drop the crypto’s RSI down to the 64% mark.\n\nDogecoin’s horizontal consolidation has taken place above the 200-day SMA, which was a likely scenario after a stock or crypto regained that level. Like Ethereum, if Dogecoin continued to trade above the 200-day, the 50-day would cross above the 200-day SMA, which would cause a golden cross to form.\n\nBullish traders want to see Dogecoin continue to trade sideways and then for big bullish volume to come in and break the crypto up above Thursday’s high-of-day. Bearish traders want to see big bearish volume drop Dogecoin back under the 200-day SMA.\n\nDogecoin has resistance above at $0.075 and at $0.083 and support below at $0.069 and at $0.065.\n\nRead Next: EXCLUSIVE: Bitcoin Rally Ahead?

The news articles suggest a growing interest in cryptocurrency ETFs, particularly with BlackRock filing for an Ethereum trust and Nasdaq proposing an ETF tied to ether. This development has led to a surge in the price of Ethereum, reaching its highest level since April. Additionally, Bitcoin has also seen an increase in value, with hopes of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval by the SEC.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing a bearish trend with potential further price declines. The open prices have been fluctuating, but overall, the indicators point towards a downward trajectory. The news analyst report presents a mixed outlook for Ethereum, with technological advancements and potential price fluctuations in the near future. However, the long-term growth potential of Ethereum remains a key factor in generating positive returns on investments.

Considering the reflection analyst report, it is evident that prioritizing on-chain analysis has been successful in making profitable trading decisions. Short-term news reports may present uncertainties, but long-term strategies focusing on on-chain metrics, regulatory challenges, and market sentiment are crucial for managing risks effectively and capitalizing on growth opportunities in the volatile cryptocurrency market.

Based on the synthesized reports, the clear market trend for ETH appears to be bearish in the short term, with potential for price declines. However, the long-term growth potential of Ethereum remains promising. Therefore, a slightly conservative trading approach is warranted to manage risks effectively while capitalizing on long-term growth opportunities.

Given the current market trend and the emphasis on long-term strategies, I would take a cautious approach and assign a trading action of -0.5, reflecting moderate confidence in the bearish short-term trend and the importance of managing risks for long-term gains.
ACTION:
-0.5
DAILY RETURN:
-0.0005260132274172991
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain, news, and reflection analyst reports, it is evident that the current market trend for ETH is bearish in the short term due to the downward trend indicated by the sell signals in the MACD analysis, challenges in price performance, and potential regulatory impacts. However, there are positive long-term growth prospects highlighted in terms of Ethereum's deflationary aspect, successful transition to proof-of-stake, and potential as a valuable asset in the long term.

Considering the uncertainties in the short term and the importance of long-term growth potential, it is advisable to adopt a slightly conservative trading approach to navigate market uncertainties and potential price declines while focusing on long-term growth prospects. Prioritizing on-chain analysis for making profitable trading decisions, managing risks effectively, and capitalizing on growth opportunities is crucial in the volatile cryptocurrency market.

Therefore, I would take a slightly conservative approach and assign a trading action of 0.3, reflecting moderate confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately while keeping an eye on long-term growth prospects in ETH trading.
ACTION:
0.3
DAILY RETURN:
0.06253273997348763
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently bearish, with indications of further price declines in the near future. The average gas price is increasing, and there is volatility in the number of unique addresses and successful transactions. However, the news analyst report presents a contrasting view, highlighting positive developments such as BlackRock's plans to launch an Ethereum spot ETF and the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF by the SEC. The shift to a proof-of-stake system with the Ethereum Merge is also expected to attract more investors.

Considering the reflection analyst report, it is evident that prioritizing on-chain analysis and long-term growth prospects has been successful in making profitable trading decisions. Short-term news reports may introduce uncertainties and potential losses in profit. Therefore, a slightly conservative trading approach that balances risk management with potential gains is recommended.

In conclusion, while short-term indicators may suggest a bearish market trend, the long-term prospects for Ethereum appear positive due to strategic developments and technological advancements. As a result, I would take a slightly bullish stance on the market trend and opt for a trading action of 0.5, reflecting moderate confidence in the long-term growth potential of ETH while also considering risk management.

However, prices have since sharply recovered, adding roughly 40% from October lows and shaking off the weakness registered on August 17 when the coin plunged by 14%.\n\nToken Terminal data shows that Ethereum’s daily revenue has steadily risen in the first ten days of November. Looking at trends, the average daily income has doubled from $5 million in the first five days of the month. Usually, an uptick in daily average revenue in a network points to increasing on-chain activity either through smart contract deployment or simple transfers, which necessitates the payment of gas fees.\n\nImproving Scalability In The Long Term\n\nHow the widespread adoption of Ethereum layer-2 and sidechain scaling solutions will impact the network revenue is not immediately apparent. }\n\nWhat’s clear is that the more protocols leverage the protocol, deploying multiple solutions, the more revenue the network will generate for validators and stakers. Staking rewards are drawn partly from transaction fees paid as gas, new issuance, and burned miner extractable value (MEV).\n\nStill, the dollar value of ETH minted as revenue depends on spot rates. If the uptrend is sustained, this figure will continue expanding. Even so, there might be more demand for the network, which is still struggling to scale on-chain.\n\nEthereum 2.0 aims to resolve these challenges in the coming years by increasing the general throughput via solutions like Sharding. Sharding will split Ethereum into small but interconnected networks called shards. Each shard will independently process each set of transactions and maintain its state, allowing the mainnet to scale.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

He pointed out how the ETH/BTC pair finally broke the wedge to the downside, highlighting that it’s akin to what happened in the last cycle.\n\nAs he connects the dots, the Ether-Bitcoin pair is potentially backtesting the trendline that served as support in October 2022, March 2023, June 2023, and September 2023. Since the ETH/BTC pair is now testing from beneath the wedge in November 2023, it could offer a significant resistance level.\n\nHowever, Cowen cautions that even if ETH/BTC manages to move above the trendline, the pair will encounter several resistance levels to the upside. These levels must be successfully flipped as support to convincingly reverse the downtrend.\n\nHe further explained, stating that, there are numerous resistance levels. Whether one opts to depict them horizontally or analyze them differently, ETH/BTC still faces a significant challenge. It must have to overcome these resistance levels to indicate a meaningful reversal.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH/BTC is valued at 0.05578 BTC, equivalent to $2,068.80 on Tradingview. Meanwhile, BTC/USDT is valued at $37,112, according to Coingecko.\n\nETF expectations\n\nThe recent surge in Bitcoin and Ethereum has significantly influenced the cryptocurrency market.\n\nBitcoin has reached $37,000, marking highs not seen since May 2022. This may be driven by the ongoing expectation that U.S. regulators approve a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nSimultaneously, Ethereum has rallied close to $2,100, reclaiming the $2,000 level for the first time since mid-July. The rise in digital assets, especially XRP, may also be attributed to Bitcoin surpassing $35,000.\n\nAdditionally, news about BlackRock planning to file for an ETH-based ETF may have also fueled Ethereum’s upward momentum.\n\nFollowing the anticipation of the ETF approval, which has propelled cryptocurrency prices and related stocks, This rally could be part of a broader uptrend in the crypto sector, recognized as a significant $17.7 trillion opportunity by market strategists.\n\nHowever, altcoins like XRP, DOGE, UNI, and XLM have experienced declines, possibly due to a pause in capital rotation towards smaller tokens.\n\nFed chair Jerome Powell recently delivered a policy address to the Economic Club of New York, providing insights into the current state of the US economy and monetary policy.\n\nThis statement is significant given the critical juncture of the U.S. economy, marked by improving inflation figures alongside surging Treasury yields, creating conflicting signals about the direction of monetary policy.\n\nInterpreted as a signal, Powell’s statement suggests that the Fed might persist with its tightening cycle, contrary to recent market expectations of a more dovish approach.\n\nRead more: Bitwise withdraws bitcoin and ethereum ETF application\n\nFollow Us on Google News'}]

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain, news, and reflection analyst reports, it is evident that the current market trend for ETH is bearish in the short term due to the downward trend indicated by the sell signals in the MACD analysis, challenges in price performance, and potential regulatory impacts. However, there are positive long-term growth prospects highlighted in terms of Ethereum's deflationary aspect, successful transition to proof-of-stake, and potential as a valuable asset in the long term.

Considering the uncertainties in the short term and the importance of long-term growth potential, it is advisable to adopt a slightly conservative trading approach to navigate market uncertainties and potential price declines while focusing on long-term growth prospects. Prioritizing on-chain analysis for making profitable trading decisions, managing risks effectively, and capitalizing on growth opportunities is crucial in the volatile cryptocurrency market.

Therefore, I would take a slightly conservative approach and assign a trading action of 0.3, reflecting moderate confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately while keeping an eye on long-term growth prospects in ETH trading.

The shift to a proof-of-stake system with the Ethereum Merge is also expected to attract more investors.

Considering the reflection analyst report, it is evident that prioritizing on-chain analysis and long-term growth prospects has been successful in making profitable trading decisions. Short-term news reports may introduce uncertainties and potential losses in profit. Therefore, a slightly conservative trading approach that balances risk management with potential gains is recommended.

In conclusion, while short-term indicators may suggest a bearish market trend, the long-term prospects for Ethereum appear positive due to strategic developments and technological advancements.

Eric Smith, Chief Investment Officer at 401 Financials, posted that the revenue had hit $10 million again. From the data coined from Token Terminal, the last time the Ethereum blockchain hit such levels was in July.\n\nETH price wasn’t the only thing that was up yesterday. Ethereum’s one day revenue hit $10 million for the first time since July. 📈 via @tokenterminal pic.twitter.com/hw2wZdVtoO — Erik Smith, CFP® (@eriksmithcfp) November 10, 2023\n\nFor the unfamiliar, Ethereum makes its revenue mainly from network fees it charges users of the blockchain. Hence, the increase in revenue means that there was a surge in activity on the blockchain during the week.\n\nThe surge in revenue also means that there must have been an increase in the average gas price. According to information from Etherscan, ETH’s average transaction fee tapped 57.1 on 9th November.\n\nThe Ethereum gas measures the amount of computational effort required to make transactions on the network. It also serves as a way of incentivizing validators on the blockchain. For context, validators are people responsible for keeping the Ethereum network working.\n\nActivity rises, then dips\n\nThis value was the highest in the last 30 days, meaning that there was an increase in demand for ETH. Elsewhere, Ethereum’s network growth rose to 78,500. Network growth shows the number of new addresses being created on the blockchain.\n\nWhen the metric increases, it means user adoption is growing on the network. A decrease implies that traction has reduced. So, the initial jump suggests that new addresses were transacting actively on Ethereum.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nBut at the time of writing, the network growth had dropped to 29,300. Like the network growth, active addresses on the Ethereum network also climbed to 459,000 on 10 November. Active addresses show the level of interaction or speculation around a token.\n\nTherefore, the metric at that time means that deposits on the network were at impressive levels. However, the press time state of the active addresses showed that the metric had decreased.\n\nLooking at the current state of Ethereum, the drop in gas fees has affected the revenue. Going forward, to surpass the $10 billion, the demand for ETH needs to increase more than it has recently.'}]

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently bearish, with indications of further price declines in the near future. The average gas price is increasing, and there is volatility in the number of unique addresses and successful transactions. However, the news analyst report presents a contrasting view, highlighting positive developments such as BlackRock's plans to launch an Ethereum spot ETF and the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF by the SEC. The shift to a proof-of-stake system with the Ethereum Merge is also expected to attract more investors.

Considering the reflection analyst report, it is evident that prioritizing on-chain analysis and long-term growth prospects has been successful in making profitable trading decisions. Short-term news reports may introduce uncertainties and potential losses in profit. Therefore, a slightly conservative trading approach that balances risk management with potential gains is recommended.

In conclusion, while short-term indicators may suggest a bearish market trend, the long-term prospects for Ethereum appear positive due to strategic developments and technological advancements. As a result, I would take a slightly bullish stance on the market trend and opt for a trading action of 0.5, reflecting moderate confidence in the long-term growth potential of ETH while also considering risk management.
ACTION:
0.5
DAILY RETURN:
-0.018877797927672746
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing a downward trend with bearish sentiment. The fluctuation in open price, high gas prices, and stable number of transactions all point towards a cautious approach for investors. Additionally, the news analyst report highlights a bullish trend in the market due to growing interest in cryptocurrency ETFs, which has led to a surge in the price of Ethereum. However, it is important to note that short-term news reports may introduce uncertainties and potential losses in profit.

Reflecting on the recent trading performance, it is evident that a focus on on-chain analysis and long-term growth prospects has been successful in making profitable trading decisions. It is crucial to continue monitoring key trends such as the bearish short-term market trend for ETH, potential price declines, and positive long-term growth prospects. A slightly conservative trading approach is recommended to navigate market uncertainties and capitalize on long-term growth opportunities while managing risks effectively.

Considering the synthesized reports and the emphasis on long-term strategies over short-term gains, I would take a cautious approach and assign a trading action of 0.3, reflecting moderate confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.
ACTION:

DAILY RETURN:

REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that ETH has been experiencing a downward trend with a bearish market signal. The average gas price has been increasing, indicating potential challenges for short-term price growth. However, the number of successful transactions remains high, suggesting active trading activity despite the bearish trend.

On the other hand, the news analyst report paints a bullish sentiment towards Ethereum, with predictions of significant price increases and positive market outlook. The surge in daily revenue and increasing on-chain activity further support the positive sentiment towards ETH.

In reflection, it is clear that a balance between on-chain analysis and long-term growth prospects is crucial for making profitable trading decisions. While short-term news reports can introduce uncertainties, focusing on key trends and managing risks effectively can lead to moderate returns.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is advisable to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains in the current market environment. Despite the bearish short-term trend indicated by the on-chain analysis, the positive news sentiment and potential for price growth suggest a favorable long-term outlook for ETH.

Therefore, my trading action would be to buy ETH with a confidence level of 0.7, reflecting a moderately positive outlook for long-term growth while acknowledging the short-term challenges indicated by the on-chain analysis. By balancing risk management and growth opportunities, this strategic decision aims to maximize overall profit in the volatile cryptocurrency market.

*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the short-term trend for ETH is bearish due to the consistent decrease in open price, high gas prices, and the sell signal on the MACD indicator. On the other hand, the news analyst report suggests a bullish sentiment in the market, driven by institutional interest, positive price predictions, and growing activity on the Ethereum blockchain.

In light of these conflicting reports, it is important to take a balanced approach that considers both short-term indicators and long-term growth prospects. While the short-term trend may be bearish, the potential for further growth in the cryptocurrency market, especially with the increasing institutional interest in Ethereum, indicates a positive long-term outlook.

Therefore, it is recommended to adopt a slightly conservative trading approach that balances risk management with growth opportunities. This involves monitoring on-chain indicators, news sentiment, and market trends to make informed decisions that maximize overall profit.

Considering the overall market trend and the importance of long-term strategies, I would take a cautious approach and make a trading action of 0.3, reflecting moderate confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately. This allows for potential gains while also considering the uncertainties and volatility in the market.

The milestone was driven by a sharp uptick in activity on Solana, with the network hosting only 208,000 active addresses on Nov. 7.\n\nFor comparison, Ethereum consistently hosted between 290,000 and 350,000 users daily over the majority of the past three months, with two brief spikes above 400,000 and a surge to more than 1M wallets.\n\nSolana Overtakes Ethereum By Active Users After 70% Spike\n\nThe milestone is the latest sign of Solana’s recovery following last year’s brutal bear and the fallout from the collapse of its major investor, FTX.\n\nThe price of SOL plummeted more than 96% from its November 2021 all-time high of $250 to less than $10 in January, according to CoinGecko. Active addresses on the network shrank 85% from 1.28M in May 2022 to around 200,000 this September, according to The Block.\n\nBut Solana refused to stay down, with the network outperforming the broader markets amid the recent cryptocurrency rally as evidenced by the recent surge in active addresses.\n\nThe price of SOL is up 145% in four weeks, beating out many rival digital assets by at least double. The total value locked in Solana-based DeFi protocols is up 62% over the same period, according to DeFi Llama, while NFT sales volume grew 35% in the past 30 days, according to Crypto Slam.\n\nThe move followed progress towards Solana's firedancer upgrade in the form of a testnet, and dissipating expectations that the FTX bankruptcy estate would soon offload large sums of SOL on the markets.\n\nEthereum’s Layer 2s\n\nWhile some analysts have been quick to pronounce that Solana has flipped Ethereum by active users in response to the recent uptick in activity. However, the Ethereum ecosystem has expanded beyond its base-layer, with the majority of activity now taking place on Layer 2.\n\nAccording to data from Token Terminal, more than 800,000 users were active on the top seven Layer 2 networks over the past day combined. Coupled with the Ethereum mainnet, the data suggests more than 1M wallets were active across the Ethereum ecosystem. However, said data does not account for users operating the same wallet across multiple networks.\n\nAccording to L2beat, Layer 2 networks are driving 80% of activity in Ethereum’s broader ecosystem, which is driving roughly 60 transactions per second.\n\nTo continue reading this as well as other DeFi and Web3 news, visit us at thedefiant.io"}, {'id': 10, 'time': 'Mon, 13 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Solana Hits New Annual High At $58 — Analyst Predicts 'Ethereum Killer' Could Skyrocket To $1000 - Nasdaq", 'content': 'Solana (CRYPTO: SOL), once called an ‘Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) killer\' has experienced a remarkable surge in price, surging by 40% in the past week and reaching a new high for the year 2023 at approximately $58.\n\nWhat Happened: Crypto analyst Jacob Canfield has conducted a comprehensive analysis suggesting that Solana could be on the verge of an unprecedented market surge. Canfield suggests that Solana could potentially increase its market dominance to the range of 12-15%.\n\nCanfield’s analysis is based on several indicators. He highlights the Solana Dominance (SOL.D) chart, noting that even at its peak market cap, it didn’t surpass 3%. With the current trends and the breakout of SOLBTC from its weekly resistance, Canfield envisions a scenario where Solana could enter a parabolic rally phase.\n\nIn my opinion, I think that @Solana is going to continue to be one of the biggest movers during this current bull market cycle and I\'m going to lay out some ideas for you.It\'s possible that with the Ethereum ETF news that some of these ideas don\'t play out, but it\'s worth… pic.twitter.com/oii8vWs0W9\n\n— Jacob Canfield (@JacobCanfield) November 9, 2023\n\nCanfield suggests that if Solana continues to trend against Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), it could easily reach a price of $1,000 per coin and claim the second spot behind Bitcoin. "Solana could triple or quadruple it\'s all time high market dominance around 12-15% and if it continues to trend against Bitcoin, could easily see a $1,000 per coin and take the #2 spot behind Bitcoin," the analyst said.\n\nWill The SEC Finally Approve Long-Awaited Bitcoin Spot ETF?

The popular digital currency has recently surged to levels not seen in almost eighteen months.\n\nSince taking out the $32,000 level of resistance near the end of October, the price of one bitcoin has surged to $38,000. The last time the bitcoin price traded near this level was over a year ago, in May 2022.\n\nBitcoin and another leading, popular digital currency, Ethereum (ETH), have also been in the headlines for reasons other than price surges.

Analysts have estimated a January approval at the earliest, emphasizing the SEC\'s cautious stance. Recent speculation suggests potential decisions on applications from BlackRock and Fidelity, but the SEC extended the timeline for the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF to Jan. 10.\n\nSo, as speculation grows and the price for several popular digital currencies surges, here’s a list of four crypto-related stocks that could see rapid price appreciation should breaking news occur.\n\nFour crypto-related stocks to keep an eye on\n\nMarathon Digital (NASDAQ: MARA)\n\nMara is a Las Vegas-based digital asset technology company. The company specializes in blockchain-based mining and produces digital assets such as Bitcoin. Shares of the crypto company have skyrocketed this year, up about 180%. However, the stock has failed to join the latest crypto uptrend and, over the previous three months, fell almost 36%.\n\nMicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR)\n\nMicroStrategy is a global provider of enterprise analytics software and services. MicroStrategy is actively involved with Bitcoin, holding and acquiring the cryptocurrency as part of its strategic investment strategy. As of November 1, 2023, MicroStrategy possesses 158,400 bitcoins, acquired at an average purchase price of $29,609.65 per bitcoin, resulting in a total investment of $4.69 billion.\n\nCoinbase Global (NASDAQ: COIN)\n\nCoinbase Global is a major cryptocurrency exchange offering tools for trading over 200 cryptocurrencies. COIN shares have performed exceptionally on the year by any standard, up almost 163% and recently rallying double-digits off key support in the $70s. However, analysts are not bullish on the stock, with a consensus Hold rating and a price target of $75.64, predicting almost 19% downside.\n\nRiot Platforms (NASDAQ: RIOT)\n\nRiot is a U.S. blockchain technology company that strives to be the premier provider of Bitcoin mining services in North America. The company offers cryptocurrency mining hardware, hosting services, and proprietary software. Shares of RIOT have impressed this year, to say the least, up 205%.

This revolutionary innovation simplifies cryptocurrency transactions and token offerings on the Ethereum blockchain, ushering in a new era of user-friendly accessibility.\n\nThe platform has already embarked on alpha testing, with an accelerated beta version scheduled for release within a week.\n\nRevolutionary Technology\n\nTokenum\'s gasless technology marks a significant advancement in the cryptocurrency landscape for several compelling reasons.\n\n1) Innovative Gas-free Transactions\n\nIn traditional banking, transaction fees are paid using the same currency that is being transacted. However, in the world of cryptocurrency, fees are often paid in another, blockchain-specific digital currencies. Such fees are referred to as "gas." Tokenum\'s gasless technology eliminates the need for users to grapple with this complex concept, making cryptocurrency more accessible to a broader audience.\n\n2) Supercharged Token Sales\n\nNew cryptocurrency projects face various challenges, including scheduling, legal compliance, compatible wallets, and sale regulations. Additionally, for users to participate in project sales, users must first acquire specific coins to cover blockchain gas fees. Tokenum\'s gasless technology simplifies this process, making it easier for crypto projects to attract users and maximize revenue from each sale.\n\n3) NFT Industry Transformation\n\nTokenum\'s gasless technology presents an opportunity to reshape the NFT industry. NFT creators and owners can now prepay for NFT transfers, removing the burden of gas payments for users. This opens the door to entirely new audiences and streamlines the process, making it as effortless as managing digital art on Instagram or Pinterest.\n\n4) Removal of Entry Barriers for New Ecosystems\n\nTokenum also benefits new blockchains by allowing users to leverage the tokens they already have, eliminating the need to acquire blockchain-specialized coins for different networks and ecosystems. This significantly simplifies the sophisticated process of navigating and using new blockchains, platforms, or even metaverses.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll Gas No Brakes and Light-Years Ahead\n\nOne of the most notable aspects of Tokenum is its current full-fledged operational status. While other industry players, such as Circle Inc., Auros, 0xGasless, Open Zeppelin, and more, are still in the developmental stages, Tokenum is live and fully functional on the Ethereum network. The platform\'s future plans include expanding its support to encompass additional networks.\n\nThe AI-Powered CEO Behind Tokenum\n\nTokenum\'s powerful technology is spearheaded by a distinctive team, represented by Takeshi Tokenai, an AI-powered CEO. Notably, Takeshi was formally appointed as the leader on July 1, 2021, making him the world\'s first AI CEO. Conversely, Tokenum\'s technological prowess is underpinned by the collective expertise of its international team, boasting two decades of experience in the realms of cybersecurity, high technology, and blockchain. When asked to share their comments on the matter, Takeshi Tokenai\'s only statement was: "Tokenum is here to take the crypto world by storm."\n\nWhat Lies Ahead\n\nIn summary, Tokenum\'s gasless technology is reshaping the cryptocurrency landscape by simplifying transactions, facilitating token sales, and supporting the growth of new blockchains. Now the project is already integrated with CyberWallet, the one of the most secure wallets at the market, and HyperID, the single identity solution.

The news articles suggest a positive trend for Solana (SOL) in the cryptocurrency market. Solana has experienced a surge in active users, price, and market dominance, potentially surpassing Ethereum (ETH) in terms of market cap. Additionally, the introduction of gasless technology by Tokenum on the Ethereum blockchain could further enhance the accessibility and usability of cryptocurrencies. With the excitement surrounding Solana's performance and the advancements in Ethereum's ecosystem, the market trend for both SOL and ETH appears to be bullish, with potential for further growth and adoption in the near future.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing a downward trend with bearish sentiment. The fluctuation in open price, high gas prices, and stable number of transactions all point towards a cautious approach for investors. Additionally, the news analyst report highlights a bullish trend in the market due to growing interest in cryptocurrency ETFs, which has led to a surge in the price of Ethereum. However, it is important to note that short-term news reports may introduce uncertainties and potential losses in profit.

Reflecting on the recent trading performance, it is evident that a focus on on-chain analysis and long-term growth prospects has been successful in making profitable trading decisions. It is crucial to continue monitoring key trends such as the bearish short-term market trend for ETH, potential price declines, and positive long-term growth prospects. A slightly conservative trading approach is recommended to navigate market uncertainties and capitalize on long-term growth opportunities while managing risks effectively.

Considering the synthesized reports and the emphasis on long-term strategies over short-term gains, I would take a cautious approach and assign a trading action of 0.3, reflecting moderate confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.

REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that ETH has been experiencing a downward trend with a bearish market signal. The average gas price has been increasing, indicating potential challenges for short-term price growth. However, the number of successful transactions remains high, suggesting active trading activity despite the bearish trend.

On the other hand, the news analyst report paints a bullish sentiment towards Ethereum, with predictions of significant price increases and positive market outlook. The surge in daily revenue and increasing on-chain activity further support the positive sentiment towards ETH.

In reflection, it is clear that a balance between on-chain analysis and long-term growth prospects is crucial for making profitable trading decisions. While short-term news reports can introduce uncertainties, focusing on key trends and managing risks effectively can lead to moderate returns.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is advisable to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains in the current market environment. Despite the bearish short-term trend indicated by the on-chain analysis, the positive news sentiment and potential for price growth suggest a favorable long-term outlook for ETH.

Therefore, my trading action would be to buy ETH with a confidence level of 0.7, reflecting a moderately positive outlook for long-term growth while acknowledging the short-term challenges indicated by the on-chain analysis. By balancing risk management and growth opportunities, this strategic decision aims to maximize overall profit in the volatile cryptocurrency market.

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the short-term trend for ETH is bearish due to the consistent decrease in open price, high gas prices, and the sell signal on the MACD indicator. On the other hand, the news analyst report suggests a bullish sentiment in the market, driven by institutional interest, positive price predictions, and growing activity on the Ethereum blockchain.

In light of these conflicting reports, it is important to take a balanced approach that considers both short-term indicators and long-term growth prospects. While the short-term trend may be bearish, the potential for further growth in the cryptocurrency market, especially with the increasing institutional interest in Ethereum, indicates a positive long-term outlook.

Therefore, it is recommended to adopt a slightly conservative trading approach that balances risk management with growth opportunities. This involves monitoring on-chain indicators, news sentiment, and market trends to make informed decisions that maximize overall profit.

Considering the overall market trend and the importance of long-term strategies, I would take a cautious approach and make a trading action of 0.3, reflecting moderate confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.

BLK expands cryptocurrency exposure as the firm files for a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF), named iShares Ethereum Trust, with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The filing was submitted by Nasdaq exchange on behalf of the asset manager.\n\n\n\nFollowing the announcement of this filing, the price of Ethereum surged to its highest level this year before pulling back afterward.\n\n\n\nThe Ethereum ETF, if approved, will be the first of its kind in the United States, allowing investors to gain exposure to Ethereum without having to purchase the cryptocurrency directly.\n\n\n\nThe ETF would track the spot price of Ethereum, meaning that investors would be investing in the price of Ethereum itself rather than in a company that is involved in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n\n\nThe move by BLK has once again injected optimism into the crypto markets while initiating discussions around SEC’s regulatory approach to cryptocurrency-based ETFs.\n\n\n\nThe jump in the price of Ethereum is similar to Bitcoin rally experienced this June when BLK had filed an application with SEC to offer a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\n\n\nIn July, SEC said that the applications filed by BLK and other asset managers for spot Bitcoin ETF were inadequate because the filings did not have enough detail with respect to the “surveillance-sharing agreements”. BLK’s Bitcoin ETF is expected to be approved by SEC by the first quarter of 2024.\n\n\n\nNotably, in June, BLK became the first asset manager to file for the spot Bitcoin ETF, paving the way for a wave of filings by other asset managers like Fidelity, Invesco IVZ and WisdomTree WT.\n\n\n\nThe applications had come at a time when the cryptocurrency industry was already battling criticism by SEC over alleged securities law violations.\n\n\n\nCoinbase and the world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance, were already sued by SEC, alleging securities violations.\n\n\n\nThus, SEC had proposed new custody rules that would place additional responsibilities on asset managers to make sure that customers’ assets were kept in properly segregated accounts.\n\n\n\nIn October 2021, IVZ withdrew its original application for a Bitcoin ETF (made earlier in 2021) because of regulatory headwinds within the industry. At that time, SEC was resistant in approving such funds due to concerns over potential fraud and market manipulation.\n\n\n\nLikewise, in October 2022, WT’s application for the launch of the WisdomTree Bitcoin Trust was not approved by SEC on account of insufficient investor protection.\n\n\n\nHowever, the fact that BLK is filing for a spot Ethereum ETF, following an application for a spot Bitcoin ETF, shows that this asset manager wants to expand its presence in the cryptocurrency markets, signaling a shift in the regulatory landscape.\n\n\n\nOver the past six months, shares of BLK have gained 2.6% compared with the industry’s 8.9% growth.\n\n\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCurrently, BlackRock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Do you think the Fed's done hiking rates? I do think the Fed is done hiking. And good morning to you guys. I think that the the inflation data was very positive and it's likely to go lower over the next quarter. And so Rick Rieder, a personal friend of mine, actually gave a presentation in Park City at Governor Romney's conference about a month ago and explained the the churning down of inflation. And I think that's very, very good for stock prices, very good for assets. But, of course, what do people want for Christmas in America? They want a low interest rate mortgage. And if you look at housing data in the United States right now, those markets are quite sluggish. I think the Fed is going to respond to that. You'll probably see cuts in interest rates before the end of the first quarter. And so that's very positive for asset prices across the board. Okay. You mentioned last time Bloomberg spoke with you about, you know, you had a great October for your fund. I think it's the best month you've had in the history of SkyBridge. A lot of it was crypto, which I'll get to later. But what what's the other part of that? I mean, is there any parts of that of your portfolio that really kind of benefit from maybe either higher for longer or a less sort of tightening environment? I guess who else, unfortunately, versus the bets that hurt us last year? We we left on for this year. And so unfortunately in investing, sometimes you can get the timing wrong. But we made the case in the fourth quarter of last year in the early part of 2023, that the Fed would start cutting rates more quickly, that inflation would come down more quickly once the supply chain had reconnected. And you saw all of this induction of new technology like A.I., robotic technology, etc., bringing down prices. And so we got the timing wrong. But if you're a long term investor, if you were patient with us, you did quite well. And and last year at this time here at this all conference, as I mentioned during the commercial break, I think Bitcoin was about 16 or 17,000. We have a 10% position in Bitcoin in our portfolio and of course that's gone up to 35, 36,000 in the last year. And I think that went up contrary to institutional sentiment at the time. Over the last year people were quite negative. I was in Davos, Switzerland, being interviewed by some of your colleagues. January of this year, everyone had written off Bitcoin. Of course, it went up about 115% since then. So it's a combination of a couple of different factors, but it's mostly about being bullish about the return of the global economy and global growth. post-COVID. It just took longer than people expected, but we're there now. Yeah, from 6000 to 35. Now, you mentioned 10% weighting. How are you managing your exposure to crypto? What do you suspect the changes will be over the next couple of months? Anthony? Well, I mean, I think one of the things we're very proud of is we're we were the first outside capital into the BlackRock Bitcoin Trust. And so as you guys know, they filed for a formal application with the SCC, the deadline for that application at least for the Ark application, Cathie Wood's is January 10th. It appears likely that these things will get approved if that happens. I think there's an induction of a tremendous amount of demand for Bitcoin and of course you have a happening in Bitcoin, which basically means the supply is going to get cut in half in April. So having lower supply, more demand, we think prices are going to trend higher for Bitcoin, Etherium and a few other currencies. And for those reasons we're going to stay long in the portfolio. And you know what? Well, you know, it's a concentrated bet for us, but we like it. It's a macro overlay. And I guess you guys will remember the beginning part of the year with the Silicon Valley bank crises. Bitcoin was quite resilient and it seems to also do what you'd want an alternative investment to do is go contra into carry indicatori to the overall market. And I think it's safe to say you're still deep into crypto. And of course, obviously your name was mentioned during those SBF trials. Well, I want to get your take on the verdict now that we have one here as well. And overall the future of FDX 2.0. Would you invest in it? Would I invest in it? Well, depends on who's running it. I think number one, I think if you read Michael Lewis's book, there was a business there. He had 12 and a half percent of the cryptocurrency market. So I think the sloppiness and the indiscretion and the eventual fraud obviously ruined the the business and ruin the reputation of that business. But there is a good. Underlying business of you. Tell me who's managing it. I would be open minded to that. But since you're mentioning FDA, I think it's important to point out to ..."}]

ON-CHAIN ANALYST REPORT:
"""
The ETH cryptocurrency has been experiencing a downward trend recently, as indicated by the sell signal on the MACD indicator in the provided data. The open prices have been fluctuating between 1891.49 and 2128.61, with a decreasing trend in total gas used, unique addresses, total value transferred, and average gas price. The number of successful transactions has also been declining, indicating a decrease in overall market activity. Based on this information, it is likely that the market trend for ETH will continue to be bearish in the near future.
"""

NEWS ANALYST REPORT:
"""
The news articles indicate a growing interest and expansion of cryptocurrency trading in the market, particularly for Bitcoin and Ethereum. With CBOE launching margin futures trading for Bitcoin and Ethereum in January 2024, and BlackRock filing for an Ethereum ETF, there is a clear indication of institutional involvement and acceptance of cryptocurrencies. Additionally, SkyBridge's Scaramucci predicts higher prices for Bitcoin and Ethereum in the coming months, citing increased demand and reduced supply as key factors. This overall positive sentiment towards cryptocurrencies suggests a bullish trend in the market, with potential for price appreciation and increased adoption.

*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market has been experiencing a bearish trend with decreasing indicators such as total gas used, unique addresses, total value transferred, and successful transactions. This suggests a potential continuation of the downward trend in the near future.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights a positive sentiment towards cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, with institutional involvement and positive price predictions. This indicates a bullish trend in the market with potential for price appreciation and increased adoption.

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a balanced approach considering both on-chain analysis and news sentiment has been effective in making profitable trading decisions. Prioritizing long-term growth prospects over short-term gains has been successful in navigating market uncertainties and volatility.

Considering the conflicting reports, it is important to take a slightly conservative trading approach in the current cryptocurrency market environment. While short-term gains may be tempting, focusing on long-term strategies and managing risks effectively is crucial for maximizing overall profit.

Therefore, I would take a slightly bearish stance on the ETH market with a trading action of -0.3, reflecting a moderate level of confidence in the bearish trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.

Grayscale Investments, a major player in the digital asset management sector, submitted the ETF request in September, aiming to provide investors with exposure to the anticipated future price movements of Ethereum.\n\nKnown for routinely extending timelines for crypto-related product decisions, the SEC clarified that it needs additional time to thoroughly assess the proposed changes in regulations and address related issues. While Grayscale's application revolves around an ETF tied to Ethereum futures, the SEC is currently managing a backlog of spot Bitcoin ETF applications, including those from significant Wall Street players such as BlackRock.\n\nDespite persistent investor demand for a Bitcoin ETF, the SEC has consistently rejected previous applications, citing concerns about potential market manipulation. However, Ethereum futures ETFs made their recent debut in the U.S. market, with several firms introducing a total of nine products on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) just last month.\n\nGrayscale has actively been in discussions with the SEC, previously taking legal action against the regulator over its rejection of a spot Bitcoin ETF application. Despite these delays, analysts from Bloomberg Intelligence project a 90% likelihood of the SEC approving a Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. by January 10, 2024.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."}, {'id': 7, 'time': 'Wed, 15 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum (ETH) Might Drop to $1,700 If It Breaks This Key Level - U.Today', 'content': "Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today.

According to the crypto analyst, the king of the altcoins has its top just right after $10,000 using the Fibonacci extension.\n\nHow Ethereum Gets To $10,000\n\nIn the latest issue of the CoinChartist newsletter, crypto analyst Tony The Bull used the Hurst Cycle Theory which showed cyclical reoccurrence across the ETH/USDT chart. As the analyst explains, the uptrend noticed in the Ethereum charts has usually come from the accumulation of the token.\n\nTony points out that this accumulation has always taken place “at the bottom boundary of the Ending Diagonal pattern.” The analyst further added that “Since intracycle harmonics come in twos and threes, three cycles should complete one larger cycle that concludes with a breakdown of this Ending Diagonal pattern.”\n\nTaking this Ending Diagonal Pattern into account, Tony reveals that the top of the pattern puts the ETH price at $10,000. However, this is not the only pattern that suggests that the king of the altcoins will end up beating the $10,000 level.\n\nHe also pointed out that the previous ETH rally had started at the 0.5 Fibonacci extension and reached 1.414 the last time that the ETH price peaked. The analyst notes that Ethereum is once again at the 0.5 Fibonacci extension which led to a break out in the price and the same could happen here. But this time, the target is able $10,000 if the 1.414 Fib is reached again.\n\nETH price reaches $2,019 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nETH Moves Into Overbought Territory\n\nOne interesting fact that the analyst points out in the newsletter is the fact that Ethereum is currently in overbought territory. However, where this would usually signal a bearish reversal coming for the digital asset, Tony does not believe this is the case here.\n\nRather, he explains that a cryptocurrency being overbought usually means that it is “a powerfully trending asset.” So even though it could lead to a reversal, it does not invalidate the bullishness of that digital asset.\n\nHe also mentions that “the Stochastic has confirmed a 1M above 80 on the Stock.” Now, whenever this has happened for Ethereum, it has often resulted in a pushup for the price. At the same time, ETH is moving to the upper Bollinger Band. Both of these setups could paint a bullish breakout for the asset.\n\nSource: CoinChartist\n\nHowever, the analyst warns that for this bullish scenario to play out, the Ethereum price would have to close above $2,450 this month. If the Stochastic moves back below 20, it could invalidate it and trigger a downtrend. “But if ETHBTC can push back above 20 this will generate a buy signal on the 1M Stochastic and kickstart Ether’s over-performance above Bitcoin,” Tony concluded.\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
The news articles suggest a mixed outlook for Ethereum (ETH) in the cryptocurrency market. While Infura's steps towards decentralization and Ethereum's potential breakout to $10,000 indicate positive sentiment, the SEC's delay in deciding on Grayscale Ethereum futures application and the possibility of a drop to $1,700 if a key level is breached introduce some uncertainty. Additionally, the rise in Ethereum fees and the cautious approach of the Federal Reserve towards interest rates may impact market dynamics.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the short-term trend for ETH is bearish due to the consistent decrease in open price, high gas prices, and the sell signal on the MACD indicator. On the other hand, the news analyst report suggests a bullish sentiment in the market, driven by institutional interest, positive price predictions, and growing activity on the Ethereum blockchain.

In light of these conflicting reports, it is important to take a balanced approach that considers both short-term indicators and long-term growth prospects. While the short-term trend may be bearish, the potential for further growth in the cryptocurrency market, especially with the increasing institutional interest in Ethereum, indicates a positive long-term outlook.

Therefore, it is recommended to adopt a slightly conservative trading approach that balances risk management with growth opportunities. This involves monitoring on-chain indicators, news sentiment, and market trends to make informed decisions that maximize overall profit.

Considering the overall market trend and the importance of long-term strategies, I would take a cautious approach and make a trading action of 0.3, reflecting moderate confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately. This allows for potential gains while also considering the uncertainties and volatility in the market.
ACTION:
0.3
DAILY RETURN:
0.006752424630855014
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that ETH has been experiencing a bearish trend with a decrease in open price and a sell signal on the MACD indicator. The market data also shows fluctuations in various metrics, indicating volatility in the market. On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights a positive trend for Solana and Ethereum, suggesting bullish market sentiment with potential growth opportunities.

In reflecting on the reports, it is clear that a balanced approach considering both on-chain analysis and news sentiment is crucial for making profitable trading decisions. While short-term uncertainties may lead to losses, prioritizing long-term growth prospects and managing risks effectively have been key factors in successful outcomes.

Taking into account the conflicting reports and market volatility, a slightly conservative trading approach is warranted to navigate uncertainties and capitalize on long-term growth opportunities. It is important to monitor key trends such as institutional interest, price predictions, and blockchain activity to make informed and strategic trading decisions.

Considering the overall analysis, the market trend for ETH appears to be uncertain in the short term but potentially bullish in the long term. Therefore, a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately and prioritize long-term gains over short-term profits is recommended.

As a result, my trading action would be to buy ETH with a confidence level of 0.6, indicating a moderate level of confidence in the potential long-term growth of ETH despite the current market uncertainties.
ACTION:

This suggests a potential continuation of the downward trend in the near future.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights a positive sentiment towards cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, with institutional involvement and positive price predictions.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that ETH has been experiencing a bearish trend with a decrease in open price and a sell signal on the MACD indicator. The market data also shows fluctuations in various metrics, indicating volatility in the market. On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights a positive trend for Solana and Ethereum, suggesting bullish market sentiment with potential growth opportunities.

In reflecting on the reports, it is clear that a balanced approach considering both on-chain analysis and news sentiment is crucial for making profitable trading decisions. While short-term uncertainties may lead to losses, prioritizing long-term growth prospects and managing risks effectively have been key factors in successful outcomes.

Taking into account the conflicting reports and market volatility, a slightly conservative trading approach is warranted to navigate uncertainties and capitalize on long-term growth opportunities. It is important to monitor key trends such as institutional interest, price predictions, and blockchain activity to make informed and strategic trading decisions.

Considering the overall analysis, the market trend for ETH appears to be uncertain in the short term but potentially bullish in the long term. Therefore, a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately and prioritize long-term gains over short-term profits is recommended.

As a result, my trading action would be to buy ETH with a confidence level of 0.6, indicating a moderate level of confidence in the potential long-term growth of ETH despite the current market uncertainties.
ACTION:
0.6
DAILY RETURN:
-0.03838327112107287
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market has been experiencing a bearish trend with decreasing indicators such as total gas used, unique addresses, total value transferred, and successful transactions. This suggests a potential continuation of the downward trend in the near future.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights a positive sentiment towards cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, with institutional involvement and positive price predictions. This indicates a bullish trend in the market with potential for price appreciation and increased adoption.

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a balanced approach considering both on-chain analysis and news sentiment has been effective in making profitable trading decisions. Prioritizing long-term growth prospects over short-term gains has been successful in navigating market uncertainties and volatility.

Considering the conflicting reports, it is important to take a slightly conservative trading approach in the current cryptocurrency market environment. While short-term gains may be tempting, focusing on long-term strategies and managing risks effectively is crucial for maximizing overall profit.

Therefore, I would take a slightly bearish stance on the ETH market with a trading action of -0.3, reflecting a moderate level of confidence in the bearish trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.
ACTION:
-0.3
DAILY RETURN:
0.027077166817057297
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market has been bearish recently, with indicators such as the MACD signal consistently showing a sell trend. The news analyst report presents a mixed outlook, with positive developments like Infura's decentralization efforts contrasting with uncertainties such as regulatory delays and potential price drops. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a balanced approach, considering both on-chain analysis and news sentiment for profitable trading decisions.

Taking into account the information from all three reports, it is evident that a cautious and long-term strategy is advisable in the current ETH market. While short-term gains may be possible, the overall trend appears to be influenced by a combination of factors that could lead to volatility. Therefore, it is crucial to prioritize long-term growth prospects and manage risks effectively.

Considering the bearish on-chain indicators, mixed news sentiment, and the recommendation for a slightly conservative approach, I would take a cautious stance in the current market. My trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.5, reflecting a moderate level of certainty in the bearish trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately for long-term growth.

"""
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market has been experiencing a bearish trend with decreasing indicators such as total gas used, unique addresses, total value transferred, and successful transactions. This suggests a potential continuation of the downward trend in the near future.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights a positive sentiment towards cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, with institutional involvement and positive price predictions. This indicates a bullish trend in the market with potential for price appreciation and increased adoption.

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a balanced approach considering both on-chain analysis and news sentiment has been effective in making profitable trading decisions. Prioritizing long-term growth prospects over short-term gains has been successful in navigating market uncertainties and volatility.

Considering the conflicting reports, it is important to take a slightly conservative trading approach in the current cryptocurrency market environment. While short-term gains may be tempting, focusing on long-term strategies and managing risks effectively is crucial for maximizing overall profit.

Therefore, I would take a slightly bearish stance on the ETH market with a trading action of -0.3, reflecting a moderate level of confidence in the bearish trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.

But these days, the Ethereum-killer narrative has given way to a focus on blockchain interoperability.\n\nMore than just a buzzword, interoperability is central to a Web3 philosophy committed to the free flow of information and value. It is also the driving force behind an increasingly connected ecosystem of decentralized apps (dApps) and services.\n\nThe dApp Developers Dilemma\n\nWith a headstart of several years, by the time the Solana mainnet launched, Ethereum already benefited from a strong network effect. Today, not only does it boast the most active developer community, but a powerful suite of dev tools and an established user base make Ethereum the go-to choice for most dApp builders.\n\nThat being said, the blockchain still has its drawbacks.\n\nCompared to Solana, Ethereum is slow, clunky and expensive. Sidechains and Layer 2s can scale capacity, but each has its trade-offs.\n\nIn 2023, rising interest in Solana’s potential has even seen its native token SOL significantly outperform ETH. As Ark Invest CEO Cathie Woods put it recently, “Ether was faster and cheaper than Bitcoin in the day — that’s how we got Ether. Solana is even faster and [more] cost-effective.”\n\nBringing Solana’s Power To Ethereum Developers\n\nLooking to create an Ethereum-like development environment on Solana, NeonEVM beta-launch occurred earlier this year, allowing Ethereum smart contracts to run on Solana for the first time.\n\n“Right now, Ethereum is the biggest ecosystem in the market,” CTO Andrey Falaleev said in an interview. “But without efficiency, it will not grow – there will be no evolution.”\n\nFrom a developer’s perspective, NeonEVM approximates the native Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). But the efficiency boost comes from Solana, with its superior transaction speed and lower gas fees.\n\nNeonEVM was designed to combine the best of Solana and Ethereum\n\nBy creating what Falaleev called “one world of communication,” the new platform allows two otherwise disconnected ecosystems can grow together.\n\nYet, if interoperability was just a matter of translation, a code compiler like Solang would be sufficient. To realize the full potential of Ethereum compatibility, NeonEVM needs a way to bridge assets from one blockchain to the other.\n\nInteroperability For A Frictionless User Experience\n\nTo port tokens from Ethereum, NeonEVM tapped deBridge. The latter is a decentralized interoperability layer that can transfer data and all manner of different tokens between various blockchains.\n\nThe most simple model for cross-chain bridges sees assets locked at one end while minting their wrapped equivalent at the other. But deBridge’s solution is a far more dynamic and general-purpose protocol for cross-chain transport and messaging.\n\nAs CEO Alex Smirnov explained to CCN, deBridge “allows any projects or any token holders to bridge any asset from other ecosystems to Neon.” For NeonEVM-based dApps, that means users don’t need to hold the network’s native token – NEON – but can pay gas fees in the transaction token.\n\nThe deBridge ecosystem is now seeing its highest daily volumes ever, much of it being passed between Ethereum and @Solana . It's only natural we should have Spaces with @ZetaMarkets and @SquadsProtocol 🔥 See you there in an hour👋https://t.co/gR2yPNSl1A — deBridge (@deBridgeFinance) November 16, 2023\n\nBecause solutions like NeonEVM and DeBridge increasingly abstract away the moving parts, “users can interact with any new data without the need to think about the underlying infrastructure, and even without the need to think about switching wallets or switching networks,” Smirnov observed.\n\nWith Web3 technologies seemingly on the cusp of mainstream adoption, this emerging multichain environment demonstrates the true power of interoperability: its potential to transform the experience of everyday dApp users."}]

While short-term gains may be possible, the overall trend appears to be influenced by a combination of factors that could lead to volatility. Therefore, it is crucial to prioritize long-term growth prospects and manage risks effectively.

Considering the bearish on-chain indicators, mixed news sentiment, and the recommendation for a slightly conservative approach, I would take a cautious stance in the current market.

The news analyst report, on the other hand, highlights positive developments such as the interest in Ethereum ETFs by traditional finance giants like BlackRock and the launch of Nocturne protocol, suggesting a bullish sentiment towards Ethereum.

Considering the reflection analyst report, it is evident that a balanced approach considering both on-chain analysis and news sentiment has been effective in making profitable decisions. The conflicting signals from on-chain indicators and news reports indicate short-term uncertainty in the market trends. Therefore, a slightly conservative trading approach focusing on long-term strategies and effective risk management is recommended to capitalize on potential price appreciation in the future.

In conclusion, the overall market trend for Ethereum appears to be positive in the long term, despite short-term volatility. Therefore, I would take a slightly bullish stance with a trading action of 0.5, reflecting moderate confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately for long-term gains.

NEWS ANALYST REPORT:
"""
The recent filings for spot Ethereum ETFs by Fidelity and BlackRock, along with the delay in decisions on multiple Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF applications by the US SEC, indicate a growing interest in cryptocurrency investment products. Additionally, the introduction of ERC 4337 for Ethereum rollups and the interoperability between Solana and Ethereum for dApps development show advancements in the Ethereum ecosystem. The significant outflows of over $1 billion worth of Ethereum from exchanges suggest a shift towards long-term holding by investors, potentially indicating confidence in the cryptocurrency's future. Overall, these developments could contribute to a positive market trend for Ethereum, with increased institutional interest and technological advancements driving growth in the cryptocurrency's value.

On November 20, Bitcoin's average daily transaction fee reached $10.34, while Ethereum's average fee stood at $8.43.\n\nThe upswing in Bitcoin transaction fees is a result of heightened activity surrounding the Ordinals Protocol, which enables the creation of NFT-like assets and BRC-20 tokens on the Bitcoin network. After a period of relative dormancy in late September to October, Ordinals-based assets experienced a significant surge in late October, according to Dune Analytics.\n\nSince October 24, over 6 million Ordinal assets have been generated, leading to the redistribution of more than 800 BTC in fees (equivalent to $30 million) to the network. The momentum further escalated when ORDI, the second-largest BRC-20 token by market capitalization, was listed on Binance on November 7.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing volatility with fluctuating open prices, high transaction activity, and mixed sentiment among traders indicated by the MACD signal. The news analyst report, on the other hand, highlights positive developments such as the interest in Ethereum ETFs by traditional finance giants like BlackRock and the launch of Nocturne protocol, suggesting a bullish sentiment towards Ethereum.

Considering the reflection analyst report, it is evident that a balanced approach considering both on-chain analysis and news sentiment has been effective in making profitable decisions. The conflicting signals from on-chain indicators and news reports indicate short-term uncertainty in the market trends. Therefore, a slightly conservative trading approach focusing on long-term strategies and effective risk management is recommended to capitalize on potential price appreciation in the future.

In conclusion, the overall market trend for Ethereum appears to be positive in the long term, despite short-term volatility. Therefore, I would take a slightly bullish stance with a trading action of 0.5, reflecting moderate confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately for long-term gains.
ACTION:
0.5
DAILY RETURN:
0.0014725677831657347
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is experiencing fluctuations in price and transaction volume, with mixed signals from indicators such as the MACD signal. The news analyst report highlights positive developments in the Ethereum ecosystem, including increased institutional interest and technological advancements. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a balanced approach considering both on-chain analysis and news sentiment, with a focus on long-term growth prospects and effective risk management.

Taking into account the information from all three reports, it is evident that while there may be short-term uncertainty in the market due to conflicting signals, the overall trend for Ethereum appears to be positive. The growing interest from institutional investors, advancements in the Ethereum ecosystem, and the shift towards long-term holding by investors indicate confidence in the cryptocurrency's future potential.

Therefore, it is advisable to adopt a slightly conservative trading approach focusing on long-term strategies and risk management to capitalize on potential price appreciation in the future. With this in mind, my trading action would be to buy ETH with a confidence level of 0.7, reflecting my belief in the positive long-term trend for Ethereum and my strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.
ACTION:

DAILY RETURN:
0.022355822278256055
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is experiencing fluctuations in price and transaction metrics, with mixed signals from indicators like the MACD signal. The news analyst report highlights a potential for short-term corrections due to selling by crypto whales, but also points towards a long-term bullish movement with the consolidation of Ethereum's price within an ascending triangle pattern. The election of a Bitcoin-supporting president in Argentina has also contributed to positive momentum in the cryptocurrency market.

Taking into account the reflection analyst report, which emphasizes a balanced approach considering both on-chain analysis and news sentiment, it is evident that a slightly conservative trading approach focusing on long-term strategies and risk management is warranted in the current market conditions. This approach aligns with the positive long-term outlook for Ethereum and the potential for price appreciation in the future.

Therefore, based on the synthesized reports, the clear market trend for ETH appears to be uncertain in the short term but bullish in the long term. As an experienced trader looking to maximize overall profit and manage risk appropriately, I would take a slightly conservative approach and focus on long-term strategies. My trading action would be to buy ETH with a confidence level of 0.7, indicating a moderate level of confidence in the long-term bullish movement of the market.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum (ETH) has been a focal point for crypto enthusiasts and investors alike, and its latest chart is a pivotal moment for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. As ETH approaches a well-known resistance level that has stymied its progress multiple times in the past, the crypto community is watching with bated breath to see if this test will result in a definitive breakthrough.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe resistance level in question has acted like a ceiling for Ethereum's price, capping its upward momentum on several occasions. Now, as ETH inches closer to this barrier once again, the stakes are high. A successful break above this level could confirm a bullish trend, potentially propelling the price to new highs.\n\nTechnical analysis suggests that if Ethereum manages to sustain a breakout above this resistance, we could witness an accelerated move toward the next major psychological level. The key will be a strong closing above the resistance on significant volume, which would likely attract more buyers into the market, further fueling the upward trajectory.\n\nAn interesting aspect to consider is the market's reaction to recent news events, such as the departure of Changpeng Zhao (CZ) from Binance. Contrary to some expectations, CZ's stepping down has not had a detrimental impact on the market. Instead, it may have alleviated some regulatory concerns, removing a potential risk factor and possibly contributing to a healthier market environment for major assets like Ethereum.\n\nThe Fibonacci extension levels and previous high points could serve as markers for where the price might head. Conversely, if Ethereum fails to break through, it may retest lower support levels, but the overall trend still appears to be leaning toward the positive, given the recent market resilience."}, {'id': 29, 'time': 'Wed, 22 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Movement Labs announces M2, the first Move VM-based L2 for Ethereum with Celestia modular data availability - Yahoo Finance', 'content': "New York, New York --News Direct-- Movement Labs\n\nMovement Labs has announced its plans to launch M2, the first Move Virtual Machine L2 for Ethereum, scaled with Celestia as modular DA.

This integration marks a strategic move for Shiba Inu, allowing the wallet's expansive user base of 5 million to access the Shibarium blockchain seamlessly.\n\nThe announcement highlights Atomic Wallet's newfound support for Shibarium-native cryptocurrencies, including SHIB, LEASH, and BONE. Since its launch in August, Shibarium has rapidly gained adoption, processing nearly 3.5 million transactions within its initial 90 days.\n\nFollowing the news of the integration, the market responded with a notable surge in the price of Shiba Inu.

On November 9, ETH was trading at $1,884.20. However, post-announcement, ETH soared by 10% to $2,018.66 as of November 22.\n\nPer ETH price prediction, Ethereum's future appears promising.\n\nThis optimistic outlook is grounded in anticipating an upcoming bull run and the potential approval of an Ethereum ETF.\n\nRebel Satoshi: A New Meme Coin Aiming for the $100 Market Cap\n\nRebel Satoshi (RBLZ) has emerged as more than just a meme coin; it's a passionate force aiming to disrupt the status quo and achieve a remarkable $100 million market capitalization. As crypto enthusiasts seek the next hidden gem, Rebel Satoshi positions itself as a unique blend of playfulness, purpose, and the potential for substantial returns.\n\nAt its core, Rebel Satoshi represents a movement, a call to rebellion against centralized systems and the entrenched elite. Inspired by historical figures like Satoshi Nakamoto and Guy Fawkes, Rebel Satoshi carries the torch of defiance and unity.\n\nThe $RBLZ token, an ERC-20 standard asset, becomes the symbolic embodiment of this mission, signifying unity against the established norms in the crypto space.\n\nKey features of $RBLZ include staking rewards, deflationary characteristics, meme coin status, a limited collection of 9,999 rare and exclusive NFTs, and governance within the Rebel Satoshi ecosystem.\n\nCurrently in the Early Bid Round of its public presale with a price of $0.010, the company says that $RBLZ is poised to list on exchanges at $0.025.\n\nFor the latest updates and more information, be sure to visit the official Rebel Satoshi Presale Website or contact Rebel Red via Telegram\n\nThis post was authored by an external contributor and does not represent Benzinga's opinions and has not been edited for content.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights positive developments in the Ethereum ecosystem, particularly in Layer 2 solutions and DeFi space. These developments suggest a positive outlook for Ethereum and its associated projects, potentially leading to increased adoption and investment in the near future.

The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a balanced approach considering both on-chain analysis and news sentiment for making profitable decisions. It also stresses the significance of long-term strategies and effective risk management in navigating the market uncertainty.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is evident that while short-term market fluctuations and uncertainty exist, the overall trend for Ethereum appears positive in the long term due to the growing interest and development in the ecosystem. Therefore, it is advisable to prioritize long-term gains over short-term fluctuations and adopt a slightly conservative trading approach to maximize overall profit and manage risk appropriately.

Based on this analysis, I would take a trading action with a confidence level of 0.7, indicating a moderately positive outlook for the ETH market in the long term.

This strategic move, effective from Nov. 28, is part of Binance's efforts to address mounting legal challenges within the digital assets industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe affected pairs are directly associated with BUSD, a stablecoin developed in collaboration with Paxos. Isolated margin borrowing on these pairs will be suspended on Nov. 28, followed by the closure of auto-settled user positions and the cancellation of pending orders on Dec. 7.\n\nPressure rise\n\nThis decision follows allegations by the U.S. SEC, which previously classified BUSD as a security. In response, both Paxos and Binance promptly halted the further minting and circulation of the stablecoin. This reflects the ongoing adjustments made by crypto exchanges to comply with evolving regulatory frameworks.\n\nIn a parallel development, Changpeng Zhao, or CZ, the founder of Binance, has stepped down from his role. This decision is part of a broader agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice to settle criminal charges against the exchange. Richard Teng has been named as the new CEO in the midst of this transitional period.\n\nCZ's guilty plea earlier this week, related to charges of operating an unlicensed money transfer business, conspiracy and violating restrictions, resulted in a significant $4.3 billion fine for Binance. As the crypto space grapples with these regulatory challenges, the implications for the market are uncertain.\n\nThe delisting of major pairs and the leadership change at Binance underscore the growing regulatory pressures faced by crypto exchanges globally, highlighting a pivotal moment for the industry."}, {'id': 7, 'time': 'Thu, 23 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum, Litecoin and Solana Forecast: Key Price Movements and Predictions for Nov 23 - FX Empire', 'content': "English English Italiano Español Português Deutsch العربية Français\n\nImportant Disclaimers The content provided on the website includes general news and publications, our personal analysis and opinions, and contents provided by third parties, which are intended for educational and research purposes only.

It refers to the price level at which the total value of options (both calls and puts) expiring on a certain date will cause the maximum financial loss to the option holders. This concept is often used by traders to assess potential market movements as options near their expiration dates.\n\nWhat does it mean?\n\nWhen BTC options are set to expire, it means that the contracts, which give the holder the right but not the obligation to buy or sell Bitcoin at a predetermined price (the strike price) by a specified date (the expiration date), are reaching the end of their validity period.\n\n#Bitcoin options seem to have a major impact on $BTC price!\n\n\n\n💥 Call options are dominating the options market as Bitcoin prepares for a significant $3.8 billion options expiry.\n\n\n\nThis dominance could significantly impact BTC's price trajectory in the coming days. pic.twitter.com/SeFjoANJmw — Satoshi Club (@esatoshiclub) November 23, 2023\n\nOn the expiration date, these options must be either exercised or they will become worthless.

The solution offers enhanced performance, security, and scalability for the network.\n\nMovement Labs’ M2 Addresses Ethereum Scalability\n\nOn Tuesday, November 22, in a significant development for the Ethereum network, Movement Labs announced the launch of M2. The technology is the first Move Virtual Machine (VM) Layer Two (L2) solution, integrated with Celestia’s modular data availability.\n\nThis announcement marks a notable stride in addressing the longstanding scalability issues faced by Ethereum. Known for its diverse range of applications, Ethereum has often grappled with high transaction costs and slower processing times, presenting challenges to its scalability and efficiency.\n\nM2 promises a transformative solution to these challenges. It is engineered to enhance Ethereum’s transaction capacity substantially, with the capability of theoretically processing over 145,000 transactions per second. This efficiency is set to mitigate network congestion, high transaction fees, and slow processing times.\n\nThe core innovation of M2 lies in its integration of the Move VM, known for its robust security features. Moreover, the Move VM fosters a developer-friendly environment and Celestia’s modular data availability.\n\nThe influence of M2 extends beyond the Ethereum network. Movement Labs aims to foster a more interconnected blockchain environment by integrating with various blockchain networks and virtual machines. This effort enhances liquidity and accessibility across the broader blockchain spectrum.\n\nWhat Sets Move VM in M2 Apart\n\nM2’s integration of the Move Virtual Machine (VM) introduces advanced technical features tailored for enhanced smart contract functionality. Unlike traditional smart contract environments, the Move VM offers a unique resource model that treats assets as singular and uncopyable, reducing the risks of double-spending and accidental loss. This model is particularly advantageous for financial applications and NFTs, where asset integrity and authenticity are paramount.\n\nCelestia’s contribution to M2 through its modular data availability layer is another crucial aspect. This technology separates consensus from data availability, allowing for more flexible and scalable blockchain architectures. In M2, Celestia’s system enables the distribution and storage of data in a more efficient and less resource-intensive way.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nAdopting new technologies like M2 often comes with a learning curve for developers and users. Ensuring widespread adoption may require significant community engagement, education, and support efforts.\n\nM2 is part of a broader landscape of Layer Two solutions being developed for Ethereum. These alternative solutions with unique features and approaches contribute to a diverse ecosystem.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nFor the broader blockchain community, M2’s launch is a testament to the ongoing innovation and collaboration within the space. It highlights the potential of new technologies to address fundamental challenges and opens up new possibilities for blockchain applications and services\n\nRead more about L2 solutions for Ethereum:\n\nTypes of Layer 2: Comparing Different Ethereum Scaling Solutions\n\n\n\nRead more about Binance’s settlement with US authorities:\n\nBinance Set to Thrive Post $4.3B Settlement: Analysts'}]

"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the Ethereum market is currently showing mixed signals with fluctuating indicators such as total gas used, total value transferred, and average gas price. The market trend appears uncertain and potentially volatile in the short term, as indicated by the MACD signal switching between sell and buy.

The news analyst report highlights a growing interest and adoption of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, by major financial institutions. This increased acceptance of digital assets in traditional banking, coupled with the surge in Bitcoin transaction fees and innovation within the crypto space, may put pressure on the market trend for Ethereum as Bitcoin gains momentum.

In reflection of the reports, it is evident that a balanced approach considering both on-chain analysis and news sentiment has been effective in making profitable decisions. Long-term strategies and effective risk management have been key to successful outcomes, despite short-term market uncertainty.

Considering the mixed signals and uncertainty in the short term, a slightly conservative trading approach focusing on long-term strategies and risk management is warranted to maximize overall profit and manage risk appropriately. Therefore, I would recommend a trading action of 0.5, reflecting moderate confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to prioritize long-term gains over short-term fluctuations.

The recent data shows that the open price of ETH has been fluctuating between 1940.44 and 2065.94, with varying levels of total gas used, unique addresses, total value transferred, average gas price, successful transactions, total transactions, and MACD signal indicating a buy trend. Despite some volatility in these metrics, the overall trend appears to be bullish as the open price has been gradually increasing. The high total value transferred and successful transactions suggest a strong level of activity within the ETH market. Therefore, it is likely that the market will continue to trend upwards in the near future.
"""

NEWS ANALYST REPORT:
"""
The news articles suggest a mixed outlook for Ethereum (ETH) in the cryptocurrency market. On one hand, the delisting of major Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) pairs by Binance due to regulatory pressures and leadership changes may create uncertainty and potentially impact market sentiment negatively. On the other hand, the announcement of Movement Labs' M2, the first Move VM-based Layer Two (L2) solution for Ethereum, promising enhanced scalability and performance, could bring positive developments for the Ethereum network. Additionally, the expiration of over $6.5 billion in Bitcoin and Ethereum options may lead to heightened trading activity and potentially unpredictable price movements. Overall, the market trend for Ethereum may be influenced by regulatory challenges, technological advancements, and options expiration dynamics.

In reflecting on recent trading performance, it is evident that a balanced approach considering both on-chain analysis and news sentiment has been effective in making profitable decisions. Long-term strategies and effective risk management have been key to successful outcomes, despite short-term market uncertainty. The most successful outcomes were achieved when prioritizing long-term gains over short-term fluctuations and adopting a slightly conservative trading approach. Moving forward, it is important to continue monitoring key indicators such as open prices, total value transferred, successful transactions, and MACD signals, as well as staying informed on positive developments in the Ethereum ecosystem.

*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the overall trend for ETH is bullish, with the open price gradually increasing and strong activity levels in the market. The news analyst report presents a mixed outlook, with regulatory challenges and technological advancements potentially impacting market sentiment. However, the reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a balanced approach, prioritizing long-term gains over short-term fluctuations and adopting a slightly conservative trading strategy.

Considering all the reports, it is evident that a long-term strategy focused on monitoring key indicators and staying informed on positive developments in the Ethereum ecosystem is crucial for maximizing overall profit and managing risk appropriately. While short-term market uncertainty may exist due to regulatory challenges and options expiration dynamics, the bullish outlook for ETH in the long term suggests that a conservative trading approach is warranted.

Therefore, based on the synthesized reports, I would recommend taking a slightly conservative trading action with a confidence level of 0.5.

The pattern has a minimum of two candlesticks and consists of a mother bar (the first candlestick in the pattern) followed by one or more subsequent candles. The subsequent candle(s) must be completely inside the range of the mother bar, and each is called an "inside bar."\n\nA double, or triple inside bar can be more powerful than a single inside bar.

A lack of volume was contributing to weakness in the move, which may indicate further consolidation is needed, at least on smaller timeframes.\n\nThe consolidation on Bitcoin and Ethereum, which has taken place since Nov. 10, has helped to drop their relative strength index (RSI) down from overbought territory to under the 70% level. This indicates that Bitcoin and Ethereum could eventually rally further north if bullish volume continues to power the cryptos.\n\nBullish traders want to see big bullish volume come in and break Bitcoin and Ethereum up above Friday’s new high-of-day, which could accelerate upside momentum. Bearish traders want to see big bearish volume come in and drop Bitcoin and Ethereum down under the eight-day exponential moving average (EMA), which would negate the current upward trend.\n\nBitcoin has resistance above at $38,105 and at $39,600 and support below at $35,593 and at $31,862.\n\nIf Dogecoin closes Friday’s 24-hour trading session near its high-of-day price, the crypto will form a bullish Marubozu candlestick, which could indicate higher prices will come again on Saturday. When the crypto eventually prints a reversal candlestick, such as a doji or shooting star candlestick, it could indicate the local top has occurred.\n\nBearish traders want to see Dogecoin fall under the eight-day EMA, which could indicate the downtrend will continue and the local top has formed.\n\nDogecoin has resistance above at $0.083 and at 9 cents and support below at $0.075 and at the 7-cent mark.\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock'}, {'id': 3, 'time': 'Fri, 24 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'REAL-TOK: The Future of Real Estate Investment on the Ethereum blockchain - Yahoo Finance', 'content': "RAS AL KHAIMAH, UAE / ACCESSWIRE / November 24, 2023 / In recent years, the advent of blockchain technology has ushered in a radical shift in the financial and investment landscape.

After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the fundamental indicators for ETH are positive, with increasing open price, total gas used, unique addresses, and total value transferred. The high average gas price and successful transactions further support a bullish market trend. The news analyst report also reinforces this sentiment, highlighting the positive movements in the cryptocurrency market, particularly with Ethereum leading the way.

The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a balanced approach considering both on-chain analysis and news sentiment. It suggests prioritizing long-term gains over short-term fluctuations and adopting a slightly conservative trading strategy. Given the bullish market sentiment, positive developments in the Ethereum ecosystem, and potential for continued growth, a conservative trading approach is recommended to maximize overall profit and manage risk appropriately.

Considering the synthesized reports, the clear market trend for ETH appears to be bullish, with strong fundamentals and positive news sentiment supporting further price growth. Therefore, I would recommend a long-term strategy to capitalize on this trend and manage risk effectively. 

As a result, my trading action would be to buy ETH with a confidence level of 0.8, indicating a high level of confidence in the bullish market trend and a strategic decision to prioritize long-term gains over short-term fluctuations.

The whale wallet holdings have climbed 30.3% since November 21, 2022, based on Santiment data.

The nine month accumulation spree is therefore likely to strengthen ETH price uptrend. It represents increasing buying pressure from whales.\n\nAs seen in the Glassnode chart below, both whale address count and addresses with balance greater than 10,000 ETH observed a spike since November 14.\n\nEthereum whale address count and price\n\nThe asset rallied past a key resistance zone between $1,899 and $2,052, where 4.9 million ETH wallet addresses scooped up 41.35 million Ether tokens. At the time of writing, Ethereum price is $2,080.19. The altcoin faces minimal resistance, in the zone between $2,141 and $2,505.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nEthereum ICO participant, dormant for over three years, has recently transferred 20,000 ETH (valued at approximately $42.4 million) to various destinations, including a 10 ETH deposit to the Kraken exchange. This awakening of a crypto giant correlates with movements in the Ethereum market that could have broader implications.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis "whale," a term affectionately given to large-scale holders of cryptocurrency, originally acquired 100,000 ETH at the nascent stage of Ethereum\'s life, during the initial coin offering (ICO). With the ICO price around $0.31, the cost basis of this investment was a mere $31,000, a sum that pales in comparison to the current valuation of these assets.\n\nThe timing of such a move is critical. The Ethereum price chart shows the currency testing a resistance point, attempting to sustain its momentum above the $2,000 mark. The emergence of such a significant player, particularly one initiating transactions of this magnitude, could signal to the market a shift in sentiment or liquidity that may catalyze further price action.\n\nWhile the transfer of 20,000 ETH is substantial, the current Ethereum market cap is vast enough that such a transaction alone is unlikely to cause disruptive market waves. However, it does bring attention to the potential for large holders to move markets. Should this whale decide to liquidate a significant portion of their holdings, it could introduce a substantial amount of Ethereum into the market, potentially putting downward pressure on the price.\n\nConversely, if this whale were to lock in their holdings or disperse them in a way that suggests a long-term hold strategy, market confidence could be reinforced, possibly driving prices upward. The deposit to Kraken might be an initial step toward liquidity, but it does not necessarily predict a major sell-off.'}, {'id': 7, 'time': 'Sat, 25 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum Sets Record With 94,000 New Users – Will it Drive ETH Price to $2,500? - FX Empire', 'content': "English English Italiano Español Português Deutsch العربية Français\n\nImportant Disclaimers The content provided on the website includes general news and publications, our personal analysis and opinions, and contents provided by third parties, which are intended for educational and research purposes only.

Revenues are projected to reach US $37.9B in 2023, although these digital currencies are often associated with volatility and uncertainty. Multiple blockchain platforms are there in the crypto market offering different currencies. However, the two cryptocurrencies that have gained the limelight over the years are Ethereum and Cardano. Both of them rank among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. This is not the only reason to invest in cryptos. This article will discuss similarities and key differences between Ethereum and Cardano– the two major cryptocurrencies, so you can make an informed investment decision.\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum and Cardano Ethereum in Brief Ethereum is a network of computers across the globe that follows the Ethereum protocol. It is a community-run technology that operates on blockchain to enable smart contracts and crypto trading. It is one of the best altcoins to invest your money in. Ethereum’s History and Vision Ethereum was created by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 but gained public awareness in 2014 after the Bitcoin Conference in Miami, Florida. It promotes itself as a peer-to-peer network that can be used by anyone interested in coordinating globally, creating organizations, building apps, and sharing values. Ethereum cryptocurrency, Ether, can be used for digital global payments. Cardano in Brief Cardano defines itself as the first blockchain platform to be developed through peer-reviewed research. It offers unparalleled security to its users and helps them ease transactions and exchanges & provides a system for organizations to grow. It works on the famous Proof-of-stake model (PoS), with a distinctive two-layer structure. Cardano’s History and Vision Cardano was developed by Charles Hoskinson and Jeremy Wood in 2017. Charles was one of the co-founders of Ethereum. During its launch, this highly valued cryptocurrency created 31 billion tokens. It also raised $60M+ during the initial coin offering in 2017. Cardano’s core vision is to disrupt the way blockchains reach consensus so they utilize a proof-of-stake called Ouroboros to be the most environmentally sustainable blockchain platform.\n\nEthereum vs Cardano: Key Parameters for Comparison The key differences between Ethereum and Cardano blockchain platforms lie in their credibility, ability to process high-volume transactions, and other parameters. Here is a comparative analysis between the two. Points of Difference Cardano Ethereum Token The supply of Cardano cannot exceed the maximum cap set at 45 billion coins. Ethereum has not set any upper restrictions on token supply. In contrast, its supply is set to increase at a fixed rate of 4.5% annually. Transaction Speed Cardano provides a transaction speed of approximately 250 per second. The transaction speed lies between 15 seconds to 5 minutes for Ethereum. Transaction Fees The transaction fee stands at 0.16 USD. The average transaction fee is approximately 1.164 USD. Nodes Cardano also operates on three nodes that take care of crypto transactions, help participate in blockchain governance, and send information between mCore nodes and the public internet. Ethereum works on three popular nodes to run its operations smoothly. These nodes include light, full, and archive nodes. Each node has its function ranging from ensuring accuracy to containing transaction data and history from previous blocks. Scalability Cardano is more flexible than Ethereum and can handle more transaction volumes. Ethereum cannot handle more transactions and the system faces a lag when more investors use the platform at the same time.\n\nFuture Outlook: Which Altcoin is a Better Investment? Whether to invest your money in Ethereum vs Cardano depends on your investment preferences and risk appetite. However, crypto experts believe that investing in Ethereum is more beneficial because of the support it gets from its developer community and large ecosystem. In contrast, investment in Cardano can go high for long-term acquisitions as it is growing in emerging markets. The popularity of this crypto depends on the support it is getting in from its growing user base. However, you need to wait a while to see how it will impact the growth and prices of Cardano.\n\nConclusion Investment in cryptocurrencies might be risky because of market volatility. However, having proper knowledge of different currencies might help you make a better decision. If you are looking to park your funds in the top cryptos, understanding the Ethereum vs Cardano differences helps you learn which crypto is suitable for your investment.'}]

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
The recent surge in Ethereum whale activity, with large wallet investors accumulating significant amounts of ETH, suggests a bullish outlook for the cryptocurrency. This accumulation, along with the creation of a large number of new Ethereum wallets, indicates strong buying pressure and potential price gains for ETH. Additionally, the awakening of a dormant Ethereum whale who transferred a substantial amount of ETH could signal a shift in market sentiment. However, recent hacks draining millions of dollars worth of altcoins from firms linked to Justin Sun may introduce some uncertainty and downward pressure on the market. Overall, the increased whale activity and positive price momentum could drive Ethereum towards new yearly highs, but caution is advised due to potential market disruptions from recent hacks.

The plan to redesign the Staking service came as soon as Ethereum transitioned from its Proof-of-Work (PoW) system to PoS.\n\nThough the SEC has not flagged the protocol in this regard, Vitalik Buterin’s proposition to decentralize the offering could make it less susceptible to falling under the regulator’s radar.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nCardano Founder and Community’s Position\n\nDesigned as an Ethereum killer with a mission to help cut on cost and speed of transactions, Charles Hoskinson takes every opportunity to sing Cardano’s praises.\n\nNotably, his simple response to Vitalik Buterin’s proposition reads: “No worries, Ethereum 3 will have it all sorted.”\n\nEthereum 1 is generally denoted as the PoW era and Ethereum 2.0 is the current stage with a PoS consensus mechanism.

Discover SCENE\n\nRecently announced Ethereum layer-2 scaling network Blast, led by the founder of top NFT marketplace Blur, has pulled in over half a billion dollars worth of locked funds from users seeking yield and rewards—but also faced substantial criticism over its rollout. And now early investor Paradigm has joined the list of parties with issues over the launch.\n\nOn Sunday, Paradigm Head of Research and General Partner Dan Robinson shared a post on X (aka Twitter) that took Blast’s launch to task, attributing his comments to “we at Paradigm,” suggesting it conveyed the prominent crypto-centric venture capital firm’s stance.\n\n“There are a lot of components of Blast that I’m excited about and would be interested in engaging with people on,” Robinson wrote. “That said, we at Paradigm think the announcement this week crossed lines in both messaging and execution.”\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n“For example, we don’t agree with the decision to launch the bridge before the L2, or not to allow withdrawals for three months, since we think it sets a bad precedent for other projects,” he continued. “We also think much of the marketing cheapens the work of a serious team.”\n\nThere are a lot of components of Blast that I’m excited about and would be interested in engaging with people on. That said, we at Paradigm think the announcement this week crossed lines in both messaging and execution. For example, we don’t agree with the decision to launch the… — Dan Robinson (@danrobinson) November 26, 2023\n\nBlast is billed as an Ethereum layer-2 network that offers “native yield for Ethereum and stablecoins,” letting users stake (or lock up) their funds in the network to earn an interest-like return.\n\nThe network also promises Blur-like “rewards” ahead for users, enticing early adopters to lock up their funds ahead of a potential airdrop ahead. Blur has already awarded hundreds of millions of dollars worth of its BLUR token to NFT traders, catapulting the marketplace ahead of former leader OpenSea in the process, and that historical example may be enticing for crypto users.\n\nHowever, while users have been excitedly locking up their funds ahead of Blast’s network launch in 2024—bringing Blast’s total value locked (TVL) to about $535 million at present, per data from DeFi Llama—the team has also faced significant criticism in the process.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEssentially, early users are locking their funds into a bridge that will eventually connect from Ethereum to Blast—but the Blast network isn’t actually live yet. And those funds cannot be withdrawn until the expected mainnet rollout in February, drawing security concerns due to the industry’s history of network bridges being exploited for vast sums of crypto. Some traders and industry builders have also called Blast a Ponzi scheme, given its rewards and referral model.\n\nBlast and Blur co-founder Tieshun “Pacman” Roquerre has rebuked such complaints, writing in a Twitter thread on Friday that there were “a number of misunderstandings” around Blast and attempting to address them.\n\n1/ There's a meme going around that Blast is a ponzi. The yield that Blast provides users can feel too good to be true, so this meme is understandable. But to put it simply, the yield Blast provides comes (initially) from Lido and MakerDAO. Lido yield comes from ETH staking… — Pacman | Blur + Blast (@PacmanBlur) November 24, 2023\n\nHe also said Friday that Paradigm—which was one of the investors in Blast’s $20 million seed round—had no role in Blast’s rollout plans. In fact, Pacman revealed then that Paradigm asked the Blast team to “make changes” to the launch and that Blast was considering them, but that it would ultimately make any decisions in-house.\n\nRobinson on Sunday praised Pacman and his team for the launch of Blur, which disrupted the NFT market and provided substantial rewards to users in the process. However, Robinson ultimately said that Paradigm and Blast weren’t aligned on certain elements of the rollout, and he felt a need on Paradigm’s behalf to try and advocate for “best practices” in the industry.\n\n“We’ve been discussing our concerns with the team and appreciate their willingness to engage with us, but there are still many points of disagreement,” Robinson wrote. “We invest in strong, independent founders who we don’t always agree with. But we understand that people may look to us to set an example on best practices in crypto.”\n\n“We don’t endorse these kinds of tactics and take our responsibility in the ecosystem seriously,” Robinson concluded.\n\nDecrypt reached out to both Paradigm and Blast for comment, but did not immediately hear back from either side.\n\nAD\n\nAD"}]

Today's chart of the day shows that defi activity might be picking up. That's according to a recent report by Blockchain Analytics firm. Ko. This chart shows the average gas fees on Ethereum hitting their highest levels in six months earlier in November as activity on the network increased. The Analytics platform says gas usage has been led by Unis swap where meet tokens like rock and surging tokens like RLB and link have registered significant volumes. Ko added that trading bots like banana gun which allow users to trade tokens with a relatively user friendly interface on the messaging platform has also consumed significant amounts of gas. While whale activity has also increased uni prices are seeing a bit of a jump today. Uni is at around $6.20 up almost 4%. That's it for today's chart of the day. I'm Jen Sani.

Aside from fees between 360% and 419% higher, transactions themselves would take nearly twice as long on average, Chainstack found.\n\nWait times would even stretch to 114 seconds compared to a block time of about 12 seconds (the minimum wait time if transactions are sent between blocks).\n\nRollups are designed to solve the blockchain trilemma — a tradeoff layer-1 networks must make between security, scalability and decentralization. Blockchains can only offer two of those elements at any one time, says Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who popularized the concept laid out in 2016.\n\nEthereum, for example, is built with security and decentralization in mind. But it’s not totally scalable — transaction fees generally rise alongside user activity and can grow exponentially at times of peak demand.\n\nWith rollups, Ethereum is able to offload some of the pressure. There are two popular rollup solutions today: Optimistic rollups and zero-knowledge (zk) rollups.\n\nOptimistic rollups, such as Arbitrum and Optimism, process transactions off-chain and then post the data of the transaction back onto Ethereum as “calldata.” ZK rollups, such as Polygon zkEVM and zkSync Era, post all data on-chain but use cryptography to validate whether transactions are accurate without revealing the information itself.\n\nUsage of rollups has grown considerably over the past two years, with Arbitrium and Optimism often together handling more daily transactions than Ethereum mainnet.\n\n“… it’s clear how roll-up transactions have gone from representing a minor fraction of the network’s activity in 2021 to playing a vital part in Ethereum’s functioning by 2023,” Chainstack wrote.\n\nThe report added that the growing number of transactions illustrated the crucial functioning of rollups to Ethereum’s overall network efficiency.\n\nAlthough, Ethereum gas fees (currently about $1 on average) have seen a constant uptrend between 2021 and 2023 despite the popularity of rollups. But Chainstack reasoned that L2 networks have still served as a necessary and useful counterbalance.\n\nDon’t miss the next big story – join our free daily newsletter.'}, {'id': 1, 'time': 'Mon, 27 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum Price Hints At Potential Correction, Buy The Dip? - NewsBTC', 'content': 'Ethereum price struggled above $2,100.

Bitcoin paved the way, and many altcoins followed, later surpassing it, especially recently from September, making explosive and parabolic rises.\n\nMeanwhile, the price of the largest altcoin – Ethereum, has been underperforming compared to many cryptocurrencies. It, too, saw a price appreciation but only 84% since the start of the year. Unlike many that have made new yearly highs, it stayed within its previous, completed in April of $2,150, and now, in November, it came just shy of it.\n\nFrom November 9, when it came to $2,124, we saw a choppy price action lasting 18 days. As the price struggles at these levels, is this an indication of a looming reversal?\n\nETH Price Analysis\n\nThe price of Ethereum fell to $920 on June 18 last year. This was the completion of the downtrend from the all-time high of $4,852, resulting in 82% depreciation. A recovery started as it did across the whole cryptocurrency market, but unlike many cryptocurrencies, the price of ETH didn’t make a lower low.\n\nInstead, it was on a continuous incline, initially coming to $2,000 on August 14 and later making a slightly higher high to around $2,150 on April 16, 2023. Its support level was ascending; the horizontal resistance around $2,100 formed an ascending flat triangle.\n\nThe last rise from October 11 was made from this ascending support at $1,530, but the price still found resistance at the same horizontal area instead of making another higher high. The flat zone proved to be strong, but if this whole ascending triangle structure was the starting formation of the larger bull phase, can we see a breakout to the upside?\n\nETH Price Prediction\n\nLooking at the wave structure, there is a possibility that the whole ascending triangle is the starting impulse wave from the next bull phase for Ethereum’s price. This is known as the leading diagonal pattern in the Elliott Wave theory.\n\nIf this count is correct, the price increase ended for now on the last interaction with the horizontal resistance around the $2,100 area. In that case, we are ready to see a first bull market correction that will establish the first macro higher low.\n\nMeasuring with the Fibonacci retracement tool at its optimal level, we have a price target of $1,380. This corresponds to the horizontal support area, but the price can fall even further until this possibility is invalidated.\n\nAll in all, the price of Ethereum has most likely ended its last uptrend from mid-October and will now make a reversal. If this turns out to be the correction we are expecting, it would mark the completion of the first two bullish waves and indicate the start of a larger uptrend at the beginning of 2024.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPlease note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.

This downturn in Ether’s performance comes as the broader cryptocurrency market sentiment deteriorates.\n\nIt’s possible that recent developments, such as the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) signaling potential severe repercussions for Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, have contributed to the negative outlook.\n\nIn a filing on Nov. 22 to a Seattle federal court, U.S. prosecutors sought a review and reversal of a judge’s decision permitting CZ to return to the United Arab Emirates on a $175 million bond. The DOJ argues that Zhao poses an “unacceptable risk of flight and nonappearance” if allowed to leave the U.S. pending sentencing.\n\nEthereum DApps and DeFi face new challenges\n\nThe recent $46 million KyberSwap exploit on Nov. 23 has further dampened demand for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications on Ethereum. Despite being previously audited by security experts, including a couple in 2023, the incident has heightened concerns about the safety of the overall DeFi industry. Fortunately for investors, the attacker expressed willingness to return some of the funds, yet the event underscored the sector’s vulnerabilities.\n\nAdditionally, investor confidence was shaken by a Nov. 21 blog post from Tether, the firm behind the Tether (USDT) stablecoin. The post announced the U.S. Secret Service’s recent integration into its platform and hinted at forthcoming involvement from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\nThe lack of details in the announcement has led to speculation about an increasingly stringent regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies, especially with Binance facing heightened scrutiny and Tether’s closer collaboration with authorities. These factors are likely contributing to Ether’s underperformance, with various on-chain and market indicators suggesting a decline in ETH demand.\n\nInvestors become cautious as ETH on-chain data reflects weakness\n\nEther exchange-traded products (ETPs) saw only $34 million of inflows in the last week, according to CoinShares. This figure is a modest 10% of the inflow seen by equivalent Bitcoin (BTC) crypto funds during the same period. The competition between the two assets for spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval in the U.S. makes this disparity particularly noteworthy.\n\nMoreover, the current seven-day average annualized yield of 4.2% on Ethereum staking is less appealing than the 5.25% return offered by traditional fixed-income assets. This disparity led to significant outflows of $349 million from Ethereum staking in the previous week, as reported by StakingRewards.\n\nHigh transaction costs continue to be challenging, with the seven-day average transaction fee at $7.40. This expense has adversely affected the demand for decentralized applications (DApps), leading to a 21.8% decline in DApps volume on the network in the last week, as per DappRadar.\n\nTop Ethereum Dapps by volume. Source: DappRadar\n\nNotably, while most Ethereum DeFi applications saw a significant drop in activity, competing chains like BNB Chain and Solana experienced an 11% increase and stable activity, respectively.\n\nRelated: Changpeng Zhao may not leave the US pending court review, says judge\n\nConsequently, Ethereum network protocol fees have decreased for four consecutive days, amounting to $5.4 million on Nov. 26, compared to a daily average of $10 million between Nov. 20 and Nov. 23, as reported by DefiLlama. This trend could potentially create a negative spiral, driving users toward competing chains in search of better yields.\n\nEther’s current price pullback on Nov. 27 reflects growing concerns over regulatory challenges and the potential impact of exploits and sanctions on stablecoins used in DeFi applications.\n\nThe increasing involvement of the DOJ and FBI with Tether elevates the systemic risk for liquidity pools and the entire oracle-based pricing mechanism. While there’s no immediate cause for panic selling or fears of a drop to $1,800, the lackluster demand from institutional investors, as indicated by ETP flows, is certainly not a positive sign for the market.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

"But a superintelligent AI, if it decides to turn against us, may well leave no survivors and end humanity for good," he remarked, worrying that not even Mars could be a refuge.\n\nHe advocated for a future that preserves “human” traits and agency, stating, “If we want a future that is both superintelligent and ‘human’—one where human beings are not just pets, but actually retain meaningful agency over the world—then it feels like something like this is the most natural option.”\n\nSee More: Dogecoin HODLERs Are Beating Shiba Inu With 57% Landing In Profits, IntoTheBlock Data Reveals\n\nWhy It Matters: Addressing concerns about the future evolution of Ethereum during an AMA on Farcaster, Buterin disclosed that two of his greatest fears were the stagnation of cryptocurrency and the potential dangers associated with AI.\n\nWhen questioned on what occupies his thoughts frequently, the influential developer cited, “AI-related issues,” specifically existential risks derived from it.\n\nPrice Action: At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $1,999, down 1.12% in the last 24 hours according to Benzinga Pro.\n\nRead Next: Here’s How Much You Should Invest In Shiba Inu Today For A $1M Payday If SHIB Hits 1 Cent?\n\nPhoto by TechCrunch on Flickr'}, {'id': 11, 'time': 'Tue, 28 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Wake: New Open-Source Tooling on Ethereum to Stop Bugs - Yahoo Finance', 'content': 'Wake\n\nPrague, Czech Republic, Nov. 28, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Quicktake:\n\n\n\nWake is a Python-based Solidity development and testing framework with built-in vulnerability detectors. It was used in audits by Ackee Blockchain and is now being open-sourced and free to use for everyone.\n\nSecurity experts are on high alert, as history shows that hack risks increase as market activity rises. Open-source tooling like Wake empowers application builders to conduct swift and thorough checks for code vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\nBattlefield-proven audit tooling goes open-source\n\nAckee Blockchain, a team of smart contract auditors and creators of community tools, introduces Wake, a Python-based development and testing framework for Solidity and cross-chain fuzzing with a proven track record of stopping bugs.\n\nWake’s features include a development and testing framework, a fuzzer, vulnerability detectors, and printers.\n\nWake was previously used in smart contract audits performed by Ackee Blockchain for IPOR, Axelar, and Solady and helped the auditors find critical, high, and medium bugs. The firm has announced it will make the tool open-source to contribute to a safer blockchain space.\n\n\n\nSecurity experts on alert as market activity rises\n\nAs DeFi activity rises, hackers see more lucrative targets and grow emboldened. In bull markets, projects often rush to ship product updates, creating a high demand for experienced smart contract auditor services. In the peak of the 2021 bull market, projects were typically quoted three month+ audit wait times by reputable firms. They then face a difficult decision to delay launches amid frenzied “land grabs” or launch with hastily conducted audits, increasing security risks.\n\nAfter a week when crypto funds saw their highest inflows since the 2021 bull market and DeFi volumes rose by approximately 50%, security experts are on higher alert. Wake’s release is timely - it allows application developers to expertly test the smart contracts of DEXs or any protocol that plugs into their service or upon which they are reliant.\n\n\n\nStory continues\n\nDesigned to generate fewer false positives and reduce manual audit time\n\nOn top of being the testing framework, Wake allows users to run static analysis. It has a set of ready-to-use high-precision vulnerability and code quality detectors and ready-to-use printers for extracting and pretty-printing useful information such as smart contract control flow and inheritance graphs.\n\n“A common problem of static analysis tools is a high false-positives ratio requiring extra manual investigation time. Our philosophy is to include only the most precise detectors and reduce all noise that creates extra overhead,” - Josef Gattermayer, CEO and co-founder of Ackee Blockchain.\n\nWake underwent performance testing with other frameworks, namely Hardhat, Brownie, and Ape, on three different development chains – Anvil, Ganache, and Hardhat. Wake proved to be the fastest Python framework.\n\nThe new release of Wake allows the customization of detectors and printers. It also allows third parties to create and implement their custom printers and detectors. The newest version also introduced Github action for automatically executing detectors in a pipeline. “The low false-positive rate, fastest industry test execution, and ready-made GitHub action make Wake an ideal candidate for CI/CD integration in every project” - Josef Gattermayer, CEO and co-founder of Ackee Blockchain.\n\nWake powers Tools for Solidity, a popular Visual Studio Code Solidity extension that does syntax highlighting and detections from Wake vulnerability and code quality detectors and provides instant feedback to the developers using the extension access to all references of a symbol across the whole project.\n\n\n\nAbout Wake\n\nWake is a Python-based development and testing framework for Solidity and cross-chain fuzzing with a proven track record of stopping bugs created by Ackee Blockchain, which became possible thanks to a grant Ackee Blockchain received from Coinbase in 2022.\n\nTo learn more, please visit getwake.io.\n\nWebsite | Twitter | Telegram\n\n\n\nAbout Ackee Blockchain\n\nAckee Blockchain is a team of security researchers auditing top-tier protocols: Safe, 1inch, Axelar, LayerZero, Trader Joe, or CoW Protocol.\n\nAckee Blockchain is backed by the largest VC fund focused on blockchain and DeFi in Europe, RockawayX, and received grants from the Ethereum Foundation, Tezos Foundation, Coinbase, and Solana Foundation.\n\nAckee Blockchain’s mission is to build a stronger blockchain community by sharing knowledge: the team runs a free certification course School of Solidity, School of Solana and teaches at the Czech Technical University in Prague. This mission is also fulfilled in initiatives such as the ERC-7512 draft, developing the Wake toolkit, or the open-source fuzzer for Solana.\n\nWebsite | Twitter\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, or intended as investment ...'}]

According to Buterin, AI could potentially outsmart humans and take over as the dominant power on Earth. He cautions that if a superintelligent AI saw humans as a threat, it could lead to disastrous consequences. Even though these issues seem that they will be a pain in the neck for our descendants in the distant future, one should keep in mind the rapid pace at which AI is advancing. Additionally, we still have not figured out how to program these super intelligent beings to live safely alongside humans. Buterin also challenges his readers to imagine living in a society ruled by artificial intelligence, referring to Iain Banks\'s Culture series, where humans coexist with powerful AI. In this imagined future, humans are offered longevity, health and entertainment, but at the cost of control over AI.\n\nElon Musk\'s X secures new payment license in key US state\n\nOn Nov. 27, Elon Musk-owned X platform achieved an important milestone on its path to becoming the "everything app"; it secured a money transmitter license from South Dakota regulators. The license enables the company to facilitate seamless cross-border money transfers. In total, X can provide money transmitting services in 10 American states: Arizona, Georgia, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and, newly added, South Dakota.

While the long-term implications could be very positive if history repeats itself, there are reasons to temper expectations.\n\nA weekly golden cross has formed | ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nEthereum Golden Cross And A Possible Target For New ATHs\n\n1W ETHUSD has formed a golden cross for the second time in 2023. A golden cross is a buy signal in moving average-based trading systems. It suggests that the trend is moving in an upward direction and because trends tend to persist, this is notable.\n\nThe golden signal occurs when a shorter-term moving average (the 50-week MA) crosses through a longer-term moving average (the 200-week MA) from below. A death cross forms when the opposite happens.\n\nThe last confirmed golden cross for Ethereum in December 2020 preceded a massive 600% rally over the next year to the asset’s all-time high near $4,900. A repeat move of similar magnitude this time would put Ethereum above $12,000—over six times today’s price of around $2,000.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that not all golden crosses lead to the anticipated upside. In 2023 alone, 1W ETHUSD has death crossed and golden crossed twice now, demonstrating how moving average-based systems are prone to whipsaw without an established trend to follow.\n\nAbove 20 on the ADX confirms the trend | ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nAn Uptrend Or More Whipsaw? How The ADX Confirms Trends\n\nThe whipsawing death cross and golden cross price action on the Ethereum 1-week chart failed to generate follow-through in either direction. So how can we be sure that this isn’t yet another premature crossover?\n\nThis is where the Average Directional Index (ADX) comes in when gauging the validity of moving average crosses. The ADX aims to measure trend strength, typically on a scale of 0 to 100.\n\nAs the 1-week ADX edges up from below 20, it confirms growing momentum that reduces the odds of more whipsawing price action. Traders often use such ADX readings to confirm golden/death crosses and enter only the most high-conviction signals.\n\nThe 1W ETHUSD Average Directional Index isn’t yet above 20, but is approaching this key level. Above it, it gives the golden cross much more validity.\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

This will enable developers to port Ethereum-based contracts over to the network and use them on it.\n\nTo add this feature, Sei V2 will incorporate Geth, a Go implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Geth is the most widely used Ethereum client software.\n\nSei Labs told The Block that it has developed a specialized interface to facilitate interaction of Sei\'s existing smart contracts component (based on CosmWasm technology) with the EVM component. CosmWasm is a custom Cosmos SDK module that allows chains to operate smart contracts in the Cosmos ecosystem. With V2, the team will enable an efficient integration of EVM support into the Sei network.\n\n"Sei V2 is an additive change. All of the existing components like CosmWasm will continue to exist. Since this is a proposed chain modification, the different virtual machines will also be able to interact with each other, allowing for Sei V2 to be the first network where EVM and Cosmwasm contracts are able to call each other," Jay Jog, co-founder at Sei Labs told The Block.\n\nExpanding on Sei V1\n\nSei has been operational on the mainnet beta since the V1 launch in August, offering support for Cosmos smart contracts written in Rust. With Sei V2, the team behind it aims to broaden its appeal to a wider range of developers. The development will add a fully parallelized EVM-compatible layer with sub-second finality (the speed at which transactions are confirmed).\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block\'s Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nIn addition to EVM support, Sei V2 introduces SeiDB, a data structure that purports to improve the platform’s storage layer. According to the team, SeiDB will prevent state bloat — where the network becomes excessively data heavy — and simplify the state synchronization process for new nodes. The objective here is to boost the overall performance and scalability of the Sei blockchain.\n\nThe Sei V2 upgrade is currently nearing completion from a code development perspective and is undergoing a rigorous audit process to ensure its security. It is scheduled to be released on a public testnet in the first quarter of 2024, with the mainnet deployment expected in the first half of the year.\n\nWhat is Sei?\n\nSei is a Cosmos SDK-based proof-of-stake blockchain, designed to be optimized for trading with its ability to execute sub-second blocks. In April 2023, Sei Labs, the core developer of the network, raised $30 million in two strategic funding rounds from venture firms including Jump and Multicoin Capital.\n\nWith functionality that supports fast decentralized trading, Sei targets a specific niche where it competes with other Cosmos chains like Osmosis, Kava, Injective, Neutron and Kujira.'}, {'id': 0, 'time': 'Wed, 29 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Best Places to Buy Ethereum for 2024 - The Motley Fool', 'content': "What is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum was the first cryptocurrency to introduce smart contracts. A smart contract is a tiny piece of code that lives on the blockchain, and it's the technology behind the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry. A large proportion of decentralized applications are built on the Ethereum ecosystem, although Ethereum now has a lot of competitors that want to take some of its market share.\n\nWhere can you buy Ethereum?\n\nYou can buy Ethereum from almost any cryptocurrency platform. You can even buy Ethereum from some Bitcoin ATMs in the U.S. Let's look at the differences between apps, exchanges and brokers.\n\nCryptocurrency brokers: Several traditional stock brokers offer a limited selection of cryptocurrencies alongside their other products. These are a great option for people who want to add Ethereum to their investment portfolio without opening a new crypto exchange account. Be aware that most crypto brokers don't offer external wallets so it may not be easy to withdraw or deposit crypto assets.\n\nSeveral traditional stock brokers offer a limited selection of cryptocurrencies alongside their other products. These are a great option for people who want to add Ethereum to their investment portfolio without opening a new crypto exchange account. Be aware that most crypto brokers don't offer external wallets so it may not be easy to withdraw or deposit crypto assets. Cryptocurrency exchanges: These are the most common way to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, and plenty of exchanges offer lots of ways to deposit fiat currency (such as U.S. dollars), reasonable fees, and a sizable list of tradable coins. On the downside, these exchanges are not subject to the same regulations as stock brokers.\n\nThese are the most common way to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, and plenty of exchanges offer lots of ways to deposit fiat currency (such as U.S. dollars), reasonable fees, and a sizable list of tradable coins. On the downside, these exchanges are not subject to the same regulations as stock brokers. Cryptocurrency apps: Most cryptocurrency brokers and exchanges also have mobile apps to make it easy to trade on the go. You can also buy Ethereum using payment apps such as Venmo and Paypal.\n\nWhat to look for when buying Ethereum\n\nBuying Ethereum for the first time can be a little daunting. But there are a lot of excellent products out there, it's just a question of finding the right platform for you.\n\nHere are some key questions to help you find the best place to buy Ethereum.\n\n1. What fees will you have to pay?\n\nBroadly speaking, there are three types of fees to watch out for:\n\nDeposit fees\n\nTrading fees\n\nWithdrawal fees\n\nWe'll break these down in more detail below. Just be aware that fees are rarely standard across the various trading platforms. For example, you might find a cryptocurrency exchange that offers free trading but charges you a lot of money to withdraw your funds.\n\nDon't be afraid to open a couple of accounts and experiment. But don't deposit any money until you're comfortable with the fee structure.\n\n2. How will the platform secure your assets?\n\nCryptocurrency investment is an exciting world, but unfortunately it has attracted its fair share of bad actors. In addition to the risk of hacking, the collapse of FTX also demonstrated that we don't always know what an exchange is doing with your money. Simply put, cryptocurrency exchanges don't have the same investor protections and security as you'd find in banks and other financial institutions.\n\nIf a crypto exchange or broker is not transparent about its security systems, this should be a major red flag. Sometimes you'll read that a company doesn't want to disclose these details for security reasons, but that's misleading. There's plenty of information a trading platform can reveal without compromising its systems.\n\n3. Are there any sign-up bonuses?\n\nSome platforms offer sign-up bonuses for new investors. You might find a platform that gives you a small bonus when you start, or one that offers a bonus when you make a certain amount of trades or deposit a certain amount of money. While these are tempting, don't let them drive your decision-making. It may be a great tie breaker, but there's no point in signing up for the wrong exchange just because you want the bonus.\n\n4. Is it available in my country or state?\n\nSome cryptocurrency exchanges can't operate in the U.S., and only a handful are licensed to operate in every state. For example, New York has some of the strictest crypto exchange regulation and will actively pursue rule breakers. As such, it's good to check that the exchange you want to use is allowed to operate where you live.\n\n5. Does it have all the features you need?\n\nIf you're buying Ethereum for the first time, you'll want an easy-to-use platform with plenty of educational resources. If you prefer mobile apps to web browsers, look for an exchange with a good app.\n\nOther useful features include:\n\nThe ability to set up automatic monthly tr..."}]
