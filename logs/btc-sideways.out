Among these new-age assets, Bitcoin – the world's leading cryptocurrency – emerges as an intriguing option for those seeking an inflation hedge.\n\nBitcoin's design, characterized by its fixed supply of 21 million coins, safeguards it from the inflationary pressures that traditional currencies succumb to. By nature, Bitcoin cannot undergo dilution through inflation - a compelling factor that makes it enticing to discerning investors. Moreover, the decentralized architecture of Bitcoin disentangles it from any form of manipulation or control by central banks and governments. This intrinsic freedom lends an additional layer of security to investors wary of government interventions.\n\nHowever, the unique design of Bitcoin doesn't guarantee its viability as an inflation hedge in every circumstance. It's crucial to note that the value of Bitcoin is primarily driven by market demand and supply, with no tangible asset backing it up. Thus, the price can be volatile, experiencing dramatic rises and falls over short periods, even more so than traditional investments. For example, between late 2017 and early 2018, Bitcoin's price swung from nearly $20,000 down to just above $3,000. This level of volatility poses a risk for investors who may need to liquidate their holdings in times of market stress.\n\nWhen using Bitcoin as an inflation hedge, one must also consider its relatively short history compared to traditional investment vehicles like gold. With just over a decade in existence, Bitcoin's performance in a diverse range of economic scenarios is not entirely known. Its behavior during inflationary periods, in particular, remains largely untested. Given that inflation tends to occur over long timeframes, Bitcoin's longevity and stability in such conditions are yet to be fully evaluated.\n\nThe regulatory landscape surrounding cryptocurrencies is another critical factor in assessing Bitcoin's feasibility as an inflation hedge. Despite gaining wider acceptance, cryptocurrencies are still subjected to legal and regulatory uncertainties across different jurisdictions. There have been instances where governments, including China and India, have restricted or banned the use of cryptocurrencies, impacting their value and liquidity.\n\nThese factors do not undermine Bitcoin's potential but reflect the complexities and risks that come with investing in it. When considering Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, it is advisable to incorporate it as part of a diversified portfolio. By spreading investments across a range of asset types, investors can leverage Bitcoin's potential benefits while mitigating its risks.\n\nFurthermore, it's essential to keep in mind that hedging against inflation is a long-term strategy. Therefore, patience and discipline are key. Although Bitcoin's price may experience dramatic fluctuations in the short term, its overall trajectory since inception suggests a positive trend. Yet, investing in Bitcoin should not be based solely on historical performance, but rather, on thorough research and understanding of the asset and the broader cryptocurrency market.\n\nBitcoin has potential as an inflation hedge due to its fixed supply and decentralized nature. However, the inherent volatility, regulatory uncertainties, and relatively short historical record compared to traditional hedges add a level of risk. Thus, a careful, well-researched approach and diversification are crucial when considering Bitcoin as part of an inflation-hedging strategy.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc. and Nasdaq® is a registered trademark of Nasdaq, Inc.

*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
After reviewing the reports from the on-chain analyst, news analyst, and reflection analyst, it is evident that the market is showing signs of potential bullish trends. The on-chain analyst report highlights a high total value transferred, low average fee, and a buy trend indicated by the MACD signal. The news analyst report also supports this sentiment, citing positive market sentiment and the potential approval of a bitcoin ETF by BlackRock. However, the reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of monitoring market trends closely and adopting a more conservative trading approach to mitigate risks.

Considering the overall market outlook and the need for a cautious approach, it is advisable to focus on long-term strategies rather than short-term gains. By closely monitoring market trends, news developments, and technical indicators, traders can make informed decisions to maximize profitability while managing risks effectively.

In line with this strategic approach, I would recommend taking a slightly bullish stance with a trading action of 0.5. This indicates a moderate level of confidence in the potential bullish trend while also acknowledging the need for caution and risk management in the current market environment. By maintaining a balanced approach and staying informed, traders can position themselves for long-term success in the cryptocurrency market.

One of the bill’s main provisions is to fire Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler. The bill would remove Gensler from office and redistribute power between the SEC chair and commissioners. It would also add a sixth commissioner to the agency, disallow any party from holding a majority on the commission and create an executive director position. The SEC declined to comment on the matter.\n\nBlackRock applies for spot Bitcoin ETF — a US first if approved\n\nBlackRock, the world’s largest investment company, has filed an application for a Bitcoin spot exchange traded fund (ETF). It would be the first crypto spot ETF in the United States, if it receives approval. According to the filing, Coinbase Custody Trust Company would be the custodian of the fund and Bank of New York Mellon would custody its fiat. The SEC has not approved a spot Bitcoin ETF so far despite numerous applicants. The world’s first spot traded Bitcoin ETF was Canada’s Purpose Bitcoin ETF, set up in early 2021.\n\nBinance CEO Changpeng Zhao denies rumors of selling Bitcoin to bolster BNB\n\nBinance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has refuted accusations that Binance has been secretly selling Bitcoin (BTC) to artificially stabilize the price of its BNB token. The rumors have come from several market commentators in the past days, accusing the exchange of intentionally manipulating the market to artificially inflate the value of BNB. CZ said that Binance had not sold any of its BTC or BNB, adding that the crypto exchange still held “a bag” of FTX Token — the native token of the now-defunct crypto exchange FTX.\n\nSEC’s Gensler says BTC, ETH ‘not securities’ in a newly surfaced video\n\nA newly surfaced video from 2018 featuring Gary Gensler has made the rounds on social media, showing the now-chair of the U.S. securities regulator again stating that multiple cryptocurrencies are not securities. “Over 70% of the crypto market is Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash. Why did I name those four? They’re not securities,” Gensler says in the video, which is understood to come from a 2018 event hosted by Bloomberg for institutional investors. At the time, Gensler was a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The video contrasts with his more recent actions as the chair of the SEC.\n\nBinance\u200b.US hires former SEC enforcement official amid lawsuit\n\nFormer SEC enforcement official George Canellos has reportedly been hired by Binance.US as part of the legal team defending the company against allegations of operating as an unregistered securities exchange. In response to the SEC’s action on June 5, Binance.US announced the suspension of U.S. dollar deposits and the potential pausing of fiat withdrawals, citing “extremely aggressive and intimidating tactics” from regulators. On Twitter, a former SEC chief said the exchange is “clearly preparing for a criminal prosecution and continuing to hire the best defense attorneys in the world.”\n\nWinners and Losers\n\nAt the end of the week, Bitcoin (BTC) is at $26,349, Ether (ETH) at $1,716 and XRP at $0.47.

It also charged Coinbase, a public company and the biggest U.S. crypto business, with failing to register as a broker-dealer.\n\nThe government actions did not move the price of bitcoin much, nor did they crater Coinbase stock; traders and investors had been expecting the enforcement actions for months. And both firms vowed to fight the charges and remain operational. Binance “should not be the subject of an SEC enforcement action, let alone on an emergency basis,” the firm said in a statement. “We are very confident in the way we run our business—the same business we presented to the SEC in order for us to become a public company,” Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s chief legal officer, said in response.\n\nEven before the SEC announcements, crypto was in trouble. Dozens of firms had failed, millions of individual investors had plunged into the red or cashed out, and billions of dollars of institutional investment had moved on. Beset by long-standing problems of its own invention, the industry now faces not just a regulatory crisis but an existential one too: Is crypto down, or is it dead?\n\nIt is definitely down, written off by thousands of individual and institutional investors. The most obvious issue: scams. In the world of crypto, big firms are scams. Little firms are scams. Stable coins are scams; exchanges are scams; NFT schemes are scams; initial coin offerings are scams; tokens are scams. Firms run by self-proclaimed altruists are scams. Firms run by the shadiest dudes you can possibly imagine are scams. “There have been a lot of putatively decentralized Web3 companies that were really just three guys and a pair of servers in a pump-and-dump coin scheme,” Will Wilkinson, the head of policy at TBD, a bitcoin-focused subsidiary of the fintech giant Block, told me. And even simple, legitimate crypto activity remains prone to fraud. Hackers purloined nearly $4 billion of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies last year alone, according to the research group Chainalysis.\n\nThe industry also has a complexity problem. Fourteen years since the advent of bitcoin, people still struggle to comprehend how the blockchain works, what Web3 is, and what tokens and coins and NFTs are. Many folks also struggle to figure out how to buy crypto assets and manage their investments. (Why do you need a weird series of letters and numbers to secure your bitcoin, again?)\n\n“A mature market is one that shouldn’t make you afraid to put your money in. You shouldn’t be turning off a bunch of folks with greed and theft,” Yesha Yadav, an expert in financial-market regulation at Vanderbilt University’s law school, told me. “Equally, it should be one in which folks feel comfortable in understanding the technicalities.”\n\nWhat is the point of doing all of this, anyway? Boosters have for years described crypto as a revolutionary technology—disempowering central banks, empowering private individuals, and perhaps even ushering in an era of world peace. But revolutionary for whom and in what way? That’s hard to say. Most crypto users are just making speculative bets; most crypto firms are just making or facilitating speculative bets themselves. Crypto is a casino, for the most part, and one without the free drinks.\n\nThese digital assets are “pretty much only good for illegal activities, like money laundering, narco-terrorism, and tax evasion,” Dennis Kelleher, a co-founder of Better Markets, a nonprofit advocating for financial regulation, told me. “Is there social or public interest in enabling a financial product like that?”\n\nThen there are the volatility and the bubbles. Financial assets go up in price. They go down in price. This is their nature. But few things go up and down quite like crypto. NFTs came out of nowhere, sucked up billions of dollars, and collapsed. Initial coin offerings came out of nowhere, sucked up billions of dollars, and disappeared.\n\nEven bitcoin—the most stalwart and liquid part of the industry—still sees wild swings in price. Two years ago, the internet and the airwaves were awash with advertisements painting crypto as an investment for the brave, a down payment on the future. These ads targeted everyone, especially Black investors historically shunned by Main Street financial institutions. “I want to ensure that communities like the one I come from are not left behind,” LeBron James said, announcing a multiyear deal with Crypto.com. It was a pump-and-dump on a multibillion-dollar scale. “Dumb money” got in to get smart money out. Black money got in to get white money out. The price of bitcoin quintupled. Then it crumbled.\n\nWealthy investors might be able to tolerate these kinds of losses. High-risk investors might be able to tolerate this kind of volatility. So too might crypto true believers, for whom HODL, or “Hold on for dea...'}]

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
The news articles suggest a mixed outlook for the cryptocurrency market, particularly for Bitcoin and its related ETFs. BlackRock's filing for a bitcoin ETF with the SEC indicates a growing interest in cryptocurrency investment, potentially attracting more investors to the market. However, the increasing regulatory scrutiny, legal actions against major exchanges like Coinbase and Binance, and the SEC's rejection of spot bitcoin ETF applications could create uncertainty and volatility in the market. Additionally, the decoupling of Bitcoin from equities and the overall negative sentiment towards cryptocurrencies due to scams, complexity issues, and volatility may hinder the market's growth. Overall, while there is potential for growth with increased institutional interest, the market may face challenges in the short term due to regulatory concerns and negative perceptions.

After reviewing the reports from the on-chain analyst, news analyst, and reflection analyst, it is evident that the market is showing signs of potential bullish trends. The on-chain analyst report highlights a high total value transferred, low average fee, and a buy trend indicated by the MACD signal. The news analyst report also supports this sentiment, citing positive market sentiment and the potential approval of a bitcoin ETF by BlackRock. However, the reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of monitoring market trends closely and adopting a more conservative trading approach to mitigate risks.

Considering the overall market outlook and the need for a cautious approach, it is advisable to focus on long-term strategies rather than short-term gains. By closely monitoring market trends, news developments, and technical indicators, traders can make informed decisions to maximize profitability while managing risks effectively.

In line with this strategic approach, I would recommend taking a slightly bullish stance with a trading action of 0.5. This indicates a moderate level of confidence in the potential bullish trend while also acknowledging the need for caution and risk management in the current market environment.

After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that there is a bearish trend in the ETH market, with a decrease in trading activity and value transferred. The decrease in open price, average fee, total value transferred, total size used, number of unique addresses, coinbase transactions, and total number of transactions all point towards a negative sentiment in the market. Additionally, the change in MACD signal from buy to sell further supports the bearish outlook.

On the other hand, the news analyst report presents a mixed outlook for the overall cryptocurrency market, with potential growth opportunities due to increased institutional interest but challenges arising from regulatory concerns and negative perceptions.

In reflection of my recent trading performance, a cautious and informed approach has been successful in achieving positive returns. It is crucial to continue monitoring market trends closely and staying informed on developments that could impact the market.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is advisable to adopt a long-term strategy over short-term gains in the current market environment.

Therefore, a more conservative trading approach may be warranted to mitigate risks and maximize profitability in the cryptocurrency market.

Based on the analysis and the market trend, I would take a trading action with a confidence level of 0.2, indicating a slightly bearish stance and a cautious approach to managing risk in the current market conditions.

Discover SCENE\n\nA pricy Ethereum NFT from one of Web3’s preeminent PFP collections has been permanently removed from circulation and symbolically tied to an Ordinals inscription, as a group of Bitcoiners celebrate the costly, eye-catching endeavor.\n\nCryptoPunk #8611 sold for around 55 Ethereum or $95,000 on Saturday, according to Etherescan. And hours later, the NFT was burned in a way that points to inscription 12,456,749, an NFT-like asset on Bitcoin that bears the same image as its predecessor.\n\nThe decision to effectively destroy CryptoPunk #8611 was a community-led effort conducted by Wolf Capital Developer Nathan Stein on Twitter and holders of Bitcoin Bandits, a Western-themed collection of Ordinals inscriptions, a spokesperson for the project told Decrypt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n“The community rallied behind the idea like crazy,” the Bitcoin Bandits spokesperson said, adding that around 150 people contributed to the cause.\n\nWhen a digital asset is burned, it’s locked up for eternity in a digital wallet that nobody controls, and CryptoPunk #8611 has been put to rest in a well-known burn address that also contains $21 million worth of Ethereum.\n\n“What a wild night,” an account named Minh on Twitter told Decrypt, who also posted a video documenting the purchase and burning of CryptoPunk #8611. He described the move as “chaotic, yet beautiful.”\n\nOrdinals, a buzzy Bitcoin protocol that launched earlier this year, is used to create NFT-like assets on Bitcoin by “inscribing” data to individual satoshi, the smallest denomination of currency a Bitcoin can be broken down into. That data can include pictures, videos, or even plain text, which people have used to create BRC-20 tokens.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile NFTs could be considered a nascent industry or an emerging frontier for digital art, Ordinals inscriptions are much more new, leading to a wave of hype, bugs, and scams surrounding crypto’s oldest coin.\n\nAs the community surrounding Ordinals continues to take shape, siphoning off pricy NFTs from the Ethereum space and pointing them in the direction of other assets on Bitcoin is becoming a more common move, referred to as teleburning.\n\nSo, if Saturday’s CryptoPunk burn sounds somewhat familiar, that’s because it’s not the first time a pricy NFT has been burned by someone looking to symbolically shift an asset’s underlying chain from Ethereum to Bitcoin.\n\nIn February, an NFT from the Bored Ape Yacht Club collection worth around $169,000 at the time was burned by Jason Williams, who told Decrypt not long after that, essentially, “throwing a Lamborghini into a trash compactor” is kind of fun.\n\nNotably, Yuga Labs, creators of the Bored Ape Yacht Club, told Decrypt that the Ordinals inscription tied to Williams’ BAYC NFT represents an illegitimate ape, explaining only tokens that come from the project's original smart contract are considered valid, granting holders commercial rights and access to events.\n\nHowever, unlike Williams’ maneuver, CryptoPunk #8611 wasn’t burned purely for entertainment, according to Stein.\n\nThe end goal is to create a series of Ordinals inscriptions that correspond to a slice of ownership in CryptoPunk #8611—even though the underlying asset itself can no longer be owned by anyone on its original chain.\n\nThat collection of inscriptions will be created after the one that currently points to CryptoPunk #8611 is ceremonially sent to a digital wallet that belongs to Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, in what is effectively a one-way trip, Stein said in a tweet.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPhase #2 1- Send money to escrow\n\n2- Escrow buys Punk for them\n\n3- Escrow burns & inscribes it on BTC\n\n4- Escrow sends the punk to Satoshis wallet Ok! Now we have burned Punk 2 times LMAO Whats next? — NatanStein (@natan_stein) June 16, 2023\n\nMembers of the Bitcoin Bandits community who pooled funds together to purchase CryptoPunk #8611 have also been entered into a contest related to a separate inscriptions project—but that’s beside the point, the spokesperson said.\n\n“Bandits did it more to show the way,” the spokesperson said. “The Bandits Community thinks that CryptoPunks deserve better than ETH.”"}, {'id': 5, 'time': 'Sun, 18 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Bitcoin dips after reclaiming US$26,000, Ether falls; XRP gains, Tron leads losers in crypto top 10 - Yahoo Finance', 'content': 'Bitcoin dipped on Monday morning in Asia after reclaiming the US$26,000 support level over the weekend.

REASONING:
After reviewing the reports from the on-chain analyst, news analyst, and reflection analyst, it is evident that the market is showing signs of potential bullish trends. The on-chain analyst report highlights a high total value transferred, low average fee, and a buy trend indicated by the MACD signal. The news analyst report also supports this sentiment, citing positive market sentiment and the potential approval of a bitcoin ETF by BlackRock. However, the reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of monitoring market trends closely and adopting a more conservative trading approach to mitigate risks.

Considering the overall market outlook and the need for a cautious approach, it is advisable to focus on long-term strategies rather than short-term gains. By closely monitoring market trends, news developments, and technical indicators, traders can make informed decisions to maximize profitability while managing risks effectively.

In line with this strategic approach, I would recommend taking a slightly bullish stance with a trading action of 0.5.

After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that there is a bearish trend in the ETH market, with a decrease in trading activity and value transferred. The decrease in open price, average fee, total value transferred, total size used, number of unique addresses, coinbase transactions, and total number of transactions all point towards a negative sentiment in the market. Additionally, the change in MACD signal from buy to sell further supports the bearish outlook.

On the other hand, the news analyst report presents a mixed outlook for the overall cryptocurrency market, with potential growth opportunities due to increased institutional interest but challenges arising from regulatory concerns and negative perceptions.

In reflection of my recent trading performance, a cautious and informed approach has been successful in achieving positive returns. It is crucial to continue monitoring market trends closely and staying informed on developments that could impact the market.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is advisable to adopt a long-term strategy over short-term gains in the current market environment. While there may be potential for growth with increased institutional interest, the market faces challenges in the short term due to regulatory concerns and negative perceptions. Therefore, a more conservative trading approach may be warranted to mitigate risks and maximize profitability in the cryptocurrency market.

V0.7.1 of the network introduces comprehensive smart contract capabilities built using the popular CosmoWasm and Wasmd framework. It allows developers to extract security from Bitcoin to secure their applications and blockchains by deploying Babylon smart contracts.\n\nThe community has been eagerly anticipating this upgrade ever since Babylon's initial testnet launch four months ago. During this period, Babylon's testnet has drawn significant interest and integrated with 28 of the top Cosmos SDK chains, including Osmosis, Akash, Sei Network, Injective, Evmos, and Stride, thereby demonstrating traction for its technology. The integration arguably makes these Cosmos chains the most secure PoS chains in the world, as the solution combines the best of both worlds, Proof of Stake (PoS) & Proof of Work (PoW) security mechanisms. Additionally, channeling the value of PoS ecosystems into the Bitcoin network.\n\nThis upgrade extends Babylon's capabilities beyond the Cosmos ecosystem, enabling it to cater to a broader range of applications. It positions Babylon as a robust platform for developing decentralized applications for all verticals, especially DeFi, NFTs, and GameFi, where security is top priority.\n\nDavid Tse, Co-Founder of Babylon, said: “We are thrilled to announce the launch of Babylon v0.7.1, introducing the integration of smart contracts. This marks a crucial milestone for Babylon, turning it into a powerful platform for deploying a wide range of protocols, thereby facilitating the development of decentralized applications secured by the strength of the Bitcoin network.\n\nThis upgrade also paves the path to a spectacular Bitcoin-centric ecosystem. Babylon is leading the R&D of advanced scaling and security sharing protocols to fully unleash the potential of Bitcoin. Through Babylon smart contracts, the mighty power of Bitcoin will be readily at the disposal of the applications built on Babylon.\n\nStory continues\n\nBabylon recently announced the pioneering Bitcoin Staking Protocol, which enables Bitcoin the asset to be staked and used to secure Proof-of-Stake (PoS) chains. This is achieved without altering the Bitcoin blockchain nor any bridging. In return, participating Bitcoin holders can earn rewards for contributing to the security of PoS networks.\n\nAbout Babylon\n\nBabylon is a project that designs security protocols for the decentralized world. Babylon’s origins come from a research paper about Bitcoin security co-authored by co-founder of Babylon David Tse, a professor at Stanford and Ethereum 2.0 researcher, and the founder of EigenLayer Sreeram Kannan, and their colleagues. The project is led by a team of consensus protocol researchers from Stanford and experienced layer 1 engineers from around the world.\n\nBabylon's mission is to scale Bitcoin to secure the decentralized world. To achieve this, Babylon utilizes the three primary facets of Bitcoin: Bitcoin as an asset, its reliable timestamping service, its most censorship-resistant blockspace in the world,. To leverage these facets, Babylon is developing three innovative security-sharing protocols: Bitcoin Staking Protocol, Bitcoin Timestamping Protocol, and Bitcoin Data Availability Protocol. Through these pioneering protocols, Babylon envisions a more secure and decentralized future.\n\nLearn more: https://www.babylonchain.io/\n\nContact Details\n\nShalini Wood\n\nswood@babylonchain.io\n\nView source version on newsdirect.com: https://newsdirect.com/news/babylon-v0-7-1-goes-live-with-smart-contract-capabilities-and-bitcoin-security-for-dapps-728634553"}, {'id': 40, 'time': 'Mon, 19 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Bitcoin, Ether, rise; most top 10 cryptos fall as SEC lawsuit weighs on investor sentiment - Yahoo Finance', 'content': 'Bitcoin and Ether rose during Monday afternoon trading hours in Hong Kong, while most of the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization declined.

Despite some positive news such as NFT sales and interest in digital art, the overall market trend appears cautious with potential challenges ahead.

In reflection, it is evident that a cautious and informed approach to trading has been successful in navigating the current market conditions. Monitoring on-chain and news analyst reports for trends and developments has been crucial in making informed decisions.

Considering the synthesized reports, the clear market trend appears to be cautious with potential downward movements and regulatory challenges ahead. Therefore, a long-term strategy focused on risk management and conservative trading approach is recommended to maximize profitability in the cryptocurrency market.

Based on this analysis, my trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.7, reflecting a bearish outlook and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately in the current market environment.

The news articles indicate a mixed sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin reclaiming over 50% market dominance following positive developments such as BlackRock filing for a Bitcoin Spot ETF. However, the market is also facing challenges, as Japan's crypto exchanges seek looser margin trading caps and the SEC lawsuit against Binance and Coinbase weighs on investor sentiment, leading to declines in most top 10 cryptocurrencies. Additionally, the launch of Babylon v0.7.1 with smart contract capabilities and Bitcoin security for dApps could potentially impact the market positively. Overall, the market trend may be influenced by regulatory developments, market dominance shifts, and technological advancements in the coming days.

*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing volatility and uncertainty, with fluctuations in various key indicators such as price, transaction volume, fees, and total value transferred. The lack of a clear direction in the MACD signal suggests a mixed market sentiment.

The news analyst report further adds to the mixed sentiment in the market, with positive developments such as Bitcoin reclaiming market dominance and advancements in technology like the launch of Babylon v0.7.1. However, challenges such as regulatory concerns and negative news impacting investor sentiment are also present.

In reflection of the reports, it is evident that a cautious and informed approach to trading is crucial in navigating the current market environment. Monitoring trends from on-chain and news analysts, focusing on long-term profitability, and managing risks effectively have been successful strategies.

Considering the current market conditions and the importance of long-term profitability, it is advisable to adopt a more conservative trading approach. Short-term gains may be overshadowed by the volatility and uncertainty in the market. Therefore, a strategic decision to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains is recommended.

Given the mixed market sentiment and the need for a conservative approach, I would take a neutral trading action with a confidence level of 0.0. This decision reflects a balanced approach to managing risks and maximizing profitability in the current market environment.

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRomanian prosecutors asked to seize 15 properties, 15 luxury cars, 14 watches and bitcoin worth $560,000 from Andrew Tate as part of indictment on rape and trafficking charges.\n\nRomania\'s Directorate for the Investigation of Organized Crime and Terrorism announced Tuesday that Tate had been charged with rape and human trafficking, per a press release.\n\nThe announcement moved forward the case which burst into view in late last year with Tate\'s arrest. The requested asset seizures are a window into the wealth amassed by Tate, which is a key part of his online person and has loomed large in the criminal case against him.\n\nTate, a social media influencer best known for his misogynistic messaging, was arrested in December and placed in a Romanian jail while officials investigated human-trafficking and sexual assault allegations against him. He has been under house arrest since March.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe indictment includes Tate, his brother Tristan Tate, and two associates, all of whom face the same charges. The indictment also names seven victims who were recruited through the "loverboy method," the BBC reported — the method of using promises of love and marriage to manipulate women into sex work. All four maintain their innocence.\n\nReports of charges against the group describe a bleak world in which women made pornography for Tate under duress, with Tate\'s associates, Georgiana Naghel and Luana Radu, threatening to beat the women if they did not comply. Per Reuters, a 61-page court file said Naghel and Radu took half the money the women made via OnlyFans accounts, and also fined the women if they were late or sniffled on camera.\n\nThe file, made by Romanian prosecutors, also allege these women were transformed "into slaves," and one was raped by Tate twice.\n\nTate\'s assets that DIICOT has asked to seize includes just over 21 bitcoin, a DIICOT spokesperson confirmed to Insider. That amount of bitcoin is worth around $560,000 as of June 20. The assets could be used to compensate victims if he\'s convicted, Romanian authorities previously told Insider.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome auto-translate software, including Google Translate, erroneously suggested that a much larger amount of Bitcoin worth $384 million had been seized, due to an error in interpreting the original Romanian.\n\nTate\'s wealth has been part of the investigation since the beginning. He was denied bail by a judge several times between January and March, because he was deemed a flight risk.\n\nThe judge in the case explained his decision to force the Tates to stay in jail, arguing that their wealth meant it was possible they would try and escape.\n\n"The possibility that the suspects would evade investigation, leave Romania and settle in countries that do not allow extradition given their financial possibilities and public comments to that regard cannot be ignored," the judge said, according to Euro News.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTate\'s boasting about his money are just some of the public statements he\'s made that could work against him in court. Over the years he has willingly described his tactics recruiting women, came close to endorsing rape, and said he moved to Romania because "corruption is far more accessible."\n\nWhile he was incarcerated, Tate continued communicating with his fans — most of whom are young boys and men — through his newsletter, complaining of poor conditions, including lice and cockroaches in his cell.\n\nThe BBC reported that the trial is expected to last several years, and a Romanian judge has 60 days to view all the evidence before then.\n\nTate\'s spokesperson told the BBC: "We embrace the opportunity it presents to demonstrate their innocence."'}]

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that there is a bearish trend in the ETH market, with a decrease in trading activity and value transferred. The decrease in open price, average fee, total value transferred, total size used, number of unique addresses, coinbase transactions, and total number of transactions all point towards a negative sentiment in the market. Additionally, the change in MACD signal from buy to sell further supports the bearish outlook.

On the other hand, the news analyst report presents a mixed outlook for the overall cryptocurrency market, with potential growth opportunities due to increased institutional interest but challenges arising from regulatory concerns and negative perceptions.

Read preview\n\nThere are exceptional and very ordinary aspects of the application BlackRock filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission last week to launch a exchange-traded fund that would track the price of bitcoin.\n\nBlackRock is a fund manager. It creates, manages, and distributes funds. It has 1,300 ETFs! This is literally what it does! And investors knew about the partnership BlackRock struck last year with Coinbase, the crypto exchange BlackRock said it would use as a bitcoin custodian on behalf of the iShares Bitcoin Trust if regulators approve it.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nThe effort to launch a spot bitcoin ETF, though, is a meaningful development in cryptoland. "The future of crypto is more BlackRock and less Binance," Matt Hougan, chief investment officer of Bitwise Asset Management, tweeted, and Galaxy Digital CEO Michael Novogratz tweeted that BlackRock launching a bitcoin ETF "would be the best thing that could happen" to bitcoin.\n\nWall Street\'s top regulator has so far rejected other, smaller asset managers\' applications to launch similar vehicles. The crypto money manager Grayscale even sued the SEC last year after it tossed out Grayscale\'s application to turn a bitcoin trust into a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd a renewed commitment between the world\'s largest asset manager and Coinbase, which the SEC accused of violating securities laws earlier this month, may give the crypto company a reputational boost. (Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said in a tweet on June 6 that "the complaint filed against us is exclusively focused on what is or is not a security," and that "we are confident in our facts and the law.")\n\nI\'ve covered BlackRock\'s path to embracing crypto. Here\'s part of my inside story with Morgan Chittum from last fall, below, and here\'s a separate rundown of the BlackRock employees involved in crypto initiatives at the firm.\n\nBut even as crypto enthusiasts found advocates internally, people left. There was a "line in BlackRock to do the fun work" of working on digital assets or blockchain research full time, another former employee said.\n\nIt "looked impossible for BlackRock to do anything" significant in the space in the near term, the person said. "That\'s why I think many of us left."\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlackRock is now working on its partnerships with Coinbase and Circle and focusing on the four parts of its crypto strategy: stablecoins, tokenization, permissioned blockchains, and crypto assets.\n\nBlackRock leadership is highlighting those efforts. While acknowledging the "steep downturn" in crypto assets, Fink said on an earnings conference call this summer that the firm was still seeing "more interest from institutional clients about how to efficiently access these assets."\n\nThe price of bitcoin has rallied near its highest level of 2023 in the days since BlackRock filed its application, eclipsing $30,000 on Wednesday. Potential implications for the wider digital assets ecosystem aside, it\'s worth examining other reactions to the application.\n\nCrypto influencers have seized on BlackRock\'s new crypto efforts, underscoring the relatively new scrutiny BlackRock faces from the everyday investors and the general public. Enter the outlandish comments about BlackRock\'s position in the crypto market, another front in the scrutiny around the firm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n"So BlackRock, Citadel, Deutsche Bank and NASDAQ have all started to enter the crypto space in the last week. They\'ve bullied out participants so they can scoop up cheap coins. The trajectory for crypto has never been more clear," one venture capitalist wrote to his 197,000 followers.\n\nA business podcast host tweeted to his 903,000 followers: "They\'re not trying to kill crypto. They\'re trying to kill the current crypto industry and then hand it over to their cronies. Citadel, BlackRock, Schwab JPMorgan…" (These tweets refer to Citadel, the hedge fund founded and led by billionaire Ken Griffin. But it is market maker Citadel Securities, also founded by Griffin, that backed a recently launched crypto exchange called EDX.)\n\nA BlackRock spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nOf course, the firm\'s sheer size has long been the subject of criticism from regulators and officials who take issue with its dominance in the ETF market. But the ESG investing-related scrutiny that ramped up last year has brought a new awareness of BlackRock to the mainstream. That\'s pushed BlackRock to get ahead of theories and videos that spread widely online; I spoke with Rich Latour, the firm\'s global head of content and media about that a year ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n"...'}, {'id': 8, 'time': 'Wed, 21 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "A Bitcoin Renaissance: It's Not All About the Price - Nasdaq", 'content': "To say OG blockchain Bitcoin has proven impervious to assassination attempts would be a stretch, but it’s certainly shown itself to be robust and resilient since Satoshi Nakamoto bequeathed it to the world nearly 15 years ago. Despite numerous attempts to undermine, ban, burn and bury it, it continues to operate as a highly efficient, highly secure settlement network and a beacon of hope for those who've become disillusioned by the traditional financial system.\n\nObsessively tracking the price movements of bitcoin (BTC) has turned into a favorite pastime of many, with detractors delighting in announcing Bitcoin’s demise only to crawl back under a rock when it inevitably rides out the rough spells. But continually sweating the value of one’s stack does a disservice to the slow, steady and unsexy work that continues to go into finessing Bitcoin’s operation. That said, a lot of developments have been happening at the blockchain level in recent months, to the extent that the price of bitcoin, for once, has become almost an afterthought.\n\nEven if the BTC price goes down – and it may well notch its first month of losses in 2023 – it’s possible that Bitcoin may, as a consequence of such developments, cement its status as the preeminent layer-1 chain by claiming its rightful place above a sea of imitators and competitors.\n\nFrom Ordinals to Mintlayer: Bitcoin’s Roaring 2023\n\nThese developments cannot have escaped your attention. Propelled by surging activity on Ordinals, the protocol that belatedly brought NFTs to Bitcoin, Satoshi’s network became the second biggest NFT blockchain in May. A fact made all the more staggering given Bitcoin NFTs didn’t exist prior to January.\n\nNFT sales on Bitcoin blew other blockchains out of the water as users started obsessively inscribing satoshis with data including Jpegs and text. The hype, for once, was real – even if many hardline Bitcoiners view Ordinals and the so-called BRC-20 token standard as a distraction. Indeed, Samson Mow told Cointelegraph that he expects the ‘unsustainable' hype around Ordinals and BRC20 tokens to fade away within a matter of months.\n\nThe success of Ordinals, not to mention subsequent bitcoin NFT support from the likes of Binance, can be set to one side: the blockchain’s 2023 renaissance is about more than just non-fungible tokens. We see it with Babylon, a project that wants to leverage the security of Bitcoin to augment and enhance the security of other chains, specifically those in the Cosmos ecosystem.\n\nEffectively, Babylon boosts the appeal of Bitcoin by functioning as a go-between between chains that need extra security and the gold-standard network. The project has ambitions to eventually get hundreds of chains using its service, since almost all will benefit from an extra layer of security. Just announced by its lead researcher, David Tse of Stanford University, a BTC staking protocol – the first of its kind, that allows BTC holders to participate in staking of other PoS networks. This new mechanism finally lends the famed security of the bitcoin blockchain for other, less secure PoS smart contract blockchain protocols.\n\nAnother project extending Bitcoin’s function and enhancing its reputation is a collaboration between Swiss non-profit ZeroSync Association and infrastructure firm Blockstream. The partners are planning to broadcast Bitcoin zero-knowledge proofs from Blockstream’s satellite, enabling the network’s nodes to sync quickly from anywhere on Earth.\n\nGiven that one weapon of FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) aimed at Bitcoin suggests an internet blackout could destroy it, this seems like a worthwhile endeavor. Favoring ZK-proofs frees nodes from the need to download Bitcoin’s 500GB of data and ensures expeditious syncing rather than a slow, methodical grind. The partnership has earmarked late 2023 for the first experimental broadcast from Blockstream’s satellite network.\n\nThe DeFi boom of a few years back, followed by the arrival of GameFi and NFTs, may have created the impression that Bitcoin was being left behind. Or perhaps left to its devices, the better to focus on its original raison d’etre as a store of value. Yet that impression is changing, and there is a growing sense that the single-function decentralized garden is opening up and coming into bloom. Forget the price of bitcoin for a second; the recent mood music may represent a new ascent of Bitcoin as a chain for all seasons.\n\nCan DeFi live on Bitcoin? It’s a question many have mulled since DeFi Summer began in earnest three years ago. Now that we have Bitcoin-based NFTs, as well as layer-2 solutions like Mintlayer which let users build a DeFi ecosystem rooted in Bitcoin, it’s no longer in the realms of the hypothetical.\n\nAs a Bitcoin sidechain supported by the Lightning Network, Mintlayer dispenses with the need for wrapped tokens or blockchain bridges (as well as their smart contract vulnerabilities), enabling users to directly exchange BTC using atomic swaps.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is experiencing fluctuations in open prices, transaction fees, total value transferred, and MACD signals. The switch from a buy to a sell signal suggests a potential bearish trend, coupled with a decrease in trading activity and uncertainty in market movements.

The news analyst report highlights mixed movements in the cryptocurrency market, with regulatory concerns impacting trading platforms and investor sentiment. Despite some positive news such as NFT sales and interest in digital art, the overall market trend appears cautious with potential challenges ahead.

In reflection, it is evident that a cautious and informed approach to trading has been successful in navigating the current market conditions. Monitoring on-chain and news analyst reports for trends and developments has been crucial in making informed decisions.

Considering the synthesized reports, the clear market trend appears to be cautious with potential downward movements and regulatory challenges ahead. Therefore, a long-term strategy focused on risk management and conservative trading approach is recommended to maximize profitability in the cryptocurrency market.

Based on this analysis, my trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.7, reflecting a bearish outlook and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately in the current market environment.
ACTION:
-0.7
DAILY RETURN:
0.002336860458703738
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing volatility and uncertainty, with fluctuations in various key indicators such as price, transaction volume, fees, and total value transferred. The lack of a clear direction in the MACD signal suggests a mixed market sentiment.

The news analyst report further adds to the mixed sentiment in the market, with positive developments such as Bitcoin reclaiming market dominance and advancements in technology like the launch of Babylon v0.7.1. However, challenges such as regulatory concerns and negative news impacting investor sentiment are also present.

In reflection of the reports, it is evident that a cautious and informed approach to trading is crucial in navigating the current market environment. Monitoring trends from on-chain and news analysts, focusing on long-term profitability, and managing risks effectively have been successful strategies.

Considering the current market conditions and the importance of long-term profitability, it is advisable to adopt a more conservative trading approach. Short-term gains may be overshadowed by the volatility and uncertainty in the market. Therefore, a strategic decision to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains is recommended.

Given the mixed market sentiment and the need for a conservative approach, I would take a neutral trading action with a confidence level of 0.0. This decision reflects a balanced approach to managing risks and maximizing profitability in the current market environment.
ACTION:
0.0
DAILY RETURN:
0.013375112768601483
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that there is uncertainty in the market trend for ETH, with a potential bearish movement indicated by the MACD signal shifting from buy to sell. The fluctuating open prices, total value transferred, and total size used suggest volatility in transaction activity, further supporting the uncertain market trend.

Contrastingly, the news analyst report highlights a positive sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, particularly for Bitcoin and Ether. The surge in Bitcoin prices due to institutional interest and positive developments in the market indicate a potential upward trend for ETH and other cryptocurrencies in the near future.

Reflecting on the reports, it is clear that a cautious and informed approach is necessary to navigate the current market conditions successfully. While short-term gains may be tempting, prioritizing long-term profitability and managing risks effectively is crucial in maximizing overall profit.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is advisable to focus on long-term strategies over short-term gains. The positive sentiment in the market, driven by institutional interest and positive developments, suggests a potential upward trend for ETH. However, the uncertainty and volatility indicated by the on-chain analyst report emphasize the importance of a conservative trading approach to mitigate risks effectively.

Therefore, I would take a slightly bullish trading action with a confidence level of 0.3, indicating a cautious approach while still capitalizing on the potential upward trend in the market.

The filing of ETF applications by major financial institutions like BlackRock has been seen as a positive development for Bitcoin, with experts suggesting that a spot Bitcoin ETF could be a game-changer for the cryptocurrency.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing volatility and uncertainty, with fluctuations in various key indicators such as price, transaction volume, fees, and total value transferred. The lack of a clear direction in the MACD signal suggests a mixed market sentiment.

The news analyst report further adds to the mixed sentiment in the market, with positive developments such as Bitcoin reclaiming market dominance and advancements in technology like the launch of Babylon v0.7.1. However, challenges such as regulatory concerns and negative news impacting investor sentiment are also present.

In reflection of the reports, it is evident that a cautious and informed approach to trading is crucial in navigating the current market environment. Monitoring trends from on-chain and news analysts, focusing on long-term profitability, and managing risks effectively have been successful strategies.

Considering the current market conditions and the importance of long-term profitability, it is advisable to adopt a more conservative trading approach. Short-term gains may be overshadowed by the volatility and uncertainty in the market. Therefore, a strategic decision to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains is recommended.

Given the mixed market sentiment and the need for a conservative approach, I would take a neutral trading action with a confidence level of 0.0. This decision reflects a balanced approach to managing risks and maximizing profitability in the current market environment.
ACTION:
0.0
DAILY RETURN:
0.013375112768601483
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that there is uncertainty in the market trend for ETH, with a potential bearish movement indicated by the MACD signal shifting from buy to sell. The fluctuating open prices, total value transferred, and total size used suggest volatility in transaction activity, further supporting the uncertain market trend.

Contrastingly, the news analyst report highlights a positive sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, particularly for Bitcoin and Ether. The surge in Bitcoin prices due to institutional interest and positive developments in the market indicate a potential upward trend for ETH and other cryptocurrencies in the near future.

Reflecting on the reports, it is clear that a cautious and informed approach is necessary to navigate the current market conditions successfully. While short-term gains may be tempting, prioritizing long-term profitability and managing risks effectively is crucial in maximizing overall profit.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is advisable to focus on long-term strategies over short-term gains. The positive sentiment in the market, driven by institutional interest and positive developments, suggests a potential upward trend for ETH. However, the uncertainty and volatility indicated by the on-chain analyst report emphasize the importance of a conservative trading approach to mitigate risks effectively.

Therefore, I would take a slightly bullish trading action with a confidence level of 0.3, indicating a cautious approach while still capitalizing on the potential upward trend in the market.
ACTION:
0.3
DAILY RETURN:
0.027505628745846833
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the ETH market is currently experiencing bearish sentiment with fluctuations in price, transaction volume, and other key indicators. The MACD signal consistently indicating a sell trend further supports the bearish outlook.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights the positive impact of Bitcoin's recent surge on the overall cryptocurrency market, suggesting a potential bullish sentiment. The growing interest from institutional investors and the development of new projects in the space indicate a positive outlook for cryptocurrencies, including ETH.

In reflection, it is clear that a cautious and informed approach to trading, prioritizing long-term profitability over short-term gains, has been successful in navigating the current market conditions. Monitoring key indicators and staying informed on market sentiment are crucial for making strategic decisions.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is important to acknowledge the potential for both bearish and bullish trends in the market. However, given the current volatility and uncertainty, a conservative trading approach is warranted to manage risks effectively and capitalize on potential upward trends while mitigating losses.

Therefore, I would take a slightly bearish stance on the market trend and opt for a conservative trading action by selling ETH with a confidence level of -0.3. This decision reflects a cautious approach to managing risk and prioritizing long-term profitability in the current market environment.

The cryptocurrency market experienced a mix of positive and negative news on June 23, 2023. Bitcoin reached its highest level in a year, showing renewed interest in digital assets despite ongoing challenges. However, the market saw a decline in prices, with Bitcoin holding above $30,000 but experiencing a 0.73% drop. Other cryptocurrencies like BNB and Polygon shed over 4%.

"""
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that there is uncertainty in the market trend for ETH, with a potential bearish movement indicated by the MACD signal shifting from buy to sell. The fluctuating open prices, total value transferred, and total size used suggest volatility in transaction activity, further supporting the uncertain market trend.

Contrastingly, the news analyst report highlights a positive sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, particularly for Bitcoin and Ether. The surge in Bitcoin prices due to institutional interest and positive developments in the market indicate a potential upward trend for ETH and other cryptocurrencies in the near future.

Reflecting on the reports, it is clear that a cautious and informed approach is necessary to navigate the current market conditions successfully. While short-term gains may be tempting, prioritizing long-term profitability and managing risks effectively is crucial in maximizing overall profit.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is advisable to focus on long-term strategies over short-term gains. The positive sentiment in the market, driven by institutional interest and positive developments, suggests a potential upward trend for ETH. However, the uncertainty and volatility indicated by the on-chain analyst report emphasize the importance of a conservative trading approach to mitigate risks effectively.

Therefore, I would take a slightly bullish trading action with a confidence level of 0.3, indicating a cautious approach while still capitalizing on the potential upward trend in the market.

The growing interest from institutional investors and the development of new projects in the space indicate a positive outlook for cryptocurrencies, including ETH.

In reflection, it is clear that a cautious and informed approach to trading, prioritizing long-term profitability over short-term gains, has been successful in navigating the current market conditions. Monitoring key indicators and staying informed on market sentiment are crucial for making strategic decisions.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is important to acknowledge the potential for both bearish and bullish trends in the market. However, given the current volatility and uncertainty, a conservative trading approach is warranted to manage risks effectively and capitalize on potential upward trends while mitigating losses.

Therefore, I would take a slightly bearish stance on the market trend and opt for a conservative trading action by selling ETH with a confidence level of -0.3. This decision reflects a cautious approach to managing risk and prioritizing long-term profitability in the current market environment.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights a mix of positive and negative news in the cryptocurrency market. While there are positive indicators such as Bitcoin reaching its highest level in a year and the launch of a double-Bitcoin ETF, there are also negative factors like the Twitter hacker's sentencing and market corrections.

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a cautious and informed approach prioritizing long-term profitability is crucial in navigating the current market conditions. By monitoring key indicators like the MACD signal and staying informed on market trends through news analysis, traders can make strategic decisions to manage risks effectively.

In conclusion, the overall market trend for ETH appears to be bearish in the short term, but there are potential positive catalysts that could drive market sentiment upwards in the long term. Therefore, it is advisable to adopt a conservative trading approach to capitalize on potential upward trends while mitigating losses.

Based on the synthesized reports and the emphasis on long-term strategies, I would take a slightly bearish stance with a trading action of -0.3, reflecting a moderate level of confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.

*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
After reviewing the reports from the on-chain analyst, news analyst, and reflection analyst, it is clear that there are mixed signals in the market. The on-chain analyst report indicates a bullish sentiment with increasing activity and value transferred on the ETH network, but caution is advised due to the sell signal on the MACD. The news analyst report highlights positive market sentiment driven by the surge in Bitcoin's price and growing institutional interest in cryptocurrencies. However, the reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a cautious and informed approach to trading in the current volatile market conditions.

Taking into consideration the mixed signals and the emphasis on long-term profitability, it is prudent to adopt a conservative trading strategy. While short-term gains may be tempting, prioritizing long-term profitability and risk management is crucial in navigating the uncertainties of the cryptocurrency market.

Therefore, I would take a slightly cautious approach and make a trading action of 0.3, indicating moderate confidence in the market trend. This decision reflects a balanced approach that considers both the bullish sentiment in the market and the potential risks highlighted in the reports. By prioritizing long-term profitability and staying informed on market trends, I aim to maximize my overall profit while managing risks effectively.

While the price of Bitcoin dropped sharply on Monday, it is still up more than 50 percent from just a month ago, when it passed its previous all-time high of around $20,000.\n\nThe problem is that Mr. Thomas years ago lost the paper where he wrote down the password for his IronKey, which gives users 10 guesses before it seizes up and encrypts its contents forever. He has since tried eight of his most commonly used password formulations — to no avail.\n\n“I would just lay in bed and think about it,” Mr. Thomas said. “Then I would go to the computer with some new strategy, and it wouldn’t work, and I would be desperate again.”'}, {'id': 12, 'time': 'Sun, 25 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "They Found a Way to Limit Big Tech's Power: Using the Design of Bitcoin (Published 2021) - The New York Times", 'content': 'SAN FRANCISCO — Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s chief executive, publicly wrestled this month with the question of whether his social media service had exercised too much power by cutting off Donald J. Trump’s account. Mr. Dorsey wondered aloud if the solution to that power imbalance was new technology inspired by the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.\n\nWhen YouTube and Facebook barred tens of thousands of Mr. Trump’s supporters and white supremacists this month, many flocked to alternative apps such as LBRY, Minds and Sessions. What those sites had in common was that they were also inspired by the design of Bitcoin.\n\nThe twin developments were part of a growing movement by technologists, investors and everyday users to replace some of the internet’s fundamental building blocks in ways that would be harder for tech giants like Facebook and Google to control.\n\nTo do so, they are increasingly focused on new technological ideas introduced by Bitcoin, which was built atop an online network designed, at the most basic level, to decentralize power.'}, {'id': 13, 'time': 'Sun, 25 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'SEC Approves First Ever Leveraged Bitcoin Futures ETF - Yahoo Finance', 'content': 'SEC Approves First Ever Leveraged Bitcoin Futures ETF\n\nThe BITX Fund Was Approved by the SEC\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved the first leveraged Bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund (ETF), Volatility Shares 2X Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITX). It is scheduled to launch on the Chicago Board Options BZX Exchange on 27 June, 2023.\n\nThe fund looks for investment returns that are equivalent to double the return of the CME Bitcoin Futures Daily Roll Index. Investors can purchase shares of an ETF, which bundles securities like equities and commodities, to receive exposure to those securities without actually owning them.\n\nThere are two main types of Bitcoin ETFs: Bitcoin futures and Bitcoin spot. BITX will be a leveraged ETF, using Bitcoin futures as leverage to amplify the returns of a benchmark index. The news was largely applauded by proponents of cryptocurrencies, but others wondered why a simple spot ETF launched before a 2X leveraged futures offering. The BITX fund was approved by the SEC as large traditional financial institutions look to enter the cryptocurrency market recently.'}, {'id': 30, 'time': 'Sun, 25 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Crypto has a new rescuer: Wall Street - Yahoo Finance', 'content': 'Some of the biggest names in finance are making new bets on cryptocurrencies, adding competition and momentum to an upstart industry that is under increasing pressure from US regulators.\n\nThe world\'s largest money manager, BlackRock (BLK), wants to start a new exchange-traded fund that would use bitcoin as an underlying asset.\n\nTwo other sizable money managers, Fidelity Investments and Charles Schwab (SCHW), are backing a new cryptocurrency exchange with Citadel Securities.\n\nAnd one of the world\'s biggest lenders, Deutsche Bank, wants to operate a crypto custody business that would hold digital assets for its clients.\n\nThese endorsements from institutions that have a track record on Wall Street are helping to push the value of cryptocurrencies higher, especially bitcoin (BTC-USD).\n\nThe world’s largest cryptocurrency rose to its highest price in a year on Friday, to $31,389, after climbing above $30,000 for the first time since April. Through Friday bitcoin had risen 81% year to date.\n\nOther cryptocurrencies also surged this week, including ether (ETH-USD) and Avalanche\'s AVAX (AVAX-USD) token.\n\nThe total market capitalization for crypto assets reached $1.2 trillion on Friday, 14% higher than where it stood a week earlier.\n\nRising peril\n\nThis new interest from mainstream financial institutions comes at a time of rising peril for an industry that struggled to regain its footing following the 2022 implosion of cryptocurrency exchange FTX and the regulatory crackdown that followed.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this month filed lawsuits against the biggest crypto exchanges in the US and the world, Coinbase (COIN) and Binance, alleging they both allowed digital currencies to trade on their platforms that should have been registered with the agency.\n\nThat stoked new concerns that it could become more difficult to trade certain digital assets. Since the beginning of 2023 the SEC has charged 15 different crypto actors with violating securities laws.\n\nStory continues\n\nA surprise turnaround in sentiment about the industry started June 15, when BlackRock, which controls more than $9 trillion in assets, filed paperwork with the SEC to create a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund.\n\nSuch a fund would be tagged to the value of the original digital asset instead of merely tracking bitcoin futures. Coinbase would be the custodian for the bitcoin holdings.\n\n"I think there\'s an element of — we need institutional custodians to step in and play roles and participate in digital token economies," BlackRock’s head of strategic partnerships Joseph Chalom said Thursday at the Coinbase State of Crypto Summit in partnership with the FT.\n\nThe value of bitcoin soared on the announcement. Other institutional players such as Invesco and Wisdom Tree Investments quickly followed by renewing spot bitcoin ETF applications they had previously submitted to regulators.\n\nThe efforts still face a significant hurdle. The SEC has denied 27 prior applications to create spot bitcoin ETFs since 2013, arguing the products are vulnerable to market manipulation.\n\nWisdom Tree, in fact, was turned away in 2021. One asset manager, Grayscale Investments, is suing the SEC because it wasn\'t allowed to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot bitcoin offering.\n\n\'Conflicts of interest\'\n\nAnother catalyst for the industry came this week when a new cryptocurrency exchange that has backing from Citadel, Fidelity and Charles Schwab said it had begun executing trades.\n\nThe venture, EDX Markets, began discussing its plans in late 2022 and touting itself as an operation that would "remove significant conflicts of interest that affect existing cryptocurrency exchanges."\n\nIt made the same point again last week, citing a "non-custodial model designed to mitigate conflicts of interest." It won\'t handle digital assets owned by customers, instead running a marketplace where buyers and sellers deal with each other directly.\n\nAs part of FTX\'s collapse last year it was revealed that an affiliated trading firm used customer assets to make its own trades. The SEC has also alleged that Binance misused customer funds, a charge Binance denies.\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nEarlier this month SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a briefing with reporters that a standard business model for crypto exchanges is "built on conflicts," "limited disclosure” and “at times deception."\n\nJamil Nazarali, CEO of EDX, said in an interview that "FTX just validated our business model." What EDC is doing, he added, is "taking the best of the digital world, 24 by seven trading, many of the innovations of blockchain and combining it with the investor protections in traditional finance."\n\nEDX says it will offer trading in just four cryptocurrencies—bitcoin, ether, litecoin and bitcoin cash. None of those assets have been deemed securities by the SEC, allowing EDX to potentially sidestep some of the p...'}, {'id': 2, 'time': 'Sun, 25 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Bitcoin is up 12% this month — even though barely anybody is trading it - CNBC', 'content': 'In this article BTC.CM= Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nAndriy Onufriyenko | Moment | Getty Images\n\nBitcoin has rallied sharply this month — but not for reasons you might think. The world\'s largest digital currency has risen more than 12% since the beginning of June. On Wednesday, its price topped $30,000 to hit its highest level since April 14, according to Coin Metrics data. Market players have attributed the jump to the news that U.S. asset management giant BlackRock had filed for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund tracking the market price of the underlying asset. While that may be part of the reason, the outsized moved can be put down to another factor beyond the news flow surrounding large institutions taking steps to embrace bitcoin or other digital assets.\n\nThin liquidity and big players\n\nCrypto "market depth" has been sitting at very low levels this year. Market depth refers to a market\'s ability to absorb relatively large buy and sell orders. When market depth is low and big players put in orders to buy or sell digital coins, prices can move in a big way up or down, even if the orders are not that huge. Market depth is a measure of liquidity in a market. According to data firm Kaiko, bitcoin\'s market depth has fallen 20% since the start of this year. Bitcoin has been one of the hardest-hit cryptocurrencies in terms of market depth, Kaiko said.\n\nThe market depth of bitcoin at a 1% range from the mid price has fallen about 20% since the start of the year, according to data firm Kaiko. Kaiko\n\n"Bitcoin\'s recent surge in value has largely been driven by large trades within a less liquid market," Jamie Sly, head of research at CCData, told CNBC via email. "Our analysis of market orders over 5 BTC reveals an aggressive surge in market buying, suggesting large players are seeking to gain exposure to digital assets." "When combining large orders with thin books, the market is subject to more volatile movements," Sly added. That lack of liquidity has in part been driven by the regulatory scrutiny of the crypto industry from U.S. authorities. The Securities and Exchange Commission has sued major exchanges such as Coinbase and Binance. Low liquidity, which has been a feature of the crypto market all year, is also partly behind bitcoin\'s 80% year-to-date rally.\n\nRetail traders aren\'t back — yet\n\nAnother notable feature of the current crypto market is the low volumes being traded on exchanges. Daily trading volume in the cryptocurrency currently sits at around $24 billion, according to crypto data website CoinGecko.\n\nThat\'s down markedly from the more than $100 billion of overall trading volume in bitcoin during the peak of the 2021 crypto rally, when bitcoin rose close to an all-time high of nearly $69,000. Large crypto investors usually hope that an early surge in prices will be enough to tempt retail investors back into participating in the rally which ultimately boosts prices for bitcoin and other digital coins. But that hasn\'t happened. "What is notable about this rally is that trade volumes overall are at multi-year lows, and we are only seeing a slight increase, which even then is far lower than levels we saw from January to March," Clara Medalie, director of research at Kaiko, told CNBC. "I think trading volumes and price volatility are two of the most telling indicators of crypto market activity. Both volatility and volumes are at multi-year lows, and even a rapid increase in price is not enough to draw traders in."\n\n\'It\'s not a market for ordinary clients\'\n\nIn the last bitcoin cycle, market momentum was largely driven by big, institutional names as investment banks from Morgan Stanley to Goldman Sachs set up trading desks to give their clients exposure to the digital currency. However, the market really started to break out only when retail traders started to take notice — in early 2021, people became tempted by the phenomenon that was NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, and other more speculative bets. Later that year, the cryptocurrency market experienced a seismic rally, with the price of bitcoin zooming to unprecedented levels. That was in tandem with surging trading volume, which climbed from $21.2 billion at the start of 2020 to $105.4 billion on Nov. 9, 2021, when bitcoin hits its all-time high, according to CoinGecko. Today, trading volume is nowhere near where it was at the height of the 2021 crypto boom. "Any bit of news, if it\'s good, then the professional traders trade — otherwise, they\'re not trading," Carol Alexander, a professor of finance at the University of Sussex, told CNBC. "If a bit of good news like the bitcoin ETF comes, they fire the cannons upwards." BlackRock\'s ETF filing was followed by similar move from Invesco and WisdomTree, which also filed for their own respective bitcoin-related products.\n\nwatch now\n\n"Bitcoin and ether are both being manipulated in this way by the professional traders. They don\'t trade most of the time, they wait until there\'s a bit of good ...'}]

In reflecting on my recent trading performance, it is evident that adopting a cautious and informed approach prioritizing long-term profitability has been successful in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. Key indicators such as the MACD signal, on-chain activity, and news sentiment have played a crucial role in making strategic trading decisions. While there have been mixed signals in the market, balancing bullish sentiment with risk management has been effective in maximizing overall profit.

*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing a downward trend, as indicated by the sell signals from the MACD indicator and the fluctuating total value transferred and total size used for transactions. This suggests a bearish sentiment in the short term.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights positive developments in the cryptocurrency market, such as the approval of the first leveraged Bitcoin futures ETF and increased involvement of major financial institutions. These events indicate a growing interest and acceptance of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, which could lead to a bullish market trend in the near future.

In reflecting on the reports, it is important to adopt a cautious and informed approach that prioritizes long-term profitability. While short-term gains may be tempting, it is crucial to consider the overall market trend and potential future developments.

Considering the mixed signals in the market, it is advisable to maintain a conservative trading strategy that balances bullish sentiment with risk management. By staying informed on key indicators, market trends, and adopting a long-term perspective, traders can effectively navigate the uncertainties and fluctuations in the cryptocurrency market.

Based on the synthesized reports, I would recommend a conservative trading action with a confidence level of 0.3. This reflects a cautious approach to managing risk while still being open to potential opportunities for profit in the long term.

About $187 million, or 94% of the total flows, went to Bitcoin. Total assets under management now stand at $37 billion — the highest since before the collapse of Three Arrows Capital, the data shows.'}, {'id': 33, 'time': 'Mon, 26 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Bitcoin Offshoot Has More Than Doubled Over The Last Week - Bloomberg', 'content': 'Bitcoin Cash, one of the early offshoots of the original digital currency, has more than doubled in value over the past week.\n\nThe surge began after a new crypto exchange backed by firms including Citadel Securities, Fidelity Digital Assets and Charles Schwab Corp. said it’s gone live.

Two wallets holding 50 BTC each, mined back in 2010, were moved to different wallets.\n\nIt is unclear who the owners of the cryptocurrency are but they are the sixth and seventh whales to have moved large quantities of BTC this year.\n\nThe movements come as the price of the largest digital asset soars following renewed institutional investor interest. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up nearly 15% in seven days, trading hands for $30,381, according to CoinGecko.\n\nThe term "whales" refers to investors who hoard huge amounts of Bitcoin and don’t touch it for years.\n\nSuch investors—also known as “HODLers”—are the most successful. Those who buy BTC and sell it quickly usually lose out, while those who buy it and sit on it for years tend to make a profit.\n\nThis is because Bitcoin experiences short-term volatility but in the long-term its price has appreciated massively. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap back in July 2010 was worth a fraction of a cent.\n\nDr. Kirill Kretov, a developer of tools for automated trading and blockchain analyst, previously told Decrypt that Bitcoin mined back in 2010 was probably down to computer experts experimenting with the technology but that it was hard to know whether the Bitcoin had since landed in the hands of commercial entities.\n\n"There is this unique spirit of crypto anarchy and technological pioneering behind such elder addresses," Kretov told Decrypt. "It\'s like a way-back machine, and thousands of people are left to speculate about why those bitcoins were transferred now."\n\nHe also mentioned that there\'s a theory that "elder" whale wallets shift BTC to send each other signals about when it\'s time to pump the price of the world\'s oldest and largest cryptocurrency.\n\n"There are some researchers who take notes on price charts about those awakenings, trying to predict the future price," he said. "Luckily, I\'m not one of those."\n\nStory continues\n\nOther whale movements include a holder in April who hadn’t touched their coins for a decade shuffling $7.8 million-worth of BTC to new wallets.\n\nNumber of Bitcoin Whales Drops to Lowest Level Since 2019\n\nAnd just last week, a long-term investor moved 50 BTC after 11 years of inactivity to a new wallet.'}, {'id': 18, 'time': 'Mon, 26 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Wall Street backing crypto in bitcoin ETF push - Yahoo Finance', 'content': "Wall Street players are now backing crypto as institutional investors show support for bitcoin ETFs. Yahoo Finance crypto reporter David Hollerith checks out bitcoin's year-to-date performance and the outlook for bitcoin ETF approval.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n[AUDIO LOGO]\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: Crypto prices lower today but momentum has been strong this year. And now some of the biggest names in finance are making new bets on cryptocurrencies adding competition and momentum to the space. Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith has more on that story. And David, nothing like a boost of confidence from Wall Street to get investors bullish on crypto again.\n\nDAVID HOLLERITH: Akiko, the big finance player moves that we've seen in the last two weeks obviously started with BlackRock filing an ETF. We also saw ETX markets begin trading. And they're backed by Fidelity Charles Schwab and Citadel Securities. And that's a new crypto exchange that doesn't interact with individuals but serves more like a traditional exchange.\n\nAnd then we have Deutsche Bank also applying to custody crypto assets. And outside of BlackRock, a lot of these moves were previously telegraphed as far back as a year. But obviously, this came at a really good time, I guess you would say for the space, just given that a lot of this year so far the story has been regulatory enforcements in the US leading to lawsuits. And that's still a lot of what we're looking at to determine where things are going.\n\nRegulation, of course, in the US is a really big deal. But we've seen obviously-- the Bitcoin price has surged a lot and then the total crypto market cap has followed along with that. And we've seen even just higher inflows into Bitcoin associated exchange traded products. So there's a lot of enthusiasm about this. Most of it actually was previously reported but I think that it highlights-- it's a reminder that cryptocurrency hasn't gone away as much as it might seem sometimes.\n\nAnd we see earlier this month, in fact, the SEC filing charges against the two largest crypto exchanges in the world.\n\nStory continues\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: And David, to that point, at least up until this point when you take into account the massive run that we've seen in the price of Bitcoin up what about 80% year to date. It hasn't yet had a massive impact but I guess you can make the argument that it's coming off a very depressed level after the implosion of FTX. But what do you think are the key things that investors need to watch for when they're trying to figure out where Bitcoin, where crypto is headed in the second half?\n\nDAVID HOLLERITH: Yeah. Always a good question. I think it's fair to think about it this way, which is that regulation has really dominated cryptocurrency asset prices. Maybe Bitcoin the least but still Bitcoin has sagged on bad regulatory news. So regulation is still going to be a major focus. But as things get cleared up, at least I think with the BlackRock and ETX announcements, there's a signal that US businesses or financial institutions, I should say, are still interested in getting involved in the space.\n\nAnd I think that brushes aside some of it. That being said, from what I've heard from crypto hopefuls in Washington, it sounds like there are two bills that are getting ready to be voted on in the House in July. And I've heard optimistically that one of those two bills could be passed in the House by the end of the year. There's a lot less optimism for what could happen in the Senate.\n\nAnd then that being said, the most important lawsuit as far as the ETF goes is the Grayscale lawsuit. Grayscale is suing the SEC for not approving its spot Bitcoin ETF or approving a conversion of its existing product. So the verdict for that case comes out at the beginning of September, and that's going to be really important. And we don't have the exact information, we don't know, but it'd be hard to imagine that the SEC would even consider approving an ETF before that verdict is reached.\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: I know you'll be following those developments closely, David Hollerith, thank you."}]

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
The recent surge in digital asset inflows, particularly in Bitcoin, following BlackRock's spot-Bitcoin ETF filing and the launch of EDX Markets, backed by major firms like Citadel Securities and Fidelity Digital Assets, indicates a growing interest in cryptocurrencies among institutional investors. Additionally, the movement of long-dormant whale wallets and Wall Street's increasing involvement in the crypto space through ETF filings and custody services suggest a positive market sentiment.

"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing a downward trend, as indicated by the sell signal on the MACD indicator. Despite some fluctuations in transaction metrics, the overall sentiment remains bearish. 

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights a mix of positive and negative news in the cryptocurrency market. While there are positive indicators such as Bitcoin reaching its highest level in a year and the launch of a double-Bitcoin ETF, there are also negative factors like the Twitter hacker's sentencing and market corrections.

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a cautious and informed approach prioritizing long-term profitability is crucial in navigating the current market conditions. By monitoring key indicators like the MACD signal and staying informed on market trends through news analysis, traders can make strategic decisions to manage risks effectively.

In conclusion, the overall market trend for ETH appears to be bearish in the short term, but there are potential positive catalysts that could drive market sentiment upwards in the long term. Therefore, it is advisable to adopt a conservative trading approach to capitalize on potential upward trends while mitigating losses.

Based on the synthesized reports and the emphasis on long-term strategies, I would take a slightly bearish stance with a trading action of -0.3, reflecting a moderate level of confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.

REASONING:
After reviewing the reports from the on-chain analyst, news analyst, and reflection analyst, it is clear that there are mixed signals in the market. The on-chain analyst report indicates a bullish sentiment with increasing activity and value transferred on the ETH network, but caution is advised due to the sell signal on the MACD. The news analyst report highlights positive market sentiment driven by the surge in Bitcoin's price and growing institutional interest in cryptocurrencies. However, the reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a cautious and informed approach to trading in the current volatile market conditions.

Taking into consideration the mixed signals and the emphasis on long-term profitability, it is prudent to adopt a conservative trading strategy. While short-term gains may be tempting, prioritizing long-term profitability and risk management is crucial in navigating the uncertainties of the cryptocurrency market.

Therefore, I would take a slightly cautious approach and make a trading action of 0.3, indicating moderate confidence in the market trend. This decision reflects a balanced approach that considers both the bullish sentiment in the market and the potential risks highlighted in the reports. By prioritizing long-term profitability and staying informed on market trends, I aim to maximize my overall profit while managing risks effectively.

The total value transferred has shown some variability, with peaks at 180401921.04641435 and 179496668.0784384, while the total size used has also fluctuated. The number of unique addresses and total transactions have shown slight increases, indicating continued interest and activity in the market. However, the overall trend suggests a bearish sentiment, with potential for further price declines in the near future.

This innovative platform aims to alter the way individuals and businesses comprehend the fundamental workings of Bitcoin by giving a comprehensive view of its liquidity and exclusive monitoring of changes.\n\nBitcoin’s dominant market position makes it an essential starting point for anybody exploring the cryptocurrency market. It’s a springboard for learning everything about the fascinating nuances of the crypto domain. Bitcoin gives investors a solid foundation to explore the vast crypto environment and discover its untapped possibilities.\n\nIn addition, Bitcoin is the initial gateway for numerous investors stepping into the realm of cryptocurrencies. Being the most widely recognized and adopted digital currency, Bitcoin garners a significant portion of the liquidity within the cryptocurrency space. Consequently, any alterations or developments concerning Bitcoin directly and immediately impact the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.\n\nHowever, it is often underestimated that risks exist not only within decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols but also within Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 2 (L2) networks, especially when combined with DeFi protocols. To illustrate this point, let’s consider the example of a significant price drop. Such an event can have an impact not just on DeFi protocols but also on the underlying L1 and L2 networks. Understanding the significance of L1 networks becomes crucial in this context.\n\nThe Solity Network platform offers a comprehensive and real-time Bitcoin Insights Dashboard to address this interconnectedness. This tool provides users with up-to-date data and in-depth analysis of the evolving dynamics of Bitcoin. Furthermore, by presenting a comprehensive overview of Bitcoin’s liquidity, the dashboard empowers users to monitor fluctuations and correlations within the cryptocurrency market closely. This capability enhances risk assessment and facilitates informed decision-making within the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn a statement by Marijo Radman, the CTO and Co-Founder of Solity Network, he mentioned: “For DeFi to go mainstream the underlying dynamics of Bitcoin and its interconnectedness to the DeFi space have to be understood in depth. The Bitcoin Insights Dashboard is the first step in that direction. Our mission is to create more transparency and make it accessible to everyone to foster DeFi adoption.”\n\nWith the Bitcoin Insights Dashboard launch, Solity Network solidifies its position as an industry leader in blockchain risk solutions. The company’s dedication to innovation and the advancement of the crypto landscape propels them to develop groundbreaking tools that enable investors to navigate the complexities of decentralized finance.\n\nAbout Solity Network\n\nSolity Network provides the infrastructure for Decentralized Finance to enable the real-time processing of fundamental risks across chains, protocols, and liquidity pools. By aggregating multi-chain risk parameters, Solity Network creates transparency, sets the stage for machine learning, and implements risk-adjusted returns for digital assets investment managers.\n\nDisclaimer: There is no offer to sell, no solicitation of an offer to buy, and no recommendation of any security or any other product or service in this article.

What Does This Mean For Ethereum & Altcoins like Caged Beasts? - Yahoo Finance", 'content': 'As the bull market gains momentum and Bitcoin’s (BTC) price continues to surge, the spotlight is shining on altcoins and their potential to follow in Bitcoin’s footsteps. Following unveiling the private Bitcoin Trust in August last year, BlackRock’s (BLK) iShares lodged with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) yesterday to launch a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nWith Bitcoin’s price skyrocketing by 4.5% in the last 24-hr, the highest since April, investors are becoming more optimistic about the likelihood of BlackRock and other institutional players investing in digital assets. What could this mean for Bitcoin? Will Ethereum (ETH) follow in the footsteps of Bitcoin, and how much of it affect other altcoins such as Caged Beasts (BEASTS)? Let’s discuss and learn all about it.\n\nBlack Rock Bitcoin ETF: The Gateway to Mainstream Adoption\n\nThe Black Rock Bitcoin ETF has attracted significant interest within the financial realm as an exchange-traded fund that focuses exclusively on Bitcoin. By investing in this ETF, individuals can benefit from Bitcoin’s price fluctuations without possessing the actual cryptocurrency, meaning the risk is less. This ETF effectively connects conventional finance with cryptocurrencies, appealing to institutional investors and those desiring a regulated investment option.\n\nComparing Black Rock Bitcoin ETF with direct cryptocurrency ownership has various benefits. First off, it offers simplicity and accessibility that attracts a broader spectrum of investors. Some security issues with traditional Bitcoin exchanges are reduced when trading on licensed exchanges. Additionally, the ETF structure promotes liquidity and transparency, attracting institutional investors who have previously hesitated to enter the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe significance of the Black Rock Bitcoin ETF lies in its potential to accelerate the adoption of Bitcoin among mainstream investors. Introducing a regulated investment vehicle tied to Bitcoin reduces barriers to entry and establishes a sense of trust and legitimacy in the market. This development could lead to increased institutional participation, which may contribute to the long-term stability and growth of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nStory continues\n\nEthereum: The Catalyst for Altcoin Season\n\nThe efficiency and adaptability of Ethereum render it a desirable investment prospect. As the foundation of countless DApps and digital initiatives, Ethereum has become a dominant force in the cryptocurrency industry. Thanks to its robust infrastructure and vibrant developer community, the Ethereum platform is constantly improving and innovating. Ethereum is likely to be an accurate store of value, and its staking functionality makes it possible to earn passive revenue.\n\nWhile Bitcoin’s price movements often dominate headlines, Ethereum has the potential to act as a catalyst for altcoin surges. After a 2-day short struggle with altcoins such as Cardano and Chainlink, they have returned to their position. As the second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum’s price movements often influence the overall sentiment and performance of the altcoin market. Ethereum can create a domino effect, driving up the value of other altcoins. This presents investors with opportunities to capitalize on the growth potential of various altcoins.\n\nCaged Beasts: The Altcoin You Need\n\nIn the realm of altcoins, meme coins have gained considerable attention due to their unique appeal and community-driven nature. Caged Beasts is an emerging meme coin that has captured the imagination of crypto enthusiasts worldwide. With a focus on community engagement and utility, Caged Beasts aim to stand out in a crowded market and establish itself as a force to be reckoned with.\n\nTheir referral bonus provides an additional 20% on Tether (USDT) tokens, increasing the potential for passive income generation. And owing to a novel referral program, early investors are able to go on an exhilarating journey with these additional advantages. Caged Beasts have piqued people’s interest with their attractive staking incentives and alluring memes by creating a thriving ecosystem and encouraging a sense of belonging among investors. Given its numerous positive elements, Caged Beasts have the ability to transform how meme currencies are used.\n\nBlack Rock Bitcoin ETF’s emergence as a regulated investment vehicle for Bitcoin paves the way for mainstream adoption and opens doors for institutional investors. Ethereum’s position as a leading blockchain platform and influence on altcoin performance highlights its significance in the crypto market. Meanwhile, Caged Beasts represent meme coins’ creative and community-driven nature with utility, appealing to investors seeking unique and engaging opportunities.\n\nCaged Beasts Website: https://cagedbeasts.com\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CAGED_BEASTS\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/CAGEDBEASTS'}, {'id': 6, 'time': 'Tue, 27 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Speculation mounts BlackRock bitcoin ETF will get green light - Financial Times', 'content': 'Print this page\n\nSpeculation that BlackRock will finally break the US regulators’ decade-long resistance to exchange traded funds based on bitcoin has fuelled a rally in the token to its highest level in a year.\n\nOptimism among crypto traders has soared in the two weeks since the world’s largest money manager filed an application to run the first publicly traded spot bitcoin ETF in the US. Bitcoin, the most popular digital token, has soared by a fifth to more than $30,000.\n\nBlackRock’s application has pitted a group with a substantial record of ETF approvals against the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has repeatedly rejected industry efforts for an ETF based on trading in the underlying bitcoin asset.\n\nSupporters argue a cheap and regulated asset in the world’s largest investment market would encourage more investors and hope the financial muscle of the asset manager will succeed where others have failed. The SEC has three months to assess the application.\n\n“The BlackRock ETF is likely to be approved,” said Dave Weisberger, chief executive and co-founder of CoinRoutes, an algorithmic trading platform for the digital asset industry.\n\n\n\nBlackRock has “pretty much undercut all the SEC’s arguments other than ‘meh, we don’t like bitcoin’, so I think they have a very reasonable chance,” he added.\n\nDozens of asset managers have applied to launch such a fund since the Winklevoss twins, the entrepreneurs, made the first filing in 2013, when bitcoin was trading at about $1,000.\n\nDigital assets dashboard Click here for real-time data on crypto prices and insights\n\nThe SEC has yet to pass an application for an ETF based on the underlying bitcoin asset, which is traded on unregulated exchanges. The agency says it cannot offer investors guarantees the market is free from fraud and manipulation.\n\n\n\nThe only crypto-ETFs the US has approved are based on bitcoin futures contracts, which are listed and monitored on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a regulated market.\n\nBoth ETF and crypto markets are hoping to ride in BlackRock’s slipstream. Invesco, WisdomTree, Bitwise, Ark Investment Management and Valkyrie have all had spot bitcoin ETF filings rejected in the past but have refiled their applications, with some modifications. Ark is ahead of BlackRock in the filing queue, with the SEC due to make a ruling on its application by August 13.\n\nThe discount to the net asset value of the $18.9bn Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the world’s largest crypto fund, has narrowed sharply to a nine-month low of 31.3 per cent. Grayscale is suing the SEC for its refusal to allow it to convert GBTC into an ETF, a move that, if allowed, would probably see the discount disappear.\n\nPart of the optimism stems from BlackRock’s formidable record. According to Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, the asset manager has had 575 filings approved by the SEC and only one rejection. He put the odds of approval on this occasion at 50-50. Both BlackRock and the SEC declined to comment.\n\nIts application is also subtly different from those that have gone before. The chief difference is that the Nasdaq exchange, where the iShares Bitcoin Trust would be listed, “is expecting to enter into a surveillance-sharing agreement with an operator of a United States-based spot trading platform for bitcoin”.\n\nIn previous rejections the SEC has said a deal on surveillance “with a regulated market of significant size” was one way for an applicant to meet its obligations to prevent fraud and manipulation in the underlying market.\n\nCoinbase is the proposed custodian for the fund and widely expected to be BlackRock’s chosen exchange.\n\n“If Nasdaq is able to enter into an agreement with an exchange such as Coinbase, that could theoretically clear a pathway towards approval since it would directly address the SEC’s main concern”, allowing regulators “to monitor for and pursue bad actors”, said Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store, a financial adviser.\n\nHowever, Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research, North America, at Morningstar, felt BlackRock was only “edging closer to addressing [the SEC’s] concerns”.\n\nWhile a surveillance-sharing effort with a cryptocurrency exchange “is certainly better than having zero insight into the underlying market”, he argued that manipulation could still be occurring on other exchanges, which would influence the price of bitcoin.\n\nGeraci suggested the new EDX Markets exchange, which launched this week, “could be the exact solution needed to get the SEC comfortable”.\n\nThe marketplace is backed by Fidelity Investments, Charles Schwab and Citadel Securities and only allows accredited members to trade on it, much like Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange. But Geraci admitted it needed to generate sufficient volume for the SEC to consider it as “significant size”.\n\nMoreover, the SEC also sued Coinbase this month, alleging it violated US securities law by failing to register as a broker, national secur...'}]

"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the reports from the on-chain analyst, news analyst, and reflection analyst, it is clear that there are mixed signals in the market. The on-chain analyst report indicates a bullish sentiment with increasing activity and value transferred on the ETH network, but caution is advised due to the sell signal on the MACD. The news analyst report highlights positive market sentiment driven by the surge in Bitcoin's price and growing institutional interest in cryptocurrencies. However, the reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a cautious and informed approach to trading in the current volatile market conditions.

Taking into consideration the mixed signals and the emphasis on long-term profitability, it is prudent to adopt a conservative trading strategy. While short-term gains may be tempting, prioritizing long-term profitability and risk management is crucial in navigating the uncertainties of the cryptocurrency market.

Therefore, I would take a slightly cautious approach and make a trading action of 0.3, indicating moderate confidence in the market trend. This decision reflects a balanced approach that considers both the bullish sentiment in the market and the potential risks highlighted in the reports. By prioritizing long-term profitability and staying informed on market trends, I aim to maximize my overall profit while managing risks effectively.

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing a downward trend, as indicated by the sell signals from the MACD indicator and the fluctuating total value transferred and total size used for transactions. This suggests a bearish sentiment in the short term.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights positive developments in the cryptocurrency market, such as the approval of the first leveraged Bitcoin futures ETF and increased involvement of major financial institutions. These events indicate a growing interest and acceptance of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, which could lead to a bullish market trend in the near future.

In reflecting on the reports, it is important to adopt a cautious and informed approach that prioritizes long-term profitability. While short-term gains may be tempting, it is crucial to consider the overall market trend and potential future developments.

Considering the mixed signals in the market, it is advisable to maintain a conservative trading strategy that balances bullish sentiment with risk management. By staying informed on key indicators, market trends, and adopting a long-term perspective, traders can effectively navigate the uncertainties and fluctuations in the cryptocurrency market.

Based on the synthesized reports, I would recommend a conservative trading action with a confidence level of 0.3. This reflects a cautious approach to managing risk while still being open to potential opportunities for profit in the long term.

REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the ETH market is currently experiencing a bearish trend with sell signals in the MACD indicator, fluctuating open prices, decreasing total transactions, and increasing average fees. This indicates a potential decrease in trading activity and uncertainty in market sentiment.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights a positive market sentiment for cryptocurrencies, including ETH, due to the growing interest from institutional investors, regulatory clarity, and potential ETF approvals. The involvement of major firms and the movement of long-dormant whale wallets suggest a bullish trend in the near term.

In reflection, it is clear that a cautious and informed approach to trading has been effective in managing risks and maximizing long-term profitability. While short-term gains may be tempting, a conservative trading strategy is essential in navigating the current volatile market conditions and prioritizing long-term profitability.

Considering the mixed signals from the reports, it is important to balance the bearish on-chain indicators with the bullish news sentiment. Therefore, a conservative trading approach with a focus on long-term strategies is recommended.

But it’s been on a roll this month: since the start of June, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is up 98%, jumping from $113 to $224.\n\nThe slightly obscure digital asset—one of many cryptocurrency “forks”—is following Bitcoin, like many other coins and tokens which have surged in price since the biggest digital asset experienced a run. But BCH is doing by far the best.\n\nWhy? The coin is one of the lucky four chosen for EDX Markets, a new crypto exchange backed by major Wall Street players Charles Schwab, Citadel Securities, and Fidelity Digital Assets.\n\nEDX, which launched last week, decided to let its traders—institutional investors only—start off with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash.\n\nThe reason is simple: regulatory clarity.\n\n“These specific cryptocurrencies are generally perceived as commodities by regulatory bodies, which significantly mitigates potential legal challenges,” Sei Labs co-founder Jeff Feng told Decrypt.\n\nYouwei Yang, Chief Economist at BTCM, added that the four assets are “widely regarded as digital commodities, making them relatively safe” from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission because they are made with electricity—a commodity.\n\nIn perhaps its toughest regulatory crackdown yet, the SEC has gone after a number of major crypto brands for allegedly flogging unregistered securities. Earlier this month, it went after Coinbase for allegedly offering and selling unregistered securities via its staking service. It also targeted Binance, the world’s biggest exchange, with a massive lawsuit for allegedly “operating as a fking [sic] unlicensed securities exchange in the U.S.A. bro,” according to the SEC.\n\nIn February, it hit Kraken with a $30 million fine for allegedly failing to register the offer and sale of its crypto asset staking-as-a-service program.\n\nEvery Crypto Project Must Reckon With the SEC's Howey Test\n\nStory continues\n\nThese regulatory enforcements are all because SEC Chairman Gary Gensler thinks—and has said for years—that most cryptocurrencies are unregistered securities.\n\nBut he has made it clear that Bitcoin is a commodity. He has been less clear on Ethereum, but the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CTFC) has said the asset is a commodity.\n\nAnd Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin are both Bitcoin forks—new cryptocurrencies that emerged from the asset’s original code—meaning they are likely to have the same status in the eyes of regulators.\n\nGreg Moritz, Co-Founder at the crypto hedge fund AltTab Capital, said that “none have been listed by the SEC as unregistered securities,” adding that all four assets are established and have history, “key factors in the decision-making process of EDX’s backers.”\n\nEDX Markets CEO Jamil Nazarali also said that he felt “very comfortable” that the four assets weren’t securities.\n\nFor now, these four “old school” cryptocurrencies will give “old school” investors a taste of the crypto world. But things could change, Feng noted. “As regulations evolve and the understanding of different cryptocurrencies becomes more nuanced, we could anticipate exchanges like EDX broadening their offerings,” he added."}]

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing a downward trend, as indicated by the sell signals from the MACD indicator and the fluctuating total value transferred and total size used for transactions. This suggests a bearish sentiment in the short term.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights positive developments in the cryptocurrency market, such as the approval of the first leveraged Bitcoin futures ETF and increased involvement of major financial institutions. These events indicate a growing interest and acceptance of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, which could lead to a bullish market trend in the near future.

In reflecting on the reports, it is important to adopt a cautious and informed approach that prioritizes long-term profitability. While short-term gains may be tempting, it is crucial to consider the overall market trend and potential future developments.

Considering the mixed signals in the market, it is advisable to maintain a conservative trading strategy that balances bullish sentiment with risk management. By staying informed on key indicators, market trends, and adopting a long-term perspective, traders can effectively navigate the uncertainties and fluctuations in the cryptocurrency market.

Based on the synthesized reports, I would recommend a conservative trading action with a confidence level of 0.3. This reflects a cautious approach to managing risk while still being open to potential opportunities for profit in the long term.

REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the ETH market is currently experiencing a bearish trend with sell signals in the MACD indicator, fluctuating open prices, decreasing total transactions, and increasing average fees. This indicates a potential decrease in trading activity and uncertainty in market sentiment.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights a positive market sentiment for cryptocurrencies, including ETH, due to the growing interest from institutional investors, regulatory clarity, and potential ETF approvals. The involvement of major firms and the movement of long-dormant whale wallets suggest a bullish trend in the near term.

In reflection, it is clear that a cautious and informed approach to trading has been effective in managing risks and maximizing long-term profitability. While short-term gains may be tempting, a conservative trading strategy is essential in navigating the current volatile market conditions and prioritizing long-term profitability.

Considering the mixed signals from the reports, it is important to balance the bearish on-chain indicators with the bullish news sentiment. Therefore, a conservative trading approach with a focus on long-term strategies is recommended. I would assign a trading action of 0.3, reflecting a moderate confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.

The exchange has made similar filings for other firms over the past two weeks.\n\nThe SEC has so far rejected every spot bitcoin fund application on which it has made a decision.

But many of the crypto-curious still view buying Bitcoin from a crypto exchange as an intimidating and opaque process. The technical aspects of holding Bitcoin—such as crypto wallets, Bitcoin addresses and private keys—are confusing to newcomers, and scare some investors away.\n\nAll of this has intensified the appeal of a Bitcoin ETF, or exchange-traded fund. Major financial institutions like Blackrock, Fidelity, and Invesco have applied with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch ETFs.\n\nWhat is an ETF?\n\n💸 An ETF is an investment vehicle that is publicly traded, like a stock, but tracks the performance of an underlying asset or index, rather than one company.\n\n🛢️ An ETF is a way for investors to get exposure to the value of its underlying asset, like gold or oil.\n\n📈 ETFs trade on a traditional stock exchange, and their value should rise when the asset increases in price, and fall when it decreases.\n\nSEC Approves First Leveraged Bitcoin Futures ETF\n\nThe first ETF launched in 1993, and they became popular as a way for retail investors to invest in a basket of assets at once.

This may mean buying a hardware wallet to protect purchased Bitcoin, or storing private keys in a secure manner. You’d also have to work out how to file taxes for sales of Bitcoin that resulted in capital gains.\n\nHow To File Your Crypto Taxes In The U.S.\n\nWith a Bitcoin ETF, investors need not worry about private keys, storage, or security. They own shares in the ETF just like their shares of stock, and can gain exposure to the cryptocurrency market without having to go through the hoops of purchasing and holding crypto.\n\nAnd to put it plainly, that is an extremely appealing proposition for many regular folks—as well as sophisticated institutional investors.\n\nThat\'s why so many hedge funds and other investment firms have filed applications with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for Bitcoin ETFs. Gemini founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss were first out of the gate with an application for the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust in 2013. In 2018, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office awarded the Winklevoss brothers a patent for “exchange-traded products." But the SEC still hasn\'t approved their ETF—or any others.\n\nHow does a Bitcoin ETF work?\n\nA Bitcoin ETF is managed by a firm that buys and holds the actual Bitcoin; the price is pegged to the Bitcoin held in the fund. The firm lists the ETF on a traditional stock exchange, and you, the investor, trade the ETF just as you would any other stock. Bitcoin ETFs also offer new types of trading opportunities, including short-selling, where investors can bet against Bitcoin.\n\nBut there are also some key differences between a Bitcoin ETF and other ETFs.\n\nFirst, some ETFs, like those that track the S&P 500, represent equity shares, so you get a cut of the dividends that any company in the ETF pay to their shareholders. When Tesla pays a dividend and you have shares in an ETF that includes Tesla, you get a (smaller) dividend. Bitcoin is decentralized, so that won\'t happen with a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nSecond, just like with other ETFs, you have to pay fees to the company offering the ETF. But with a Bitcoin ETF, some portion of your fees would go to paying the custody and management fees for the purchase and storage of the Bitcoin that underlies the ETF.\n\nA brief history of Bitcoin ETF progress\n\nWhat’s so special about a Bitcoin ETF?\n\nA Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. is expected to bring a new level of mainstream trustworthiness and acceptance to B...'}]

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
The recent surge in interest from major financial institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark Invest in launching Bitcoin ETFs indicates a growing acceptance and mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin. The filing of spot Bitcoin ETFs by these firms, along with the SEC's approval of leveraged Bitcoin futures ETFs, has contributed to a positive sentiment in the market, leading to a rise in Bitcoin prices. The potential approval of Bitcoin ETFs could further boost investor confidence and drive increased investment in the cryptocurrency market, potentially leading to a bullish trend for Ethereum (ETH) as well.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the ETH market is currently experiencing a bearish trend with sell signals in the MACD indicator, fluctuating open prices, decreasing total transactions, and increasing average fees. This indicates a potential decrease in trading activity and uncertainty in market sentiment.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights a positive market sentiment for cryptocurrencies, including ETH, due to the growing interest from institutional investors, regulatory clarity, and potential ETF approvals. The involvement of major firms and the movement of long-dormant whale wallets suggest a bullish trend in the near term.

In reflection, it is clear that a cautious and informed approach to trading has been effective in managing risks and maximizing long-term profitability. While short-term gains may be tempting, a conservative trading strategy is essential in navigating the current volatile market conditions and prioritizing long-term profitability.

Considering the mixed signals from the reports, it is important to balance the bearish on-chain indicators with the bullish news sentiment. Therefore, a conservative trading approach with a focus on long-term strategies is recommended. I would assign a trading action of 0.3, reflecting a moderate confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.
ACTION:
0.3
DAILY RETURN:
0.008914699174894958
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing a bearish sentiment with potential for further price declines. The sell signals from the MACD indicator and the fluctuating total value transferred indicate a lack of strong buying pressure in the market.

On the other hand, the news analyst report suggests a bullish trend in the overall cryptocurrency market, with growing interest in Bitcoin ETFs and positive developments that could boost investor confidence. The emergence of meme coins and Ethereum's role in driving altcoin surges also indicate a dynamic and innovative market environment.

In reflection, it is evident that a cautious and informed trading approach has been effective in managing risks and maximizing profitability. By balancing the bearish on-chain indicators with the bullish news sentiment, strategic decisions can be made to navigate market uncertainties effectively.

Considering the mixed signals in the market, it is important to prioritize long-term profitability and risk management over short-term gains. Therefore, a conservative trading approach with a focus on long-term strategies is warranted to ensure success in the current volatile market conditions.

Based on the synthesized reports, I would take a slightly bearish stance on the market trend with a trading action of -0.3, reflecting a moderate level of confidence in the bearish sentiment and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately for long-term profitability.
ACTION:
-0.3
DAILY RETURN:
-0.010396896516711718
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently bearish, with a downward trend indicated by the sell signal on the MACD indicator. The open prices have been fluctuating around $30,000, and there has been a slight decrease in total transactions and unique addresses. This suggests a potential for further price declines in the near future.

On the other hand, the news analyst report paints a more optimistic picture for the cryptocurrency market in general, with growing interest and investment in Bitcoin and positive developments such as the launch of EDX Markets. This indicates potential for further growth in the market, particularly for Bitcoin and the listed assets on EDX Markets.

Reflecting on the mixed signals from the on-chain and news analyst reports, it is evident that a cautious and informed approach is necessary to balance risks and maximize profitability. Long-term strategies should be prioritized over short-term gains to navigate the current volatile market conditions effectively.

Considering the synthesized reports, I would conclude that while there are conflicting signals in the market, a conservative trading approach with a focus on risk management is warranted. It is important to remain vigilant and adaptable to changing market trends to ensure continued success in cryptocurrency trading.

Therefore, my trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.5, reflecting my cautious approach in light of the bearish on-chain signals and the need to manage risks effectively in the current market environment.

*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that there is a bearish sentiment in the ETH market, with indicators pointing towards potential further price declines. The MACD signal on sell and the fluctuations in various on-chain metrics suggest a lack of strong positive momentum in the near future. 

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights a more positive sentiment in the overall cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin showing gains and the filing of spot Bitcoin ETF applications by major firms. However, the caution expressed by the SEC regarding these filings has introduced some uncertainty into the market.

In light of these reports, it is important to take a cautious and informed approach to trading ETH. While short-term gains may be possible, the overall market trend seems to favor a more conservative and long-term strategy. By balancing the bearish on-chain signals with the positive news sentiment, traders can make strategic decisions to manage risks effectively.

Therefore, I would recommend taking a conservative approach and focusing on long-term strategies rather than short-term gains. My trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.7, reflecting a moderate level of confidence in the bearish market trend and the importance of managing risk appropriately.

"The European regulators have been more friendly, and they\'ve been able to get comfortable with the mechanisms, the custodians [and] how the markets work."\n\nThe SEC rejected WisdomTree\'s previous applications in 2021 and 2022 on the notion they came in short to protect investors and the public interest.\n\nSchwartz hopes the changes made in the firm\'s updated filing will satisfy regulators.\n\n"Some of the new filings have these data sharing agreements, surveillance sharing, new ways of doing it," he said. "Now the question is: Will that address the SEC\'s concern on market manipulation? But that is one of the things I think we\'re all trying to address."\n\nWisdomTree\'s latest launch effort comes during an increased appetite for bitcoin . As of late Friday, prices are up almost 84% so far this year.\n\n"It\'s hard for me to comment too much about all the details while you\'re in these [filing] periods," Schwartz said when "ETF Edge" host Bob Pisani asked him why he thinks the SEC will approve the spot bitcoin ETF this time. "But I think the key is, will the exchanges share data … and [will the SEC] have more comfort than what was previously done before? I think the data sharing agreements are the key element for that."\n\nIt appears interest is climbing.\n\nAccording to an SEC filing this week, Fidelity Investments is also trying to launch a spot bitcoin ETF despite its prior failures.

Trading platforms popular with retail investors, such as Robinhood, are moving to end support for trading these tokens, and the risk of an SEC crackdown has made institutional investors even more leery of them.'}]

The news articles suggest a growing interest in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency ETFs among institutional investors, with companies like WisdomTree, BlackRock, and Fidelity making efforts to launch spot bitcoin ETFs. This institutional interest is solidifying Bitcoin's position as the top player in the cryptocurrency market, leading to a surge in Bitcoin's price and market capitalization.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently bearish, with a downward trend indicated by the sell signal on the MACD indicator. The open prices have been fluctuating around $30,000, and there has been a slight decrease in total transactions and unique addresses. This suggests a potential for further price declines in the near future.

On the other hand, the news analyst report paints a more optimistic picture for the cryptocurrency market in general, with growing interest and investment in Bitcoin and positive developments such as the launch of EDX Markets. This indicates potential for further growth in the market, particularly for Bitcoin and the listed assets on EDX Markets.

Reflecting on the mixed signals from the on-chain and news analyst reports, it is evident that a cautious and informed approach is necessary to balance risks and maximize profitability. Long-term strategies should be prioritized over short-term gains to navigate the current volatile market conditions effectively.

Considering the synthesized reports, I would conclude that while there are conflicting signals in the market, a conservative trading approach with a focus on risk management is warranted. It is important to remain vigilant and adaptable to changing market trends to ensure continued success in cryptocurrency trading.

Therefore, my trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.5, reflecting my cautious approach in light of the bearish on-chain signals and the need to manage risks effectively in the current market environment.
ACTION:
-0.5
DAILY RETURN:
0.0018100116696171398
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market has been experiencing a downward trend with sell signals from the MACD indicator, fluctuating open prices, decreasing total transactions, and inconsistent total value transferred. This indicates a bearish market sentiment in the short term.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights a positive sentiment in the market due to the growing acceptance and mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin. The potential approval of Bitcoin ETFs could lead to increased investment in the cryptocurrency market, potentially benefiting Ethereum (ETH) as well.

In reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a cautious and informed approach is necessary to balance the conflicting signals in the market. Prioritizing long-term strategies over short-term gains is crucial in navigating the volatile market conditions and maximizing profitability.

Considering the current market trend and the importance of risk management, I would take a conservative trading approach and hold my position in ETH for the long term. Therefore, my trading action would be 0.3, reflecting moderate confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.
ACTION:
0.3
DAILY RETURN:
-0.00048688338658886554
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that there is a bearish sentiment in the ETH market, with indicators pointing towards potential further price declines. The MACD signal on sell and the fluctuations in various on-chain metrics suggest a lack of strong positive momentum in the near future. 

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights a more positive sentiment in the overall cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin showing gains and the filing of spot Bitcoin ETF applications by major firms. However, the caution expressed by the SEC regarding these filings has introduced some uncertainty into the market.

In light of these reports, it is important to take a cautious and informed approach to trading ETH. While short-term gains may be possible, the overall market trend seems to favor a more conservative and long-term strategy. By balancing the bearish on-chain signals with the positive news sentiment, traders can make strategic decisions to manage risks effectively.

Therefore, I would recommend taking a conservative approach and focusing on long-term strategies rather than short-term gains. My trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.7, reflecting a moderate level of confidence in the bearish market trend and the importance of managing risk appropriately.
ACTION:
-0.7

While futures-based Bitcoin ETFs have since gotten a regulatory green light in the U.S., the SEC claims that no spot ETF arrangement thus far proposed does enough to protect investors from “fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices.”\n\nSo, on the first filing’s 10-year anniversary, Winklevoss called out the agency for supposedly dragging its feet, recognizing every other application for a spot-based Bitcoin ETF has been stifled as well.\n\n“The SEC\'s refusal to approve these products for a decade has been a complete and utter disaster for U.S. investors,” he said, adding that the agency’s reluctance “demonstrates how the SEC is a failed regulator.”\n\nToday marks 10 years since @tyler and I filed for the first spot Bitcoin ETF. The @SECGov\'s refusal to approve these products for a decade has been a complete and utter disaster for US investors and demonstrates how the SEC is a failed regulator. Here\'s why: -"protected"… pic.twitter.com/xmK1xo1iX8 — Cameron Winklevoss (@cameron) July 2, 2023\n\nThese failures, according to Winklevoss, include cutting investors off from the best investment opportunity of the past decade. Or, as Winklevoss puts it, keeping investors “protected” from exposure to Bitcoin.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs the crypto market recoiled after the SEC’s bombshell lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase on June 5, BlackRock’s gambit to establish a spot Bitcoin ETF two weeks later reignited optimism on Crypto Twitter and pushed Bitcoin higher. Capping off a wave of Bitcoin ETF applications from other firms that followed—including Invesco, Wisdom Tree, and Valkyrie—Fidelity threw its hat back into the ring last week.\n\nHowever, the SEC believes BlackRock and Fidelity’s recent Bitcoin ETF applications “aren’t sufficiently clear and comprehensive,” according to a report from the Wall Street Journal.\n\nWinklevoss asserts that the complete lack of options for spot Bitcoin ETFs has “pushed” U.S. investors toward Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust. Shares in Grayscale’s Bitcoin trust, launched in 2013, currently trade at a discount relative to its Bitcoin holdings due to shareholders’ inability to redeem their shares.\n\nWhile Winklevoss called the product “toxic,” he didn’t mention that converting Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust into an ETF would likely resolve this discount, and the firm is currently suing the SEC over repeated denials to do just that.\n\nWinklevoss has joined a chorus of critics who say SEC Chair Gary Gensler is pushing innovation offshore, and said the agency meanwhile thrust “investors into the arms of FTX” and made them victim “to one of the largest financial frauds in modern history.”\n\nSam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO and founder of FTX, has pleaded not guilty to a litany of charges he faces for conduct at the collapsed exchange, including fraud.\n\nSending investors abroad in search of Bitcoin exposure has also led them to do business with “unlicensed and unregulated venues,” Winklevoss claimed.\n\nGemini and the SEC are not on friendly terms. The regulatory agency accused Gemini of violating securities laws in January, alleging that its “Gemini Earn” product constitutes an unregistered securities offering. Retail investors could previously loan their crypto to the now-bankrupt firm Genesis—which was also charged by the SEC—in exchange for interest on deposits.\n\nSEC Calls BlackRock, Fidelity Bitcoin ETF Applications Inadequate: WSJ\n\nNotably, Genesis and Grayscale are both owned by Digital Currency Group. And Genesis and Gemini have been engaged in a spat over a $900 million loan that Gemini extended to the crypto lender.\n\nWinklevoss considered a lawsuit against DCG and company CEO Barry Silbert earlier this year, but Gemini, Genesis, and DCG reached an agreement “in principle” in February. However, Gemini said DCG missed a $630 million loan repayment this past month and risks defaulting on its obligations.\n\nWinklevoss expressed hope that the SEC will “reflect on its dismal record” and focus on its stated duties, “instead of overstepping its statutory power and trying to act like the gatekeeper of economic life.”\n\nAdditionally, Winklevoss ended his post with accolades for “all those fighting the good fight to bring U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs to life”—which, in practice, may preclude certain companies that have outstanding applications or lawsuits.'}, {'id': 3, 'time': 'Sun, 02 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Bitcoin flat, Ether gains in mixed crypto market; Solana rebounds, Litecoin leads winners - Yahoo Finance', 'content': 'Bitcoin traded little changed and Ether gained on Monday morning in Asia, with prices of most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies mixed.

After a jump that followed a raft of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications in the final weeks of June, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has lost direction, adding just 0.61% over the past seven days.\n\nThe U.S. regulator that approves ETFs, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), on Friday indicated it was unimpressed by the Bitcoin ETF applications by financial heavyweights such as Blackrock and Fidelity Investments, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nEther, the world’s second biggest token by market capitalization, added 1.49% to US$1,954.67. It’s gained 2.65% for the seven days.\n\nSolana was among the gainers in mixed early Asia trading for other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The token rose 5.48% to US$19.43 for a weekly gain of 14.47%.\n\nSolana is rallying after a raft of bearish indicators last week, with Solana-based non-fungible token (NFT) protocol Cardinal saying it was shutting down, citing “macroeconomic challenges.” The Revolut neobank and crypto exchange also reportedly told U.S.-based users last Wednesday that it will delist Solana, along with Cardano and Polygon.\n\nThe three tokens were among cryptocurrencies that the SEC named as illegally issued financial securities in its lawsuit filed last month against the Coinbase and Binance.US exchanges.\n\nVitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum wrote on Twitter on Friday that the tokens don’t deserve to be targeted. “If ethereum ends up “winning” through all other blockchains getting kicked off exchanges, that’s not an honorable way to win, and in the long term probably isn’t even a victory.”\n\nStory continues\n\nLitecoin led the gainers with a 6.37% increase in the last 24 hours to US$112.96. The token surged 27.98% in the past seven days.\n\nLitecoin, which was created in 2011 as a hard fork to Bitcoin, was one of the four tokens selected to trade on the EDX Markets exchange, which is backed by Citadel Securities and Fidelity Investments. The other tokens are Bitcoin, Ether and Bitcoin Cash. The New Jersey-based EDX opened for business despite the crackdown on crypto from U.S. regulators.\n\nThe California-based crypto exchange Kraken was ordered by a U.S. judge on Friday to submit information about its users to the Internal Revenue Service in an investigation of underreported tax liabilities. The crypto exchange was fined US$30 million in February by the SEC for its staking services, which the federal agency said were an offering of unregistered securities.\n\nOther crypto movers included Tron, which dipped 1.85% to US$0.07572, but gained 3.31% for the week. Binance’s BNB token edged down 0.31% to US$247.13, and Cardano’s ADA fell 0.13% to US$0.2905.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap edged up 0.02% to US$1.2 trillion, with trading volume dropping 7.54% to US$27.26 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nNFTs “brutal weekend”\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index fell 1.49% to 2,910.36 in the 24 hours to 7:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. The index is down 4.59% for the week.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume dipped 9.68% to US$28.3 million, while volume on Ethereum rose 3.12% to US$22.3 million.\n\n“Brutal weekend for NFTs,” said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News. “It might be easy to point to Azuki’s Elementals mint as the catalyst still, but lowering average sales and floor prices in top collections prior to Elementals mint showed that we were on the cusp of another free fall.”\n\nThe Azuki Elementals collection began minting last Tuesday and sold out in 15 minutes, but left collectors disappointed as the latest collection looked almost the same as the original.\n\nAzuki founder Alex Xu, who goes by the moniker Zagabond, met with its community last Thursday to address complaints about the mint and Elementals issued a public apology on Twitter, saying they “missed the mark” and that the new release diluted the value of the popular collection.\n\nEthereum-based Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs topped the volume ranking on Cryptoslam at US$3.87 million.

Don\'t get too carried away though – crypto is still part of the broader market, which remains in a challenging macro environment. The third quarter is historically the weakest for bitcoin. The average third-quarter gain going back to 2014 is just 4.67%, according to CoinGecko, and it\'s posted a positive third quarter for only four of the nine in its lifetime. Before the recent rush of applications to launch U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs injected new optimism in the crypto market, it was a frustrating second quarter for traders. Between the end of the banking crisis in May and the BlackRock bitcoin ETF filing on June 15, regulatory pressure weighed heavily on sentiment and bitcoin traded sideways. That lull could come back in the next three months as industry drivers wrestle with macro drivers. "It\'s clear that [the Fed] is not fully comfortable yet with the direction of headline inflation numbers," Christopher Ferraro, president and chief investment officer of Galaxy Digital, told CNBC. "So while they pause rate hikes, they\'re in no way yet committing to a permanent pause or even a rate decline."

Here\'s what to expect for exposed stocks Recession worries are likely to carry over into the second half of 2023 Wall Street analysts reveal their top ideas for the second half, including this red-hot solar name The AI-powered rally to start the year could broaden out in the third quarter A.I. enthusiasm drove up stocks this year. Here\'s how investors can catch the next opportunity The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged at the conclusion of its June meeting, but said two more could be coming later this year. Some on Wall Street are anticipating the Fed will move in July and September. Powell has said the FOMC hasn\'t decided if a new hike is likely to take place in July. "You see every day disparate and sometimes orthogonal data points coming out around is the economy growing? Is it shrinking? Are we headed for recession, are we not?" Ferraro added. "It\'s a very uncertain macro environment, which will make this not a one direction move for any asset class, let alone bitcoin." Cantor Fitzgerald\'s Elliot Han said while bitcoin has finally reclaimed the $30,000 level, it failed to maintain it for several weeks as the macro challenges are "currently dampening upside for crypto." Regulation and ETFs Beyond the macro backdrop, it\'s clear developments in U.S. regulation and ETF applications will continue to be the main themes in the third quarter. The rush of efforts to get approval for a spot bitcoin ETF came at the height of the Securities and Exchange Commissions\' hostility toward crypto and many hope institutions like BlackRock , Fidelity and Invesco – which filed for a bitcoin ETF with Galaxy in June – can force some change. It could take a while, however. "From a timing perspective, I think it\'s largely unknown" when a decision on an ETF could come, Ferraro said. "But … all these institutions have real concerted efforts and likely would not have put the effort in motion now if there wasn\'t a strong belief that the market and the regulators, in particular the SEC, were ready to allow regulated products." "Given all of the regulatory uncertainty and the court cases that are going on … it\'s actually an opportune time for the regulators to allow regulated products into the market and help clear out some of the concern or lack of clarity," he added. The rest of the world While that uncertainty continues in the U.S., other parts of the world are taking a friendlier stance toward the industry. U.K. regulators have developed a "Regulatory Sandbox" to allow crypto companies to test new innovations, continental Europe has an established exchange-traded products market for crypto, and Hong Kong has been clear and vocal about its desire to become a crypto hub for the world. "There\'s still a disparity in the treatment of crypto in the U.S. and the rest of the world," Han said. "The question is will the U.S. follow suit or continue with its litigious approach?" There\'s a growing number of U.S. companies that are no longer willing to wait for regulatory clarity as the price of bitcoin ticks higher, he added – and many are expecting a big price surge in the spring they won\'t want to miss. BTC.CM= YTD mountain Bitcoin is up more than 80% YTD "Some are looking to move their headquarters, or at the least establish large offices, in crypto friendly jurisdictions," Han added.

"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market has been experiencing a downward trend with sell signals from the MACD indicator, fluctuating open prices, decreasing total transactions, and inconsistent total value transferred. This indicates a bearish market sentiment in the short term.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights a positive sentiment in the market due to the growing acceptance and mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin. The potential approval of Bitcoin ETFs could lead to increased investment in the cryptocurrency market, potentially benefiting Ethereum (ETH) as well.

In reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a cautious and informed approach is necessary to balance the conflicting signals in the market. Prioritizing long-term strategies over short-term gains is crucial in navigating the volatile market conditions and maximizing profitability.

Considering the current market trend and the importance of risk management, I would take a conservative trading approach and hold my position in ETH for the long term. Therefore, my trading action would be 0.3, reflecting moderate confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.
ACTION:
0.3
DAILY RETURN:
-0.00048688338658886554
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that there is a bearish sentiment in the ETH market, with indicators pointing towards potential further price declines. The MACD signal on sell and the fluctuations in various on-chain metrics suggest a lack of strong positive momentum in the near future. 

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights a more positive sentiment in the overall cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin showing gains and the filing of spot Bitcoin ETF applications by major firms. However, the caution expressed by the SEC regarding these filings has introduced some uncertainty into the market.

In light of these reports, it is important to take a cautious and informed approach to trading ETH. While short-term gains may be possible, the overall market trend seems to favor a more conservative and long-term strategy. By balancing the bearish on-chain signals with the positive news sentiment, traders can make strategic decisions to manage risks effectively.

Therefore, I would recommend taking a conservative approach and focusing on long-term strategies rather than short-term gains. My trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.7, reflecting a moderate level of confidence in the bearish market trend and the importance of managing risk appropriately.
ACTION:
-0.7
DAILY RETURN:
-0.0008227546796469865
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the short-term trend for ETH is bearish, with a potential for further price declines. The MACD signal consistently indicates a sell trend, and the overall market sentiment seems to be negative. On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights a positive market trend for Bitcoin, driven by growing institutional interest and positive developments in the cryptocurrency market.

In reflecting on the reports, it is essential to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains in order to effectively manage risks and maximize profitability. While the short-term trend for ETH may be bearish, the positive market sentiment surrounding Bitcoin and institutional interest in cryptocurrencies suggest a more optimistic long-term outlook for the overall market.

Considering the cautious and informed approach recommended in the reflection analyst report, it is advisable to adopt a conservative trading strategy and focus on risk management. Therefore, my trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.5, reflecting a moderate level of confidence in the bearish short-term trend for ETH and the importance of managing risks effectively in the current market conditions.

The XRP token was the only one in the red, inching down 0.02% to US$0.4824.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization over the past 24 hours rose 1.18% to US$1.21 trillion and market volume increased 20.72% to US$31.55 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nBitcoin NFT sales fall, Ethereum NFT sales gain\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index fell 1.16% to 2,761.68 points in the 24 hours to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong and dropped 5.11% during the week.\n\nBitcoin’s 24-hour non-fungible token sales fell 15.56% to US$2.57 million, as sales for Uncategorized Ordinals fell 34.38% to US$1.25 million.\n\nEthereum’s 24-hour NFT sales rose 7.54% to US$24.96 million, as sales for the largest Ethereum-native NFT collection, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, rose 1.76% to US$5.35 million, while Mutant Ape Yacht Club sales inched up 1.69% to US$2.4 million.\n\nAzuki sales decreased 19.19% to US$1.89 million, after the new Azuki Elementals collection was criticized for being too similar to the original.\n\n“Brutal weekend for NFTs,” said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News. “It might be easy to point to Azuki’s Elementals mint as the catalyst still, but lowering average sales and floor prices in top collections prior to Elementals mint showed that we were on the cusp of another free fall.”\n\nThe Azuki Elementals collection began minting last Tuesday and sold out in 15 minutes, but left collectors disappointed as the latest collection looked almost the same as the original.\n\nAmong the Forkast Labs NFT indexes, the Forkast CAR NFT Composite was the only one in the green, inching up 0.84% to 967.02 points.\n\nAsian equities, U.S. stock futures rise on signs of easing U.S.-China tension\n\nImage: elements.envato\n\nMajor Asian equities strengthened as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong ahead of U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s trip to Beijing Wednesday to deepen communication between the two biggest global economies.\n\nJapan’s Nikkei 225 rose 1.7% and the Shenzhen Component Index inched up 0.59%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 2.06% and the Shanghai Composite strengthened 1.31%.\n\nInvestor sentiment was bolstered by comments from Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, who told CNN on Tuesday that U.S. inflation could fall to the Fed’s 2% target by 2025. But he also cautioned of a “higher probability of a mild recession.”\n\nMost U.S. stock futures strengthened during Monday afternoon trading in Hong Kong, after falling U.S. inflation bolstered hopes of a less hawkish stance from the Federal Reserve. The S&P 500 futures index inched up 0.061%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures strengthened 0.29% but the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 0.11%.\n\nInvestors now await the release of the ISM Manufacturing Purchasing Manager’s Index and S&P Global Manufacturing Purchasing Manager’s Index for June, scheduled for Monday.\n\nInvestors are expecting more interest rate hikes this year in the U.S. following reiterated warnings from Fed Chair Jerome Powell in speeches last week in Europe ...'}, {'id': 14, 'time': 'Mon, 03 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Bitcoin breaches US$31,000 on BlackRock's updated ETF; Ether gains, Polygon leads winners - Yahoo Finance", 'content': 'Bitcoin climbed above US$31,000 in Tuesday morning trading in Asia after Blackrock refiled a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) application in the U.S. after the regulator criticised an earlier filing, suggesting the world’s biggest money manager is determined to take a lead in cryptocurrency markets.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency reached a high of US$31,371 early Tuesday morning, the highest since June 2022.\n\nBlackRock submitted an amended application for a spot Bitcoin ETF on Monday, after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said BlackRock’s original filing was inadequate. BlackRock indicated in the new filing that Coinbase, the custodian of the proposed ETF’s Bitcoin holdings, will provide market surveillance to support the ETF, according to a Bloomberg report on Tuesday.\n\nSeveral other financial institutions have filed Bitcoin ETF applications despite a crackdown last month by the SEC, which filed lawsuits against Binance.US and Coinbase last month for allegedly violating securities laws in trading cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn emailed comments, Jeff Mei, chief operating officer of digital asset exchange BTSE, said the SEC criticism of the application caused some selling last week, but “investors remain quietly optimistic about future approvals.”\n\nEther gained 1.18% to US$1,954.24, and added 5.23% for the week.\n\nBitcoin and Ether have both seen increased interest from financial institutions in the past week, according to a Monday report from European cryptocurrency investment firm CoinShares.\n\nBitcoin-linked digital asset investment products saw net inflows of around US$123 million in the week ending June 30, while Ethereum-linked products had net inflows of around US$2.7 million.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that there is a bearish sentiment in the ETH market, with indicators pointing towards potential further price declines. The MACD signal on sell and the fluctuations in various on-chain metrics suggest a lack of strong positive momentum in the near future. 

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights a more positive sentiment in the overall cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin showing gains and the filing of spot Bitcoin ETF applications by major firms. However, the caution expressed by the SEC regarding these filings has introduced some uncertainty into the market.

In light of these reports, it is important to take a cautious and informed approach to trading ETH. While short-term gains may be possible, the overall market trend seems to favor a more conservative and long-term strategy. By balancing the bearish on-chain signals with the positive news sentiment, traders can make strategic decisions to manage risks effectively.

Therefore, I would recommend taking a conservative approach and focusing on long-term strategies rather than short-term gains. My trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.7, reflecting a moderate level of confidence in the bearish market trend and the importance of managing risk appropriately.
ACTION:

DAILY RETURN:
-0.0008227546796469865
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the short-term trend for ETH is bearish, with a potential for further price declines. The MACD signal consistently indicates a sell trend, and the overall market sentiment seems to be negative. On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights a positive market trend for Bitcoin, driven by growing institutional interest and positive developments in the cryptocurrency market.

In reflecting on the reports, it is essential to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains in order to effectively manage risks and maximize profitability. While the short-term trend for ETH may be bearish, the positive market sentiment surrounding Bitcoin and institutional interest in cryptocurrencies suggest a more optimistic long-term outlook for the overall market.

Considering the cautious and informed approach recommended in the reflection analyst report, it is advisable to adopt a conservative trading strategy and focus on risk management. Therefore, my trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.5, reflecting a moderate level of confidence in the bearish short-term trend for ETH and the importance of managing risks effectively in the current market conditions.
ACTION:
-0.5
DAILY RETURN:
-0.00023992995977806242
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the market trend for ETH is bearish, with the MACD signal consistently showing a sell trend. The fluctuating network activity and bearish sentiment suggest potential further price declines in the near future. 

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights regulatory challenges and macroeconomic uncertainties in the crypto market, with cautious optimism for Ether and potential upside if regulatory clarity is achieved. 

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a cautious and informed approach is necessary to navigate the volatile market conditions. Prioritizing long-term strategies over short-term gains is crucial for managing risks and maximizing profitability.

Considering the synthesized reports, the clear market trend for ETH appears to be bearish in the short term, with potential upside in the long term if regulatory clarity is achieved. Therefore, a conservative trading approach focused on risk management is warranted.

Given the bearish sentiment in the short term and positive long-term outlook, I would take a conservative trading action with a confidence level of 0.3, indicating a cautious approach to managing risk and capitalizing on future opportunities in the cryptocurrency market.

This significant recovery in Bitcoin's price has also spurred buying activity in various altcoins, causing them to rise substantially from their annual lows. After reaching above the $31,000 mark on June 23, Bitcoin consolidated at $30,000 throughout the past week. It currently remains near the strong resistance level of $31,000, with neither bulls or bears taking control in the larger time frame.To gain momentum, buyers must restore the rate to the $31,200 zone, potentially leading to a breakout above the $31,458 resistance level. This indicates that the bulls are not rushing to secure profits, as they expect further upward movement. Bulls have shown increased interest in Bitcoin recently, driven by the positive investor sentiment, which has been fueled by notable financial institutions such as BlockRock Invesco , and WisdomTree filing for Bitcoin ETFs However, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said these filings were inadequate last Friday, citing a lack of clarity and the need for additional information before reconsidering approval. Despite this news, BTC has maintained a positive stance well above the $30,000 level. BTC's support level currently stands at $29,500. This week will feature significant economic events in the US, including the release of the FOMC minutes for June on Wednesday, the job openings report on Thursday, and new employment numbers on Friday, which may introduce some market volatility.Meanwhile, Ethereum is trading in close proximity to the $2,000 level. Its price has gained momentum above $1,920, with immediate resistance found near $1,960 and then $2,000. Failing to surpass these resistance levels could initiate a downward correction. The current support level for Ethereum rests at $1,930.In an exciting turn of events, on Thursday the Financial Services and Markets Act, 2023 — a reform bill in the United Kingdom — received Royal Assent from King Charles, officially transforming it into a law. With the implementation of this legislation, crypto trading is now acknowledged as a regulated financial activity, signifying a momentous achievement in the regulatory realm of the crypto industry. After the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA), this progressive law in the UK aims to establish a robust regulatory framework that bolsters investor confidence and encourages innovation within the crypto sector. By introducing clear rules and guidelines, it fosters a secure and transparent environment for crypto-related activities, thereby attracting increased participation from investors and businesses alike.Coming to the price action, among the top 100 cryptos by market cap, here are the best and worst-performing ones over the past week:As per prices on Monday.1.

On Tuesday, the price of the world’s largest cryptocurrency reached US$31,371, its highest since June 2022, on the back of optimism about spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund applications by a raft of Wall Street heavyweights, including Blackrock.\n\nThe level of Bitcoin dominance sits near 50%, which is the highest since April 2021. Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro, says this price uptrend in Bitcoin is a typical market recovery pattern in which the most significant asset in the sector attracts buyers first.\n\n“It will probably take about a year of Bitcoin price recovery before crypto enthusiasts start looking for one with higher risk, pushing altcoins higher and leading to a new wave of capitalisation swell,” said Kuptsikevich, in an email statement. He said he doesn’t see altcoins rallying before November.\n\nBitcoin’s recent price recovery was sparked by Blackrock, the world’s biggest asset manager, filing an application last month to launch a Bitcoin ETF and refiling it again after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) indicated it lacked details.\n\nSeveral other U.S.-based asset managers, such as Fidelity Investments and WisdomTree, have filed their own Bitcoin ETFs, suggesting mainstream finance recognizes the Bitcoin opportunity and wants to offer clients the access to its price movements without actually owning the token.\n\nStory continues\n\nEther, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, looked to be on a run to break US$2,000 this week, but fell back 0.81% to US$1,941 today after a gain of 2.64% for the past seven days.\n\nThe other top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization traded mixed to flat, with Solana leading gainers with a 2.0% rise to US$19.45. The token has surged 15.35% in the past week.\n\nPolygon’s Matic and Binance’s BNB token were amongst the losers — Matic lost 1.99% to US$0.6981, though it’s still up 4.29% for the week. BNB lost 1.68% to US$242.83, cutting its weekly gain to 1.81%.\n\nAltcoins have suffered from the SEC’s crackdown on tokens that they deem financial securities. Solana, Cardano, Polygon and BNB were among those that the regulator named as unregistered securities in its lawsuits filed against the Coinbase and Binance.US exchanges in early June.\n\nWhile these altcoins have partially recovered after an initial plunge following the SEC suits, several trading platforms including California-based Robinhood Markets Inc., Israel-based eToro and UK’s Revolut ceased support or limited access to some of these tokens for their U.S.-based customers.\n\nBitcoin Cash climbed to become the twelfth largest non-stablecoin cryptocurrency by market capitalization on CoinMarketCap at US$53.8 billion. The Bitcoin spin-off is one of the four cryptocurrencies listed on EDX Markets, the Wall Street-backed, compliance-focused crypto exchange that launched on June 20 in the U.S.\n\nBitcoin Cash had a market capitalization of US$20.6 billion and was valued at US$106.34 on June 19. It has since surged 160% to US$276.87. It dipped 1.70% in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap fell 0.80% to US$1.21 trillion in the last 24 hours, while crypto trading volume fell 22.22% to US$31.14 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nAzuki dents NFT sentiment\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index rose 1.28% in the 24 hours to 07:45 a.m. in Hong Kong to 2,783.58, but logged a loss of 3.17% for the week. The two Forkast indexes measuring the performance of Ethereum and Polygon NFT markets rose.\n\nHowever, despite moderate gains in the indexes on Wednesday morning, the NFT market overall remains in a downtrend, said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\n“The Forkast 500 NFT Index reflects declining sales prices across collections on all chains, but it’s Ethereum that’s really dragging the market down with it,” said Petscher, pointing to the recent problems with the Azuki NFT collection.\n\n“Azuki’s struggles exasperated the already struggling market … Azuki’s new Elementals mint was supposed to be a boom for NFTs and instead was a bust, becoming a catalyst that drove NFT collections down to all-ti...'}]

The ETH cryptocurrency has been experiencing a downward trend recently, as indicated by the sell signals from the MACD indicator in the past few days. The open prices have been fluctuating around the $30,000 mark, with a slight decrease in total transactions and unique addresses. The average fees have also been relatively stable, while the total value transferred has shown some variability. Overall, the market sentiment appears bearish, with potential for further price declines in the near future. Investors should exercise caution and closely monitor the market for any potential changes in trend.
"""

NEWS ANALYST REPORT:
"""
The news articles suggest a growing interest from major financial institutions like BlackRock in democratizing and embracing cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, through the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink's positive comments on Bitcoin as an international asset and digitalized gold, along with the company's application for a spot Bitcoin ETF, have sparked institutional adoption and contributed to Bitcoin's price surge. The potential approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by US regulators could lead to increased participation from retail and institutional investors, potentially driving further market growth and expanding the cryptocurrency industry. Overall, the market trend appears to be bullish as more traditional financial players show interest and confidence in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT:
"""
In reflecting on recent trading performance, it is evident that a cautious and informed approach to trading has been more successful in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. Prioritizing long-term strategies over short-term gains, considering on-chain data, news sentiment, and market reflections, has led to more profitable outcomes. The conflicting signals in the market highlight the importance of balancing risk and reward, with a focus on managing risks effectively. Moving forward, it is crucial to closely monitor regulatory developments, institutional interest, and network activity as key indicators that are likely to influence future trades. A conservative trading approach may be warranted given the current market uncertainty, with a focus on capital preservation and strategic decision-making to capitalize on long-term growth potential.

*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the ETH market is currently experiencing a downward trend with bearish sentiment. The sell signals from the MACD indicator, fluctuating open prices around $30,000, and decrease in total transactions and unique addresses all point towards a potential further decline in price.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights a bullish trend in the overall cryptocurrency market, particularly driven by growing interest from major financial institutions like BlackRock in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The potential approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs could lead to increased market participation and growth.

In reflecting on the reports, it is clear that a cautious and informed approach to trading is necessary in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. Balancing the bearish signals from the on-chain analysis with the bullish sentiment from the news report, it is crucial to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains.

Therefore, considering the conflicting signals and the importance of managing risks effectively, I would take a conservative approach and hold my position in ETH for the long term. My trading action would be 0.3, reflecting a moderate confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.

It gave back those gains, however, after better-than-expected U.S. jobs data increased investor worries about path of interest rates. The earlier move was in contrast to both weaker stock prices and rising yields — the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note later climbed above 4% to a 16-year high.

That will eventually be broken, but meanwhile traditional markets seem to be entering a more risk-off mood – we can\'t yet assume that bitcoin will just shrug that off." Sentiment among traders was high though, after BlackRock CEO Larry Fink gave bitcoin perhaps its biggest ever endorsement from a major institutional player. Speaking on Fox Business News on Wednesday, Fink called bitcoin "an international asset" and said it\'s "not based on any one currency so it can represent an asset that people can play as an alternative." Bitcoin has steadily climbed since June 15, when BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, first filed to launch a spot bitcoin ETF.

REASONING:
After reviewing the three analyst reports, it is clear that there are conflicting perspectives on the current market trend for ETH. The on-chain analyst report suggests a bearish outlook with potential downside movement in the near term, while the news analyst report highlights the positive sentiment in the market, fueled by institutional interest and ongoing developments in the cryptocurrency space. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a cautious and informed approach to trading, focusing on long-term strategies and risk management.

Considering the information provided, it is important to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains in the current market environment. While short-term fluctuations may occur, the overall positive sentiment and growth potential in the cryptocurrency market, as indicated by the news analyst report, suggest that a long-term perspective is key to maximizing profit and managing risks effectively.

After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the ETH market is currently experiencing a downward trend with bearish sentiment. The sell signals from the MACD indicator, fluctuating open prices around $30,000, and decrease in total transactions and unique addresses all point towards a potential further decline in price.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights a bullish trend in the overall cryptocurrency market, particularly driven by growing interest from major financial institutions like BlackRock in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The potential approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs could lead to increased market participation and growth.

However, Bitcoin fell below $30,000 due to profit-taking and concerns about interest rate hikes, leading to a risk-off sentiment in the market. Ethereum also experienced a decline. Despite this, Solana saw a significant increase. Overall, the market trend appears to be mixed, with potential volatility as investors react to economic data, interest rate expectations, and institutional interest in cryptocurrencies.

*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market has been on a downward trend, but there is a potential buy signal in the MACD indicator that may indicate a reversal. The news analyst report highlights mixed market trends with potential volatility due to various factors such as profit-taking, interest rate concerns, and institutional interest. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a cautious and informed approach to trading, prioritizing long-term strategies over short-term gains.

Considering all the reports, it is evident that the market is currently uncertain and volatile. While there may be potential for a bullish reversal in the ETH market, the overall mixed trends and potential volatility suggest a conservative trading approach is warranted. Long-term strategies that focus on managing risks effectively and maximizing profits over time seem to be the most appropriate in the current market conditions.

Therefore, I would take a cautious approach and assign a trading action of 0.3, reflecting moderate confidence in the potential bullish reversal but also acknowledging the overall uncertainty and volatility in the market. This decision aligns with the recommendation to prioritize long-term strategies and manage risks effectively in navigating the cryptocurrency market.

The token briefly touched $31,504 on Thursday, the highest level since June 2022.'}, {'id': 2, 'time': 'Fri, 07 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'JPMorgan Doubts That the Approval of a US Bitcoin ETF Would Be a Game-Changer - Bloomberg', 'content': 'Should an exchange-traded fund that invests directly in Bitcoin receive approval in the US, it won’t be the game-changer for crypto markets that many digital-asset advocates have long predicted.\n\nThat’s according to JPMorgan strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou , who argues that even though there’s broader optimism a physically backed fund could get regulatory blessing, any approval won’t be transformational for the sector since such products have existed in Canada and Europe for years without having seen tremendous inflows. Bitcoin funds overall have “attracted little investor interest” over the past two years, “failing to benefit from investor outflows from gold ETFs,” he said in a note.'}, {'id': 20, 'time': 'Fri, 07 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Blackrock's Bitcoin ETF Filing Ignites Price Rally, Hope for Approval - Nasdaq", 'content': 'By Landon Manning\n\nAfter contentious rumors and a re-filing with the U.S. Securities And Exchange Commission (SEC), major investment management firm BlackRock’s proposal to launch a long-awaited Bitcoin ETF may soon meet regulatory approval.\n\nOne of the most anticipated developments in the world of Bitcoin financialization is the concept of the Bitcoin ETF, which has yet to be approved for the U.S. financial ecosystem. Essentially, an ETF (exchange-traded fund) is a pooled investment security, a financial instrument that ties its value to that of some external source like a collection of commodities, stock indices or other types of asset. In other words, a Bitcoin ETF would be a security that corporate and individual investors could purchase to speculate on Bitcoin’s success without actually owning the crypto asset directly.\n\nAlthough the number of people getting into Bitcoin and cryptocurrency has gone up over the years, a Bitcoin ETF would make the leading cryptocurrency vastly more accessible and potentially give millions of new investors skin in the game. Understandably then, the possibility of such a product becoming a reality has been making headlines for years, and while many have filed for regulatory approval of Bitcoin-focused ETFs, none have been approved by regulators in the U.S.\n\nBut the entrance of BlackRock as the latest financial firm to submit a Bitcoin-focused ETF proposal to the SEC, is particularly notable. This leading legacy firm has a near-perfect track record in obtaining ETF approvals. Following initial document filing for a spot Bitcoin ETF last month, the cryptocurrency market seemed to take heart, with bitcoin reaching one-year highs shortly after the application.\n\nAlthough the SEC has long signaled concern over the volatility of crypto assets, momentum now seems to favor bitcoin, with BlackRock potentially offering a product never seen before in the space. Although many comparisons can be made between this and previous existing products, an approval here could mark a new era for mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin.\n\nAs the bitcoin price appears to be rallying merely from the rumor of such a product, it seems likely that an actual approval would bring even more price momentum.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.'}, {'id': 44, 'time': 'Fri, 07 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Refile and wait? Pulse check on the quest for a spot bitcoin ETF - CNBC', 'content': 'Bitcoin\'s bounce back this summer has largely been fueled by renewed hopes of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund launch this year, but recent attempts from major firms like Fidelity and BlackRock continue to be deemed insufficient for approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n"Everybody refiled, depending on how you read the paperwork," Dave Nadig, financial futurist at VettaFi, told Bob Pisani on CNBC\'s "ETF Edge" on Wednesday. "All of them are now talking about having a surveillance-sharing agreement with Coinbase ."\n\nSurveillance-sharing agreements between exchanges and crypto custodians like Coinbase were put into place by asset managers in an attempt to appease the SEC\'s concerns about possible fraud and market manipulation. But the regulator still found the filings to lack clarity and comprehension, prompting BlackRock to refile last week.\n\n"And I think there\'s this idea that somehow BlackRock knew something," Nadig said. "And that the SEC is on the verge of approving this, once these surveillance-sharing agreements are in place."\n\nBlackRock first filed its application to launch the iShares Bitcoin Trust last month, with Fidelity following suit two weeks later. WisdomTree, VanEck and Invesco have also taken the steps toward their own funds.\n\nNadig explained that he still remains fairly negative on the SEC\'s imminent approval, the most realistic scenario being an SEC response indicating a new standard for filings and surveillance-sharing agreements across the board.\n\n"There\'s a level of scrutiny involved that I will be surprised if Coinbase can meet the mark on," Nadig said. "However, if [the SEC] is trying to manufacture a way to approve a bitcoin ETF, this would be the way to do it. It would still be a big shift from what they\'ve said in the past."\n\nThe filings come amid an ongoing legal battle between Grayscale and the SEC about converting its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF. A decision in the case is expected later this year.\n\n"I think it\'s quite reasonable to say that the SEC has been arbitrary and capricious on how they\'ve applied certain rules," Nadig said, adding that the SEC historically has viewed corresponding commodity spot and futures products as a positive indicator for approval.\n\n"That doesn\'t mean that they necessarily approve the conversion of GBTC into an ETF," he added. "But I think they can still lose that lawsuit that says [the SEC] treated somebody unfairly under the Administrative Procedures Act."\n\nBut Nadig explained that a potential loss by the SEC in the Grayscale lawsuit will not necessarily translate to a green light for asset management firms seeking spot funds.\n\n"I think the odds are still negative for this year," Nadig said. "But certainly, things look more positive than they did maybe three weeks ago, six weeks ago."\n\nDisclaimer'}, {'id': 11, 'time': 'Fri, 07 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "RFK Jr. touted bitcoin but said he wasn't an investor. Financial records show otherwise - CNBC", 'content': 'Robert F. Kennedy Jr., son of former U.S. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, speaks during the Bitcoin 2023 conference in Miami Beach, Florida, May 19, 2023.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., a Democratic candidate for president, stood at the world\'s biggest bitcoin conference in Miami in May and told the crowd, "I am not an investor and I am not here to give investment advice." Then he announced he would be accepting campaign donations in bitcoin.\n\nWhat Kennedy didn\'t tell the crowd was that his family had invested in bitcoin recently, according to a financial disclosure form he filed June 30. On the twelfth page of the report, Kennedy lists a brokerage account that held between $100,001 and $250,000 worth of bitcoin. Hours after publication of this story, Kennedy\'s campaign manager, former Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich, told CNBC that the bitcoin purchase was made after the speech in Miami and before the June 30 filing deadline.\n\nThe situation could represent a conflict of interest if Kennedy were touting bitcoin on the campaign trail while his immediate family held the cryptocurrency, according to Virginia Canter, the chief ethics counsel for watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.\n\n"There is no conflict here," Kucinich told CNBC in a follow-up interview.\n\nSince the conference, Kennedy has continued to tout bitcoin.\n\nIn late June, he tweeted: "Bitcoin is not only a bulwark against totalitarianism and the manipulation of our money supply, it points the way toward a future in which government institutions are more transparent and more democratic." The tweet includes a video of part of his Miami speech where he describes how he would be pro-bitcoin as president.\n\nThe filing says the bitcoin holding made less than $201 in income but doesn\'t say when it was purchased. Nor does the filing say who purchased it or how much the family may have spent on their original investment. It also doesn\'t say whether they sold their bitcoin holding.\n\nThe bitcoin holding is listed under a section on the form that includes assets that can also belong to spouses and dependent children. It is intended to reflect holdings from the "preceding calendar year and current year to filing date," according to the Office of Government Ethics. Kennedy is married to "Curb Your Enthusiasm" star Cheryl Hines and has six children. Kennedy signed and filed the disclosure form to the Office of Government Ethics at the end of last month, according to the document.\n\nAfter CNBC made multiple attempts to get a comment, the Kennedy campaign said hours after the publication of this story that "the investments were not his, but his wife\'s. He is not involved in her investment decisions." The campaign did not say for how long Hines held the bitcoin investment or when she purchased the asset.\n\nLater Friday, however, a campaign representative sent a new statement, saying the bitcoin investment is indeed Kennedy\'s. "I was mistaken in my last communication. Mr. Kennedy does hold a bitcoin investment, but it came later. At the time of the bitcoin speech he had no cryptocurrency holdings," the representative said.\n\nBefore the Kennedy campaign commented, CREW\'s Canter said the ownership is certainly current as of June 30, when he filed his disclosure. "Under a traditional conflict of interest analysis, Hines\' financial interests are imputed to him," Canter said.\n\n"I\'m really concerned that he\'s speaking at this conference, touting this investment to potential voters while the family has a history of owning bitcoin. It\'s like he could do the same thing for Procter and Gamble," she added. "There\'s no difference in my mind from a conflicts perspective."\n\nAfter Kennedy\'s appearance in May at the Miami conference, CNBC inquired whether Kennedy had any crypto holdings. "Mr. Kennedy has no crypto holdings," a spokeswoman for the campaign said at the time.\n\nKennedy said at the conference that if he were to become president he would "make sure that your right to hold and use bitcoin is inviolable."\n\nPresident Joe Biden\'s administration has waged an aggressive fight in regard to cryptocurrencies. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler told CNBC in June "we don\'t need more digital currency" after the SEC sued crypto exchange Coinbase for allegedly acting as an unregistered broker and exchange.\n\nBitcoin\'s price has seen an upswing recently, hitting a 13-month high Thursday, despite parts of the crypto industry seeing headwinds.\n\nKennedy\'s campaign has seized attention from several wealthy supporters, even as he remains far behind Biden in Democratic primary polls. A Quinnipiac survey from June shows Biden with 70% support among Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters, while Kennedy has 17%. Kennedy, 69, is the son of former Attorney General and U.S. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and the nephew of former President John F. Kennedy, both of whom were assassinated in the 1960s.\n\nKennedy\'s pro-bitcoin stance has aligned him with several top tech investors...'}]

DAILY RETURN:

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the ETH market is currently experiencing a downward trend with bearish sentiment. The sell signals from the MACD indicator, fluctuating open prices around $30,000, and decrease in total transactions and unique addresses all point towards a potential further decline in price.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights a bullish trend in the overall cryptocurrency market, particularly driven by growing interest from major financial institutions like BlackRock in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The potential approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs could lead to increased market participation and growth.

In reflecting on the reports, it is clear that a cautious and informed approach to trading is necessary in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. Balancing the bearish signals from the on-chain analysis with the bullish sentiment from the news report, it is crucial to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains.

Therefore, considering the conflicting signals and the importance of managing risks effectively, I would take a conservative approach and hold my position in ETH for the long term. My trading action would be 0.3, reflecting a moderate confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.

[{'id': 11, 'time': 'Sat, 08 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'How Bitcoin’s Next Halving Will Affect Struggling Crypto Miners (BTC) - Bloomberg', 'content': 'Sign up for our new Crypto newsletter and follow @crypto Twitter for the latest news.\n\nCrypto enthusiasts are hopeful that a once-in-four-years event which rewrites the underlying code of the world’s biggest cryptocurrency will extend the current market rally. But the milestone also risks sounding the death knell for certain Bitcoin miners.'}, {'id': 23, 'time': 'Sat, 08 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'This Week in Coins: Solana Surges as Bitcoin and Ethereum Rally Rebound - Yahoo Finance', 'content': 'Illustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nEchoing last week, the values of market leaders Bitcoin and Ethereum remained pretty inert over the past seven days.\n\nNonetheless, market leader Bitcoin (BTC) hit a one-year high after crossing the $31,000 threshold on Monday on news that the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, was refiling its application to the SEC for a Bitcoin spot ETF—a regulated investment vehicle that, if approved, would provide investors with exposure to Bitcoin without the dangers of buying it directly.\n\nThe SEC expressed misgivings about BlackRock’s first filing last month, stating broadly that none of the many applicants for a Bitcoin spot ETF have been specific enough about how they\'ll integrate a "surveillance-sharing agreement" to deter fraud and manipulation. Such an agreement would allow applicants to monitor market trading activity and clearing activity and verify customer identity.\n\nBlackRock named Coinbase as its market surveillance partner in its refiling. Two days later, the crypto-focused asset manager Valkyrie also refiled its ETF application and, echoing BlackRock, it named Coinbase as its market surveillance partner.\n\nIn another bullish sign for Bitcoin fans, the crypto ATM operator Bitcoin Depot became the first company of its kind to be publicly listed on the NASDAQ on Monday.\n\nHowever, the headlines weren’t enough to turn Bitcoin’s upward price movement into a sustained rally. The biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization dropped back under $31,000 on Tuesday, then briefly recrossed the threshold early on Thursday before bottoming out at $30,153.\n\nBitcoin’s volatility settled down by the weekend. It currently changes hands at $30,252—about one percent lower than it was this time last week.\n\nEthereum (ETH) holders suffered marginally greater losses. The second biggest cryptocurrency in the world dropped in value 2.8% to enter the weekend at $1,861. It moved in step with Bitcoin, posting intraweek highs of close to $2,000 on Monday and Thursday.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe prices of most of the top thirty cryptocurrencies remained flat over the last seven days. The biggest growth was observed in Solana (SOL), which exploded 20% to hit $22.85 by Saturday, up nearly 20% for the week.\n\nRemarkably, Solana thrived in spite of news that popular trading app Revolut is delisting it—along with Polygon (MATIC) and Cardano (ADA)—after they were named as securities by the SEC in its ongoing lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase.\n\nBig losses were felt by holders of Litecoin (LTC) and Ethereum Classic (ETC). The former dropped 11% to $98, while the latter dropped 12.5% to $19.06.\n\nEthereum forked from Ethereum Classic in 2016 after an infamous DAO smart contract hack enabled thieves to abscond with $55 million in ETH. The Ethereum community voted to have the illicit transactions wiped from the blockchain and continued under the name Ethereum. The original ledger recording these transactions continued as Ethereum Classic.\n\nRegulation in Asia and the UK\n\nOn Monday, Singapore announced two new consumer protection measures as the island nation’s regulators continued to build a regulatory framework for its burgeoning crypto industry.\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)—the country’s chief financial regulator—will enforce a ban on lending and staking for retail customers (individual traders, as opposed to institutional clients).\n\nThe MAS now also requires that exchanges move customers’ digital assets into a trust before the end of the year to prevent an FTX-style scenario where their funds are commingled or traded.\n\nCoincidentally, Thailand’s Securities and Exchange Commission also announced a ban on “depository services that offer returns to depositors and lenders,” thus outright banning exchanges from offering both lending and staking services.\n\nOn the other side of the globe on Tuesday, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) for the United Kingdom announced that companies promoting cryptocurrencies to UK customers must get ready to comply with the regulator’s financial promotion regime before October 8, 2023.\n\nThe rules govern all communications that can be regarded as “financial promotion,” including websites, social media posts, mobile apps, and online advertising. Crypto companies will need to register with the FCA to get authorization and, if approved, they’ll also need to pay a fee.'}, {'id': 5, 'time': 'Sat, 08 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Coinbase Is The Real Winner in the Bitcoin ETF Race - The Motley Fool', 'content': 'In the last month, a wave of major financial institutions have applied to offer spot Bitcoin (BTC -0.18%) exchange-traded funds (ETF) in a bid to bridge Wall Street with the original cryptocurrency. BlackRock (BLK -0.43%) made headlines on June 15 as the first firm to submit an application, followed by Fidelity, Ark Invest, Invesco, WisdomTree, and VanEck, all vying for a piece of the Bitcoin ETF market.\n\nWhile the potential benefits for Bitcoin itself seem obvious, there is another player that stands to gain significantly from this race: Coinbase Global (COIN -1.72%).\n\nThe current situation\n\nAfter receiving the applications, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) wasted no time in reviewing them and promptly sent them back for revisions, deeming them "inadequate." The main issue it identified was a lack of clarity on how the firms would minimize fraud and market manipulation, a key concern for the agency.\n\nIn response to the SEC\'s feedback, each of the six firms expeditiously refiled their applications and tapped Coinbase as the partner for a shared surveillance agreement. By adding measures to monitor potential market manipulation, Coinbase will play a crucial role in enhancing market integrity and providing the necessary oversight asked for by the government.\n\nTaking on a bigger role\n\nCoinbase\'s integral role in these applications is a testament to its position as a leader in the cryptocurrency industry. But the true opportunity for Coinbase lies not only in its surveillance capabilities but also in the additional services it will provide to the proposed fund issuers.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Coinbase is expected to perform various functions for these firms, including custodial services and acting as a trading platform to buy and sell Bitcoin.\n\nIn fact, both Ark Invest and BlackRock have tapped Coinbase for their custodial services. BlackRock explicitly states in its SEC filing that it will use Coinbase Prime, a product tailored for institutional investors, as the platform for its Bitcoin transactions.\n\nA lucrative opportunity\n\nTransaction fees and custodial services have historically contributed around 10% of Coinbase\'s quarterly revenue, but now that the platform might serve as a custodian and a brokerage with some of the biggest names on Wall Street, introduction of the Bitcoin ETFs could significantly bolster profits.\n\nTo understand the full scope of how much capital could be involved, we can take a look at the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC 3.00%), a popular product that provides investors with exposure to Bitcoin but one plagued with limitations such as inaccurate price tracking, a shortcoming that a spot ETF can remedy.\n\nAs of today, Grayscale holds more than 625,000 Bitcoins to back its Bitcoin Trust, totaling more than $19 billion. Assuming Coinbase hasn\'t changed its pricing structure since 2021 and still charges a 0.1% fee on custodial accounts, if it were to hold close to the same number of Bitcoins as the Grayscale Trust, the potential revenue from fees could amount to approximately $190 million based on recent Bitcoin prices. With net revenue from the first quarter of 2023 totaling $736 million, a boost in custodial fees of this size could increase Coinbase\'s bottom line by roughly 25%.\n\nAdding to the profitability of custodial services, Coinbase is in line to also benefit from transaction fees. A unique feature of the new spot ETF applications is that the firms will be able to buy and sell Bitcoin on a daily basis, a feature not currently present with the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. (This explains why it goes through bouts of trading at premiums or discounts relative to Bitcoin\'s actual price.)\n\nWith this added functionality, firms like BlackRock will be conducting a multitude of large transactions on a near-daily basis to help the ETF track Bitcoin\'s price more accurately, potentially adding a significant boost to Coinbase\'s revenue.\n\nSome necessary context\n\nDespite Coinbase\'s ongoing lawsuit involving the SEC, the momentum and common theme among all the ETF applications should be viewed as a vote of confidence from some of Wall Street\'s biggest players looking to do business with the company regardless of the SEC suit.\n\nAlthough no ETF has been approved yet, the SEC\'s blessing looks more likely by the day. Even better, Coinbase shares still remain down more than 75% from their all-time high.\n\nFor investors seeking exposure to the crypto industry\'s continued growth and a potential SEC approval of the United States\' first spot Bitcoin ETF, Coinbase could be a compelling long-term opportunity at current prices.'}]

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the ETH market is currently experiencing a downward trend with bearish sentiment. The sell signals from the MACD indicator, fluctuating open prices around $30,000, and decrease in total transactions and unique addresses all point towards a potential further decline in price.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights a bullish trend in the overall cryptocurrency market, particularly driven by growing interest from major financial institutions like BlackRock in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The potential approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs could lead to increased market participation and growth.

In reflecting on the reports, it is clear that a cautious and informed approach to trading is necessary in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. Balancing the bearish signals from the on-chain analysis with the bullish sentiment from the news report, it is crucial to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains.

Therefore, considering the conflicting signals and the importance of managing risks effectively, I would take a conservative approach and hold my position in ETH for the long term. My trading action would be 0.3, reflecting a moderate confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market has been on a downward trend, but there is a potential buy signal in the MACD indicator that may indicate a reversal.

The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a cautious and informed approach to trading, prioritizing long-term strategies over short-term gains.

Considering all the reports, it is evident that the market is currently uncertain and volatile. While there may be potential for a bullish reversal in the ETH market, the overall mixed trends and potential volatility suggest a conservative trading approach is warranted. Long-term strategies that focus on managing risks effectively and maximizing profits over time seem to be the most appropriate in the current market conditions.

Therefore, I would take a cautious approach and assign a trading action of 0.3, reflecting moderate confidence in the potential bullish reversal but also acknowledging the overall uncertainty and volatility in the market. This decision aligns with the recommendation to prioritize long-term strategies and manage risks effectively in navigating the cryptocurrency market.

Ether edged lower along with most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies, as anticipation of further interest rate hikes in the U.S. reduces appetite for risk across markets. Meanwhile, a JPMorgan report claims that the recent flurry of Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications in the U.S. may not be the game changer that some expect. This is reducing some of the optimism surrounding ongoing Bitcoin ETF applications by major Wall Street names, including BlackRock.\n\nCryptos fall as ETF hype cools\n\nBitcoin dropped 0.32% over the last 24 hours to US$30,157 at 07:40 a.m. in Hong Kong to post a weekly loss of 1.33%, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world’s leading cryptocurrency traded in the lower US$30,000 range over the weekend.\n\nEther edged 0.09% lower to US$1,862 and lost 3.71% for the week.\n\nMost other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies also logged losses in the past 24 hours. The exception was Polygon’s Matic token, which gained 1.15% to US$0.6876. It added 1.07% over the past seven days.\n\nWhile multiple Bitcoin ETF applications in the past month have stirred optimism in the crypto market, their approval may not prove as transformational as some Bitcoin advocates expect, claimed a JP Morgan report on Friday. Similar products have existed in Canada and Europe but received limited inflows, the report suggests.\n\nDespite this element of doubt creeping in, Bitcoin whales remain bullish on the token. Blockchain data tracker Santiment noted in a tweet on Sunday that addresses holding 10 to 10,000 Bitcoin had added a further 71,000 Bitcoin totalling approximately US$2.15 billion since July 17.\n\n🦈🐳 #Bitcoin\'s sharks and whales aren\'t showing any signs of slowing down, even with prices beginning to get "boring" in this $30k to $31k range.

The move is likely to take effect from July 11.\n\nFounded in 2018 and headquartered in Singapore, BingX said it provides services in over 100 countries and regions, with over 5 million users, according to the press release.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap was unchanged in the past 24 hours at US$1.18 trillion, while crypto trading volume dipped 0.22% to US$19.74 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nDead cat bounce for NFT collections\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market.

Forkast’s Ethereum, Polygon and Cardano NFT market indices also logged drops, while Solana’s index inched higher.\n\n“Over the past few days the NFT market buyers and farmers have found some value in NFT collections that had hit all-time low floor prices,” said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\nThe world’s leading NFT marketplace Blur launched its version 2 trading platform last Thursday. This introduced a new “trait bidding” feature that allows traders to bid on specific NFT traits rather than collections and receive Blur reward points.\n\n“Blur’s new trait offers are possibly taking pressure off of floor NFT farming,” said Petscher. This could potentially lead to more price stability for Ethereum NFT projects, he added.\n\nThe floor prices of major Ethereum-based NFT collections Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), Azuki and HV-MTL have all logged two-digit gains in the past seven days. However, all three are still down at least 25% for the month, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\n“The sentiment in the NFT community is that [a number of collections] likely won’t recover and that this is a dead cat bounce. I expect prices to continue to bleed out until these collections find floors in the low few hundred dollar range,” Petscher said.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume rose 10.37% to US$26.49 million as of 11:10 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to Cryptoslam data.

As Positivo explains, however, storing one’s crypto as a list of 12 words is very obvious to hackers or thieves who come across the list.\n\nColors, by contrast, "are everywhere." A private key could be hidden in plain sight, and a thief wouldn’t be the wiser.\n\n“A paper with 12 words is more suspicious than a color palette labeled like \'my new home wall colors,\' for example, or inside a styles.css of your [website],” he said.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe colors generated by the tool are expressed as a hex color code, a six-digit system that represents virtually any color as some combination of red, blue, and green. These colors can be stored across “several files,” Positivo explained, including HTML, CSS, or the color palette of a PNG.\n\nUnlike the word-based system, one need not remember the “order” of the colors to recover one’s seed: all that matters is that all colors are present.

The news articles suggest a mixed sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, with bullish predictions for Bitcoin's price reaching $120,000 by 2024 and 2025, driven by miners hoarding coins and reducing supply. However, Bitcoin's current price fell below $30,100, along with a plunge in Litecoin and Solana prices.

What has been holding Bitcoin back you think the most? I wasn't when I predicted it because I was at 4000. So it's gone to 30,000 in that time. And I wasn't really expecting the U.S. bureaucracy to be this aggressive. And I thought that maybe they would be recognizing that they've got to compete with the rest of the world. They've got to provide a platform from which entrepreneurs can can flourish. And by having this regulation, by enforcement that the SCC has been professing and driving, it's really driving all the great entrepreneurs out. And I think that that is that has hurt the Bitcoin price. But but Bitcoin is here to stay. It's a great it's a great system, it's a great currency, it's a great way to operate. I can't wait until I can raise a fund all in Bitcoin, invest it all on Bitcoin. And my my portfolio companies all pay their employees and suppliers all in Bitcoin and have taxes all paid in Bitcoin and have the waterfall all fall into people's bitcoin wallets because then there's no accounting, there's no auditing, there's no bookkeeping. It's all done on the blockchain and it's all honest and it's all straight. And I think that that is going to be that's going to bring society to an anthropological leap forward. It's going to be an amazing time and I can't wait for it. I guess I thought that it was going to happen a little sooner than it did. I also thought retailers would recognize that they can save 2% by accepting Bitcoin, and I thought they'd recognize that sooner. But that hasn't happened yet, and I think it's going to happen about the right time, about the same time as that happening. And maybe we'll get my price target then. Tim, a lot of you know, a lot of the OG Bitcoiners have sort of given up on the transactional piece of it on the currency side of it, looking at it more as a store of wealth like digital gold, why are you still pushing that that use case and how would it work? Would you use the Lightning Network or some other software patch to make it faster and more efficient? Yeah, I think when people talk about using Bitcoin as a store of value and that that being the only use, what they're missing is that the Lightning Network can operate on chain. So all these people who talk about Bitcoin using too much energy or it's too slow or whatever, they're missing that. When you move it off to the Lightning Network and maybe with open Node or whatever, it can do 5000 transactions a second and it doesn't require a lot of energy. And and I think that as the software starts being built for the smart contracts on Bitcoin, when ETFs are more targeted toward Bitcoin, they're calling for calling them ordinal, not ETFs, foreign entities. Yes, there were a lot of credibility and BlackRock guys are going to be doing it, but the nav ts, one CnF, ts or ordinal become a part of Bitcoin. And when when it does start focusing around Bitcoin, I think you're going to start seeing the real flourishing of Bitcoin. And and I think FDX sent us a very strong message that we don't want centralized currencies of any kind and we don't want I mean, we don't want a central bank, we don't want centralized currencies of any kind because they can be controlled by one person and that one person can take us off a cliff."}, {'id': 50, 'time': 'Tue, 11 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ault Alliance Is Exploring Initiative to Distribute Special Dividend Payable in Bitcoin - Yahoo Finance', 'content': 'LAS VEGAS, July 11, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ault Alliance, Inc.

The Company intends to collaborate with regulatory authorities, its transfer agent and others, which may include a trusted custodian, to determine what is required in order to pay a special dividend in Bitcoin.\n\nThe planned dividend would be paid from Bitcoin generated by the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, BitNile, Inc. ("BNI"). As previously announced, BNI issued an unaudited update on its Bitcoin mining operations reporting BNI’s mining operations is currently operating at an operational hash rate of 2.1 exahashes per second with approximately 9,000 of its Bitcoin miners at its Michigan data center and 10,000 Bitcoin miners that are being hosted through its strategic collaboration with Core Scientific, Inc.

With the increasing popularity and adoption of cryptocurrencies, Ault Alliance recognizes the potential of Bitcoin as a valuable asset for its stockholders. The idea of potentially issuing a Bitcoin dividend is aimed at providing a forward-thinking approach to stockholder value enhancement. By leveraging its Bitcoin mining operations, Ault Alliance seeks to provide an alternative investment opportunity and potential long-term value appreciation for its stockholders.\n\nAult Alliance is also exploring ways to facilitate the effectuation of its conceptual design for stockholders who may not be familiar or comfortable with receiving a dividend in Bitcoin itself. Ault Alliance would, with the intention of addressing the preferences of all of its stockholders, accomplish this objective by offering its stockholders as of the ex-dividend date a choice of receiving actual Bitcoin or a cash payment equal to the dollar value of the Bitcoin as of such ex-dividend date.\n\nStory continues\n\n"By exploring a possible Bitcoin dividend, we aim to stay at the forefront of technological advancements and provide additional value to our stockholders," said Milton "Todd" Ault III, Founder and Executive Chairman of Ault Alliance. "We believe that cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, hold tremendous potential for the future, and we want our stockholders to benefit from this exciting opportunity."\n\nIn order to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and promote transparency, Ault Alliance will be working closely with relevant regulatory authorities throughout the process. The Company is committed to adhering to the highest standards of corporate governance and regulatory compliance in all its operations. At this time, the Company has not declared a dividend and there can be no assurances that it will declare a dividend payable in Bitcoin or a Bitcoin-denominated cash payment, if at all. The Company has not yet determined what procedures would be required to permit stockholders to receive a dividend in Bitcoin, and even if the Company is able to pay a special dividend in Bitcoin, there are no guarantees that all stockholders will be permitted by their local governmental bodies to receive the dividend in Bitcoin.\n\nAult Alliance notes that all estimates and other projections are subject to the volatility in Bitcoin market price, the fluctuation in the mining difficulty level, the ability to build out and provide the necessary power for miners, and other factors that may impact the results of Bitcoin mining production or operations.\n\nFor more information on Ault Alliance and its subsidiaries, Ault Alliance recommends that stockholders, investors, and any other interested parties read Ault Alliance’s public filings and press releases available under the Investor Relations section at https://www.ault.com/ or available at https://www.sec.gov/.\n\nAbout Ault Alliance, Inc.\n\nAult Alliance, Inc. is a diversified holding company pursuing growth by acquiring undervalued businesses and disruptive technologies with a global impact.

The Mediterranean sun bounces off the bright white stucco walls of the house, illuminating the orange terracotta roof and casting a glow over Taihuttu, who sits on a plastic chair tucked under a round table of the same make. The Dutch patriarch of the Bitcoin Family drinks black coffee and pores over cryptocurrency price charts on his MacBook Pro as he decides which trades will begin his day. "We just need a few thousand per month to live on so our performance is not really important to us," Taihuttu tells CNBC from his deck overlooking an expansive stretch of cobalt-colored water, cliff-backed beaches and bougainvillea.\n\nTaihuttu\'s family home in Lagos, Portugal. MacKenzie Sigalos\n\nTaihuttu\'s self-effacement and modest surroundings belie the 45-year-old\'s success. In 2017, Taihuttu, along with his wife and three kids, liquidated all their assets, trading a 2,500-square-foot house and most of their earthly possessions for bitcoin and a life on the road. This was back when the price of bitcoin was about $900. Bitcoin is currently trading at over $30,000, down from an all-time high of nearly $70,000 in November 2021. Those extreme price swings have helped grow the Dutch family\'s crypto nest egg. For seven years, the investor has regularly been swapping his bitcoin for U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins to capitalize on the volatility in the price of the world\'s largest cryptocurrency. When Taihuttu thinks bitcoin is reaching a bull market peak, he trades his bitcoin into stablecoins such as tether, USDC and DAI. When it appears as though bitcoin is touching cycle lows during a bear market, he starts buying it back. So far, Taihuttu says the gamble is working out great thanks to a market indicator he created himself dubbed the Didi BAM BAM.\n\nDidi Taihuttu in Lagos, Portugal. MacKenzie Sigalos\n\nTaihuttu\'s indicator considers a mix of inputs, including directional trading data and moon cycles. It has guided all of Taihuttu\'s investing decisions since he built it before the Covid-19 pandemic. "From mid-November to the start of December 2022, we saw the first signs the bear market was completely over," said Taihuttu. "It was confirmed in January 2023 when the long flag appeared in the model." He added, "People should have been buying bitcoin already, because every bitcoin you bought at $16k, it\'s at $30k now, so that\'s almost 90% upside." The father of three says his bitcoin investment is up about 50% since the bottom of the most recent bear market. The Taihuttus declined to share with CNBC the current dollar amount of their crypto investment in aggregate. But Taihuttu did disclose that they had fully bought back into bitcoin by the time the coin surpassed the $19,000 price threshold, so they\'re "not doing so bad." It also helps that the nomadic family\'s primary domicile is in Portugal — Europe\'s ultimate crypto tax haven. "You don\'t pay any capital gains tax or anything else in Portugal on cryptocurrency," said Taihuttu. "As long as you don\'t earn cryptocurrency for providing services in Portugal, you\'re in the clear." "That\'s a very beautiful bitcoin heaven," he said.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards Didi Taihuttu in Lagos, Portugal. Didi Taihuttu\n\nHow the BAM BAM indicator works\n\nWhen Taihuttu began day trading tokens, he initially turned to traditional predictive metrics such as the stock-to-flow model and the Mayer Multiple — a measure calculated by dividing the current price of bitcoin by the 200-day moving average to help identify frothy moments in the market when an asset\'s value eclipses its intrinsic value. But spending the time reading the tea leaves of all these somewhat-related measures didn\'t seem like a particularly productive use of his time, so Taihuttu decided to create his own proprietary blend of the best indicators on the market. "It\'s not just enough to know which indicators go into a formula," explained Taihuttu. "What you can\'t see is the calculus and the code that implements over the stock conditions. Those calculations display in charts." Beginning in 2019, Taihuttu started to incubate and perfect a custom-built predictive trading tool that would weigh multiple technical indicators — plus a bit of astrology — and then spit out real-time insights into potential price swings. "It\'s a combination of Bollinger Bands, Lower and Upper Bands, NMA, Red/Green Ribbon, NormStoch, RSI, Price Oscillator, Plot, MACD, Cross, Chande Momentum Oscillator, RSI-EMA, Full Moon and New Moon," explained Taihuttu, naming a dozen of the most popular market signals that crypto traders watch when they make investment decisions.

Therefore, I would recommend a conservative trading action with a confidence level of 0.3, indicating a cautious approach to navigate the uncertain market conditions. This decision reflects the importance of prioritizing long-term strategies over short-term gains to maximize overall profit and manage risks effectively in the volatile cryptocurrency market.

However, it now says the fund is “on track” to launch this month, having decided that last year “the time wasn’t right” following the Terra Luna cryptocurrency crash in May 2022 and crypto exchange FTX’s collapse in November.\n\nThe asset manager says “demand has shifted since last summer”.\n\nIn Europe all digital assets exchange traded products so far have been structured as exchange traded notes, rather than funds.\n\nThis article was previously published by Ignites Europe, a title owned by the FT Group.\n\nEach ETF shareholder owns a portion of a fund’s underlying shares, while investors in ETNs own a debt security, not the underlying assets.\n\nJacobi has made much of the fact that it is launching an ETF rather than an exchange traded note.\n\nPeter Lane, co-founder and chief operating officer of Jacobi, told Ignites Europe last year that structured note issuers were guilty of “misuse” of the ETF term.\n\n“There has been so much misinformation and misuse of the term ETF by [ETN] issuers, presumably to obfuscate the risks that are inherent in acquiring and investing in ETNs,” he said.\n\nJacobi said its ETF, unlike ETNs, cannot be leveraged or use derivatives, which could otherwise lead to “significant counterparty risk”.\n\nThe fund has been authorised in Guernsey, a jurisdiction that offers “a number of advantages” to help the launch of a bitcoin fund, said David Crosland, a partner in offshore law firm Carey Olsen.\n\n“As a specialist fund servicing jurisdiction that is not subject to the inherent inflexibilities of being an EU member, Guernsey was able to move quickly to adapt to support this launch,” he said.\n\n“[Guernsey’s] flexibility and willingness to understand the complex detail has allowed the promoter to launch a fund vehicle that benefits from regulated fund status when other European jurisdictions are unable to do so,” Crosland added.\n\nMichael O’Riordan, founding partner of ETF and digital assets consultancy Blackwater Search and Advisory, said the regulatory challenges of launching a bitcoin ETF in Europe were “very large” as bitcoin was not considered an eligible asset under Ucits rules.\n\n“However, in practice, apart from some structural differences, the ETF and the ETP are quite similar,” he said.\n\n“As an industry, we have not done a good job at distinguishing each and as a result there is a lot of confusion in the market as to which is which,” O’Riordan added.\n\nNet flows into European digital assets ETPs over the past 18 months amounted to $483mn, including inflows of $398mn in the third quarter of 2022 alone, according to data from Coinbase and Bloomberg.\n\nAssets in European digital assets ETPs stand at €4.3bn, having peaked at €10.5bn at the end of 2021, according to Ignites Europe analysis of Morningstar data.\n\n*Ignites Europe is a news service published by FT Specialist for professionals working in the asset management industry.

The cryptocurrency is up about 84% so far this year (as of Jul 10, 2023).\n\nMeanwhile, Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF WGMI, Crypto Industry Innovators ETF BITQ, Invesco Alerian Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF SATO and Global X Blockchain & Bitcoin Strategy ETF BITS added about 244.8%, 172.2%, 161.4% and 124.8%, respectively, so far this year (as of Jul 10, 2023).\n\nThis divergence in price performance is primarily attributed to a less-hawkish Fed which helped growth stocks like bitcoin miners. Increased transaction fees, prominent issuers’ interest in launching a bitcoin ETF also acted as drivers in boosting those stocks. If these were not enough, the leveraged beta effect, which tends to boost mining stocks more than the underlying asset, played a key role.\n\nHowever, the likelihood of interest rate hikes left investors wondering if mining stocks can maintain their upward trajectory in the second half of the year. Let’s delve a little deeper.\n\nFears of Higher Rates Weigh on Crypto Stocks\n\nThe Fed's efforts to curb inflation through interest rate hikes have caused uncertainties for high-risk assets like digital currencies. In past one week, bitcoin remained almost flat. While this decline may be a short-term correction, a resilient U.S. labor market strengthens rate hike expectations, alarming Bitcoin's future.\n\nWhat Are Silver Linings?\n\nBlackrock, WisdomTree and Invesco Plan to Launch Bitcoin ETFs: The filing of spot ETF applications by renowned asset managers fueled a growing interest in cryptocurrencies from institutional and corporate clients. While the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been in denial for a Bitcoin ETF for long, the filings represent a significant step towards widespread adoption. The world’s largest asset manager BlackRock’s plans to launch a bitcoin ETF in June influenced the entire space. Two other large investment firms now joined the queue, WisdomTree and Invesco.\n\nStory continues\n\nTraditional Finance Giants Explore Crypto Space: Renowned financial institutions, including Charles Schwab, Fidelity, and Citadel Securities, have partnered to launch EDX Markets, a crypto exchange platform. EDX Markets, which had faced delays due to regulatory uncertainty, has finally listed major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash.\n\nInstitutional Adoption: Institutions such as JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, which were against virtual currencies before, have started implementing them into their systems. This is a sign of growing acceptance among institutional investors.\n\nFavorable Regulations in the Cards?Though the SEC’s stance toward cryptocurrency has been adverse so far, back-to-back efforts in launching an ETF from reported issuers stirred speculation that such intuitional initiatives might compel legislative institutions to figure out how to classify and regulate them.\n\nPositive Outlook for Bitcoin Mining Companies: Bitcoin mining stocks are well-positioned for growth. Mining companies have been making expansion moves, increasing their hash rates, and planning to acquire more mining machines. Such companies include Hut 8 Mining, Riot Platforms and Cleanspark. In fact, bitcoin hash rate hit a new all-time high amid weakening prices.\n\nBitcoin Having Expected in 2024: Halving events, which occur about every four years, lower the mining rewards by half. The resulting shortage of newly mined BTC has historically played a crucial role in driving price rallies. As the having event looms in 2024, traders are tightening their belts for a new cycle. So, there is high chance of an upward momentum for Bitcoin.\n\nCheaper Valuation: Last year, bitcoin was thrashed as rising rates weighed on speculative and growth investments. This has helped the crypto block to bounce back with all force.\n\nSustainability Parameter: Cryptocurrencies are being promoted as an eco-friendlier investment. Sustainability concerns are in vogue lately as the global investing world is concerned about climate change.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Grayscale Investments has been trying to launch a spot bitcoin ETF since 2016 and has yet to get approval. Now, its calling out the Securities and Exchange Commission over its approval of a leveraged bitcoin futures ETF. Grayscale Investments CEO Michael Sonnenshein joints Yahoo Finance Live to discuss his company's efforts to get a spot bitcoin ETF approved.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nSEANA SMITH: All right, Bitcoin has soared over the last month on hopes that regulators are going to finally approve a spot Bitcoin ETF. We're looking at gains of just about almost 17% in the price of Bitcoin getting a boost after BlackRock filed paperwork with the SEC last month sparking a new wave of optimism and several institutions followed.\n\nWhile Grayscale has been trying to get approval for a spot market ETF since 2016, its last request was denied. Now the company is calling out the SEC. For more on this, we want to bring in Michael Sonnenshein, Grayscale Investments CEO.\n\nMichael, it's great to see you. And I want to bring up the letter that you recently sent. And we have a full screen here to show exactly what you are laying out. You sent a letter to the DC Court of Appeals questioning the SEC's decision to approve a leveraged Bitcoin future ETF after previously denying a spot Bitcoin ETF. So lay out your case here and why these two decisions don't add up.\n\nMICHAEL SONNENSHEIN: Absolutely. Well, it's great to be back on the show. I would say that this really comes down to the core argument. When the SEC denied our application to convert GBTC into an ETF, we immediately filed a lawsuit challenging that decision.\n\nAnd the argument that really underpins that is that the SEC has approved, not one, but several Bitcoin futures-based ETFs-- futures are a derivative of that underlying spot market-- but continued to deny, including GBTC, spot Bitcoin applications from coming to market.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd those arguments were presented to the court. We believe that they're common sense and compelling arguments. But the SEC now has gone on and continued to even go further into this arbitrary behavior by now approving a leveraged Bitcoin futures ETF which, in the actual prospectus itself, outlines that that's an even riskier product, right?\n\nAnd so we do feel here that investors should have choice, right? They should be able to use Bitcoin futures ETFs. They should be able to use spot Bitcoin ETFs, really whatever's going to fit their mandate as an investor.\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: Michael, why do you think the SEC has been so reluctant. I mean, what's your read on what is driving or what's motivating the SEC to put the brake?\n\nMICHAEL SONNENSHEIN: Well, I can really only point to what they've said in their denials, right? The SEC has been looking for a market that is surveyable, a market that maybe has the qualities and characteristics of other markets that they're used to seeing.\n\nThat being said, there are new conversations being had around surveillance-sharing agreements and other types of constructs that maybe the SEC will be persuaded by, but time, I think, will tell.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Michael, many though are looking at the approval of the leveraged Bitcoin futures ETF as a positive step forward given the fact that then maybe this makes it a little bit more likely that the SEC is going to approve a Bitcoin spot ETF, do you share in that view?\n\nMICHAEL SONNENSHEIN: Well, I think there's been a recent wave of ETF applications that have come in and part of that optimism really does revolve around the GBTC lawsuit. We've been transparent with the market that we expect a decision from the court sometime. It could be as soon as over the next few weeks, but probably by the fall the latest.\n\nAnd so there's a lot of issuers that have been looking at-- Not only has GBTC kind of laid the groundwork and become a place where many investors have gotten their Bitcoin exposure, but it's now the framework upon which they're basing their operations, their disclosure, et cetera. So they believe that that, in fact, could be a catalyst if a favorable outcome is reached, there.\n\nAnd it continues to show that investor interest and appetite for this asset class isn't going away and the continuation of Bitcoin futures, Bitcoin-leveraged futures ETFs, these are all additional access points that investors now have.\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: Michael, it's been what? More than eight months now since we saw really just the collapse of FTX. And there were a lot of concerns, conversations around that time about what the future of crypto will look like.\n\nI mean, you've got institutional names now trying to get in with the spot Bitcoin ETF and really the opportunity is there as well. But what do you think has evolved in the thinking within the crypto space and does that ultimately strengthen the case for investment into something like Bitcoin?\n\nMICHAEL SONNENSHEIN: You know, it's great..."}]

Yahoo Finance Markets Reporter Jared Blikre checks out bitcoin's price action amid regulatory pressures.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n- Well, amid the surge in tech stocks, small caps, and government bonds, one asset class isn't participating in the latest run up. Bitcoin has held a tight trading range over the last three weeks as the industry braces for a critical decision in federal court, where Grayscale Investments, the manager of the world's largest publicly traded crypto fund is suing the SEC to allow a spot Bitcoin ETF to operate in the US market.\n\nYahoo Finance's Jared Blikre is here with those details. Hey, Jared.\n\nJARED BLIKRE: Hey, there. And I thought before I got into the court case, I just begin with a year to date look at what's happening in cryptocurrency land. Bitcoin, up 85%. But as you said, Rachelle, we haven't seen a lot of that price action made recently. This is a-- let's see, let's get a year to date chart on there. And you can see over the last three weeks, basically treading water going sideways.\n\nHowever, given the fact that we are in the upper right hand side of this chart, this consolidation is actually bullish. And when you see what's overhead, let me put a three-year chart, the most price action in Bitcoin is lying directly ahead. And that's basically 30,000 to 40,000, goes up to maybe 50,000. But a ton of price memory in there. So not surprising to see Bitcoin at least taking a pause, and it could still reverse.\n\nBut back to the main point. This court case that we were talking about, Grayscale versus the SEC, they want to sue the SEC in order to allow them to convert into an ETF. They are currently an ETN, it gets into the weeds there. But they want to be able to be based their reference price on spot Bitcoin.\n\nAnd we saw in anticipation of a decision of that in this case, we saw BlackRock file for a Bitcoin ETF, a spot Bitcoin ETF only a few weeks ago. Then a bunch of other issuers piled on. Fidelity did as well, and they just issued a note, they just filed an amendment only today or yesterday with regard to their previous amendments. So things are moving along there. But is it going to be approved? Is the spot Bitcoin ETF going to be approved on its own merits or is it going to be forced and shoehorned in because of this court case? We don't know.\n\nBut nevertheless, Bitcoin poised-- poised, I should, say to break higher. But as we know in crypto, anything can happen.\n\n- It's true, we're always waiting for that breakout moment here, still waiting for it. But thank you for getting us up to speed, our very own Jared Blikre there."}, {'id': 45, 'time': 'Thu, 13 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Bitcoin, Ether surge after Ripple notched partial win against SEC; Ripple's XRP leads crypto rally - Yahoo Finance", 'content': 'Bitcoin surged on Friday morning in Asia to breach the US$31,000 resistance level, after Ripple Labs achieved a partial victory in its three-year lawsuit against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The regulator accused Ripple of offering XRP as an unregistered security. Along with Bitcoin, Ether and all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies logged considerable gains, with XRP spearheading the rally with a rise of over 70%. U.S. equity futures traded flat in the Asia time zone on Friday as investors await earnings reports from major U.S. banks. Thursday’s U.S. producer price index (PPI) has added to a sense that inflation is slowing in the country.\n\nXRP ruling provides crypto market boost\n\nBitcoin climbed 3.45% over the last 24 hours to US$31,463 as of 07:50 a.m. in Hong Kong for a weekly gain of 4.93%, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world’s largest cryptocurrency reached a high of US$31,814 early Friday morning, the highest price since June 2022.\n\nIn a summary judgement on Thursday, New York Southern District Court Judge Analisa Torres ruled that Ripple’s programmatic sales of the XRP token on public exchanges do not constitute securities, marking a partial victory for Ripple with the SEC. The regulator first sued the San Francisco-based financial technology firm on the grounds that XRP constitutes a security in 2020.\n\nThe verdict came with a critical caveat, however. The court ruled that Ripple’s XRP sales to institutional investors did violate securities laws.\n\nNonetheless, Ripple’s Chief Executive Officer Stuart Alderoty called the judgement “a huge win” in a Friday tweet.\n\nA huge win today – as a matter of law – XRP is not a security. Also a matter of law – sales on exchanges are not securities. Sales by executives are not securities. Other XRP distributions – to developers, to charities, to employees are not securities. — Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) July 13, 2023\n\nAlderoty said that “the only thing the Court found constitutes an investment contract is past direct XRP sales to institutional clients.” Those transactions will now be subject to further court proceedings.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite the overall optimism in the crypto community evidenced by the upswing in the market, there are also a number of industry voices sounding a note of caution.\n\nIn an emailed comment, CoinShares’ Head of Product Townsend Lansing said that the aspect of the ruling that identifies Ripple’s sales to institutional customers as a violation of securities law marks “a considerable victory for the SEC.”\n\nThe ruling will now set a precedent for legal action against other cryptocurrencies by regulators, he said.\n\n“It is important to note that institutional investors who purchased directly from Ripple may find themselves subject to class-action litigation as potential underwriters,” Lansing added. “This is an area to watch closely, especially if big-name venture capitalists were involved.”\n\nBut, while some sense of jeopardy remained for those involved, Justin d’Anethan, head of APAC business development at Belgium-based crypto market maker Keyrock, believes that the ruling had at least “shook investors in the best of ways.”\n\nElsewhere, Europe’s first Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is set for a public listing this month. That follows a 12-month delay from the initially planned date, the Financial Times reported on Thursday.\n\nExperts have identified the listing as another potential catalyst for the crypto market.\n\n“With the talks of ETFs in the background, the idea that we could see products tracking many cryptocurrencies is not implausible and traders are naturally positioning themselves accordingly,” said Keyrock’s d’Anethan.\n\nLike Bitcoin, Ether surged 6.99% to US$2,004, moving up 7.69% for the week. The token is trading above US$2,000 for the first time since April.\n\nBoosted by the ruling on the SEC-Ripple case, all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies rose in the past 24 hours. Cardano’s ADA, Solana’s SOL and Polygon’s MATIC each logged two-digit gains.\n\nXRP, subject of the SEC’s lawsuit against issuer Ripple, jumped 72.75% to US$0.8142 and added 74.89% for the week. In doing so, it replaced Binance’s BNB as the third largest non-stablecoin cryptocurrency by market cap.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization rose 6.19% in the past 24 hours to US$1.26 trillion, while trading volume jumped 95.72% to US$60.3 billion.\n\nForkast 500 up, Dapper Labs announces layoffs\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index edged up 0.14% in the past 24 hours to 2,699.39 as of 09:55 a.m. in Hong Kong.

The break above $31,000, he said, doesn\'t seem "particularly convincing at this stage."\n\nThe sudden drop in prices caught traders who bet on higher prices off-guard, with $155 million of long positions liquidated, according to CoinGlass data. This was the largest long liquidation in a month.\n\nUPDATE (Jul. 14, 19:20 UTC): Updated prices through the story.

Altcoins like XRP, SOL, MATIC and ADA chalked out double-digit gains, outshining bitcoin by a big margin.\n\nSome observers foresee potential for a continue outperformance of altcoins over the near term.\n\n"Alt season may be upon us following the Ripple news as indicators collectively suggest risk appetite is funneling down the risk continuum," Decentral Park Capital said in a market update published Thursday. "With the U.S. dollar breaking down and the inflation battle nearing the end, it appears to be game on for investors."\n\nIn contrast, Noelle Acheson, author of the Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, said the ruling could help Coinbase in its legal tussle with the SEC, but cautioned against predicting an outsized altcoin rally.\n\nEarly last month, the SEC charged cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase and its offshore rival Binance for offering unregistered securities, a move that injected uncertainty into the market.\n\n"The ruling should be enough to reawaken greater interest in the shifting market narrative, which itself could be enough to bring in new flows," Acheson told CoinDesk.\n\nStory continues\n\n"However, it\'s premature to assume that a \'win\' is in the bag – the SEC will likely appeal the decision, and given some of the inconsistencies, it might win. At best, the uncertainty will drag on for longer. So, it feels too soon for alt season; that will probably wait until we get greater clarity on the Coinbase case," Acheson said.\n\nIn a note to clients on Friday, analysts at K33 Research voiced a similar opinion, saying, "the ruling will be appealed and might even be reversed, so we expect the ongoing battle to continue."\n\nThe court also found Ripple violated securities law when selling XRP directly to institutions. So institutions that bought XRP can come under the regulatory scanner, injecting further uncertainty into the market.\n\n"It is important to note that institutional investors who purchased directly from Ripple may find themselves subject to class-action litigation as potential underwriters. This is an area to watch closely, especially if big-name venture capitalists were involved," CoinShares’ head of product, Townsend Lansing, said. "The legal landscape continues to change, and we urge all parties to stay informed of these important developments."'}, {'id': 20, 'time': 'Fri, 14 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "XRP leads gains as Bitcoin, top 10 cryptos rally after Ripple's win against U.S. SEC - Yahoo Finance", 'content': 'Bitcoin and all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies gained in Friday afternoon trading in Asia. The gains come after Ripple Labs achieved a partial victory on Thursday when a U.S. court ruled that Ripple Labs’ programmatic sales of the XRP cryptocurrency did not qualify as the offer and sale of investment contracts. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2020 accused Ripple of offering XRP as an unregistered security. The judgment marks a significant milestone in the three-year legal tussle between the San Francisco-based payments firm and the U.S. regulator.

Ether strengthened 6.46% to US$1,991 and rose 7.26% in the last seven days.\n\nBoosted by the ruling on the SEC-Ripple case, XRP led a rally in the crypto market on Friday, rising 62.71% to US$0.7674 and bringing its weekly gains to 65.47%.\n\nIn a summary judgment on Thursday, New York Southern District Court Judge Analisa Torres ruled that Ripple’s programmatic sales of the XRP token on public exchanges do not constitute securities, but the verdict also said that Ripple’s XRP sales to institutional investors violated securities laws.\n\nThe SEC first sued the San Francisco-based financial technology firm in 2020 on the grounds that XRP constituted a security.\n\nRipple’s chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty called the judgment “a huge win” in a tweet on Friday. “The only thing the Court found constitutes an investment contract is past direct XRP sales to institutional clients. There will be further court proceedings only on these institutional sales per the Court’s order,” Alderoty said.\n\nMaybe we can now start a rational conversation about crypto regulation in this country. — Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) July 13, 2023\n\nCoinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the U.S., said in a tweet that it is reopening trading of XRP. Other crypto exchanges like Crypto.com also tweeted that it is enabling XRP trading, while Kraken Pro said on Twitter that XRP is “back in full-trading mode” on its platform.\n\nStory continues\n\n“This can be considered a win because XRP is one of the more centralized foundations, with a prominent figurehead who offered standard sales via exchanges, and formal distribution programs. If XRP is not considered a security, nearly nothing sold via exchanges is,” Vincent Chok, CEO of Hong Kong-based consultancy First Digital, told Forkast in an emailed response.\n\n“If the court states that XRP is not a security, it strengthens the case for many other tokens that the SEC considers a security. The SEC has tried the regulation by enforcement tactic, but this ruling might make it think twice about its past approach,” Chok added.\n\nHowever, according to Ben Caselin, vice president and chief strategy officer at Dubai-based crypto trading platform MaskEX, the court’s ruling might be cause for some relief among investors, but this tug-of-war is far from over.\n\n“Due to their peer-to-peer and digital native nature, cryptocurrencies do not easily allow for regulation in the traditional sense, but, going forward, if projects and companies who issue tokens want to deal with the general public and institutional investors, they might want to practice more caution compared to a few years ago,” Caselin told Forkast in an emailed response.\n\nXRP’s 24-hour trading volume soared 1,743.38% to US$13.27 billion, while its market capitalization strengthened 64.52% to US$40.85 billion.\n\nThe verdict on the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit also boosted prices of all top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies.\n\nCardano’s ADA token gained 22.88% to US$0.3526, bringing its weekly gains to 25.91%.

Robinhood Markets, Inc. rose 15% this week, its best in nearly a year, and Bakkt Holdings Inc. gained 30%. Bitcoin mining companies such as Marathon Digital Holdings, Hut 8 Mining Corp., Riot Platforms, Inc. and Cipher Mining Inc. also saw weekly gains, even as some sold off Friday.\n\nThursday’s ruling that the Ripple Labs Inc. token is a security when sold to institutional investors — but not the general public — was the biggest contributor to gains. The decision added to optimism over Bitcoin ETF applications that lifted investor spirits and Bitcoin earlier in the week.\n\n“This is a positive read-through to COIN as it sets precedent that crypto token sales through exchanges, at least in the XRP case, did not violate securities laws,” Needham analyst John Todaro wrote in a note, boosting his price target to $120 from $70 on the buy-rated stock. “We believe this outcome should moderately de-risk the regulatory pressure on the stock.”\n\nOf course, the ruling was specific to Ripple and shouldn’t be hastily applied across the industry, Benjamin Salisbury of Height Capital Markets said in a note.\n\n“We note that the ruling is specific to facts in this case alone and caution against applying this ruling to the Coinbase lawsuit broadly,” Salisbury said. “We also expect the SEC to appeal the ruling, given the potential implications for securities laws.”\n\nOutside of regulations, short covering may also be lifting crypto-linked stocks whose 2023 rallies have set up contrarian traders to be squeezed.\n\nIn the last month, short sellers bought back $407 million worth of Coinbase shares to exit their positions, according to data from S3 Partners LLC. This year, Coinbase shorts have paper losses of $2.9 billion, making it the seventh least-profitable short behind Tesla Inc., Nvidia Corp., Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., S3 said.'}, {'id': 19, 'time': 'Sat, 15 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Bitcoin Miners Face 'Stress Test' in Next Halving: JP Morgan - Yahoo Finance", 'content': 'Bitcoin miners will face headwinds as the hash rate reaches new record highs ahead of the upcoming halving event next spring, with volatile electricity costs and competition among miners pushing up the cost of production, according to analysts at global financial giant JP Morgan.\n\nHash rate refers to the computational power used to mine a cryptocurrency. The halving event, which occurs roughly every four years, will reduce miners\' rewards by half.\n\n"The upcoming bitcoin halving event in April/May 2024 could be a stress test for Bitcoin miners," writes JP Morgan analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou and colleagues in the firm\'s latest Flows and Liquidity report, which the firm shared with Decrypt.\n\n"[It] would reduce the issuance rewards from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC, implying a reduction in miners’ revenue, effectively increasing Bitcoin’s production cost at the same time," the report explains. "As a result, while Bitcoin halving is seen as having a positive effect on the bitcoin price given the production cost acted historically as a floor, it poses a challenge for bitcoin miners."\n\nBerenberg Analysts: Bitcoin \'Could Rally\' Near Next Year\'s Halving Event\n\nAccording to the analysis, and based on a global average cost of electricity of $0.05/kWh, it costs around $20,000 to mine a Bitcoin, which is currently worth around $30,000, per CoinGecko. But JP Morgan said the volatility of the hash rate points to the use of a variety of energy sources, meaning miners with access to lower-priced power have an advantage.\n\nIn fact, the company said, a one-cent increase in the cost per kilowatt hour translates to a $4,300 increase in the cost of Bitcoin production.\n\n"Post halving this sensitivity would double to $8,600, thus increasing the vulnerability of higher-cost producers," the firm noted.\n\nThere has been some good news for miners, however.\n\nVanguard Now Owns $560 Million Worth of Bitcoin Mining Stocks\n\nStory continues\n\n"Institutional interest in bitcoin mining has provided support to struggling miners, with investments in mining rigs from companies like Galaxy Digital and Grayscale Investments," it observed. Galaxy Digital recently acquired a major mining facility from Argo Blockchain, and Grayscale spun off an entity focused on Bitcoin mining hardware.\n\n"Tether, the world largest stablecoin issuer, also plans an investment in a bitcoin mining site in El Salvador," according to the report.\n\nNonetheless, the price of Bitcoin and transaction fees will need to rise significantly to offset the lower block reward.\n\nJP Morgan also observed that "the decline in hype surrounding cryptocurrencies poses an additional challenge for miners\' revenues," including "the decline in the hype around Ordinals."\n\nThe number of daily Ordinals inscriptions recently hit an all-time high, but Bitcoin fees did not sustain earlier highs along with them.\n\n"Going forward, it seems unlikely that the Bitcoin hash rate will continue to rise at the same pace post the April/May 2024 halving event without any sustained rise in the Bitcoin price above its production cost or a large increase in transaction fees that could offset the reduction in issuance rewards," JP Morgan concluded.'}]

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
The cryptocurrency market experienced significant volatility over the weekend, with Bitcoin prices plummeting due to reports of Binance laying off 1,000 employees, causing a 2.7% loss in value. However, positive news surrounding a key ruling on Ripple's token being classified as a security for institutional investors but not the general public led to a surge in crypto-linked stocks like Coinbase and Robinhood, indicating investor optimism. Additionally, JP Morgan's analysis suggests that Bitcoin miners may face challenges ahead of the upcoming halving event in 2024, with increased production costs and declining hype around cryptocurrencies posing potential risks to miners' revenues. Overall, the market trend appears to be mixed, with potential short-term fluctuations driven by regulatory developments and mining dynamics.

Here's How High He Thinks It Can Go. - The Motley Fool", 'content': 'If there\'s anyone who can spot the future trends in the world of technology, it\'s venture capitalist Tim Draper. Draper is a co-founder of the VC firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson and has made hundreds of early investments in cutting-edge companies like Tesla.\n\nNow, the 65-year-old VC legend is making another big call on the world\'s largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC 0.97%) -- namely that it\'s about to take off. Here\'s how high Draper thinks the price can go.\n\nDelayed, but a big pop is coming\n\nDraper is not just a billionaire investor -- he\'s also been a Bitcoin enthusiast from the early years, when the token was still gaining traction. In 2014, Draper purchased 29,656 Bitcoin tokens that had been seized from the Silk Road online marketplace by U.S. Marshals. At the time, the price of Bitcoin was only $632, so Draper has already made an absolute killing.\n\nBut Draper thinks Bitcoin is just getting started. When it traded at around $4,000, Draper predicted that Bitcoin would be at $250,000 by now. While the price of Bitcoin currently hovers around $31,200, Draper is sticking to his prediction. "I guess we have to wait a little longer (maybe two years), but engineers are hard at work," he tweeted not long ago.\n\nSo what\'s the holdup? Well, in a recent interview with Bloomberg, Draper said he is surprised by how opposed agencies of the U.S. government such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have been toward the crypto industry.\n\nEarlier this year, the SEC sued Binance, the world\'s largest crypto exchange, and then Coinbase, the large crypto exchange in the U.S. The SEC is adamant that many cryptocurrencies should be treated as securities and therefore regulated under the purview of the SEC although SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has acknowledged previously that Bitcoin is not a security.\n\n"I thought that maybe they would be recognizing that they\'ve gotta compete with the rest of the world," Draper told Bloomberg, adding that regulators are "driving all the great entrepreneurs out."\n\nBut Draper believes that Bitcoin is here to stay for the long haul and that one day it will eventually become an everyday currency that will soon be more broadly accepted by retailers, which he thinks can reap many benefits from using the payments technology.\n\n"I can\'t wait until I can raise a fund all in Bitcoin, invest it all in Bitcoin, have my portfolio companies paid in Bitcoin, and have taxes all paid in Bitcoin, and have the waterfall all fall into people\'s Bitcoin wallets," Draper said.\n\nWill Draper\'s prediction come true?\n\nObviously, Draper is not the first notable investor to predict that Bitcoin will rise significantly, but he certainly does have a tremendous track record of anticipating future trends. He\'s also clearly got skin in the game.\n\nI would agree with Draper that Bitcoin is here to stay, and I\'ve said previously that it merits some exposure in one\'s portfolio, given that it does have a history of rising when the dollar drops and during difficult periods for the banking sector.\n\nHowever, I have no price prediction for the digital asset and am still unclear if everyone will be using it as a currency one day. Cryptocurrencies are hard to value as an asset, but given the continued adoption of Bitcoin in the mainstream financial system, I do envision a future with Bitcoin.'}, {'id': 10, 'time': 'Sun, 16 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Bitcoin dips over weekend, other top 10 cryptos mixed; US stock futures edge down - Yahoo Finance', 'content': 'Having slipped over the weekend, Bitcoin rose to trade at over US$30,300 on Monday morning in Asia. The price has now reverted to around the level posted last Thursday — prior to XRP issuer Ripple’s favorable ruling in its lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The partial victory led to significant gains for a number of top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies, with XRP still leading the gains. U.S. stock futures edged lower as investors await earnings reports from major banks.\n\nBitcoin falls back\n\nBitcoin edged up 0.05% over the last 24 hours to US$30,332.54 as of 06:30 a.m. in Hong Kong for a weekly gain of 0.65%, according to data from CryptoMarketCap.\n\nHowever, the world’s largest cryptocurrency was trading at around US$31,300 early Saturday morning. Following that weekend high, the token’s price reverted to roughly its pre-Ripple ruling level.\n\nIn a summary judgment Thursday, New York Southern District Court Judge Analisa Torres ruled that Ripple’s programmatic sales of the XRP token on public exchanges do not constitute securities. The regulator first sued the San Francisco-based financial technology firm on the grounds that XRP constitutes a security in 2020.\n\nThe ruling was deemed something of a partial victory for Ripple, however, as the court ruled that XRP sales to institutional investors did violate securities laws.\n\n“There will be further court proceedings on that part … It is also not yet known if the SEC will appeal to the ruling,” said Caroline Bowler, CEO of Australia-based crypto exchange BTC Markets, in emailed comments. Therefore, there remains the “potential for more insecurity ahead for Ripple,” Bowler added.\n\nNonetheless, Ripple Labs’ XRP led the gainers Monday morning in Asia. It rose 5.58% to US$0.7577 for a weekly surge of 61.56%.\n\nMeanwhile, the SEC has added BlackRock’s application for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) to its official docket. That decision means that the regulator will now review the proposal in a serious manner.\n\nStory continues\n\nBlackrock, the world’s largest asset manager with over US$9 trillion in assets, filed the application a little less than a month ago. The move saw the token’s value breach the US$31,000 resistance level earlier this month as multiple major asset managers followed suit with similar ETF proposals.\n\nEther also gained 0.20% to US$1,934.09, rising 3.81% in the past seven days.\n\nOther top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies were mixed. The day’s biggest losses were logged by Dogecoin, which dipped 2.53% to US$0.07. However, the token still recorded gains of 6.89% for the week.\n\nCardano’s ADA also fell 2.52% to US$0.3185, limiting the coin’s weekly gain to 12.08%. Similarly, Binance’s BNB lost 2.43% to US$244.95. It is nonetheless trading at 4.68% higher than a week ago.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization rose 0.16% in the past 24 hours to US$1.22 trillion, while trading volume fell 11.97% to US$24.91 billion.\n\nToken-gated access for the super-rich and The Flash via NFT\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the main Forkast 500 NFT index edged up 0.50% in the past 24 hours to 2,736.37 as of 09:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. However, the index is down 0.40% for the week. Forkast’s Solana and Cardano NFT market indices also moved higher, while the Ethereum and Polygon indices dropped.\n\n“NFTs continue to ride the wave of positive news and positive prices in crypto,” said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News. “However we’re not seeing any noteworthy gains in projects and instead most of the big names are still down for the past 7 days.”\n\nThat is despite some large CryptoPunk and Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) sales in the past week. Those sales included BAYC #1734, which sold for $1.2m (600ETH), CryptoPunk #8531 for $1m (550 ETH), and CryptoPunk #9476 for $403k (217.5 ETH).\n\n“Big sales sometimes trickle liquidity to other projects, but in this case, the seller may be pocketing their gains or investing in crypto, where opportunities seem brighter at the moment,” Petscher said.\n\nIn the past 24 hours, the total NFT transaction volume dipped 10.93% to US$16.58 million, according to data from CryptoSlam.\n\nImmutableX’s Gods Unchained Cards, the collection of NFTs used in Immutable’s trading card game of the same name, topped the 24-hour transaction volume, despite edging down 0.43% to US$690,896.\n\nEthereum-based NFT staple BAYC placed second in Cryptoslam’s collections ranking.

SEC officials reportedly expressed concern that the original ETF applications filed by BlackRock and other asset managers were not sufficiently comprehensive.\n\nTo convince the regulators, BlackRock has added a “surveillance-sharing” agreement with U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase to its updated application. Competitors including Ark Invest, Fidelity Investments and others are also filing similar amendments to their respective Bitcoin ETF applications.\n\nOn July 14, the day after the BlackRock decision, the SEC also added the Bitcoin ETF applications of WisdomTree, VanEck, Fidelity and Invesco Galaxy to its docket.\n\nBlackRock is the world’s largest asset manager with over US$9.4 trillion in assets. The firm filed for its first spot Bitcoin ETF on June 15, fueling optimism for further institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies.\n\nA Bitcoin ETF allows customers to invest in Bitcoin without directly holding the token, and can be traded on traditional stock markets. The U.S. SEC approved the nation’s first Bitcoin futures ETF on June 23, but is so far yet to give the green light to a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nElsewhere, Europe’s first spot Bitcoin ETF — proposed by Jacobi Asset Management — is expected to be publicly listed this month. That follows a 12-month delay from the initially planned date, according to reporting by the Financial Times.\n\nSee related article: US SEC says Bitcoin ETF applications inadequate: WSJ'}, {'id': 1, 'time': 'Mon, 17 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Standard Chartered Ups 2024 Bitcoin Price Prediction To $120000 - Nasdaq', 'content': 'By Landon Manning\n\nStandard Chartered, one of the largest banks in the United Kingdom, has made ripples in the financial world by predicting that the bitcoin price could reach $50,000 by the end of the year, and $120,000 by the end of 2024.\n\nStandard Chartered serves a multinational base of individual and corporate clients from its headquarters in London and although it does not conduct retail banking in the U.K., its multibillion dollar operations in Asia, Africa and the Middle East make it one of the most influential financial firms in the world.\n\nAnd this prominent role in the global financial system is what makes it particularly interesting that Standard Chartered made such a bullish prediction for bitcoin earlier this month. Citing recent market activity and subsequent impacts on miners, a report published by the bank suggested that bitcoin is now set for a meteoric rise, bringing its price up to $120,000 by the end of next year.\n\nStandard Chartered’s optimistic outlook is being bolstered by Bitcoin’s hash rate, the amount of computing power being applied to secure the network by miners and an indicator of the network’s strength, which recently hit an all-time high. This latest prediction upped the bank’s previous call that the bitcoin price would reach $100,000 in 2024, an increase motivated by a more optimistic outlook for miner profitability.\n\n“Increased miner profitability per BTC (bitcoin) mined means they can sell less while maintaining cash inflows, reducing net BTC supply and pushing BTC prices higher,” explained Standard Chartered FX analyst Geoff Kendrick.\n\nThe bitcoin price has already risen in value by some 80% since the beginning of 2023. If it jumps up to $50,000 as expected by the bank, Kendrick added that “Over a year, that would reduce miner selling from 328,500 to a range of 65,700 to 98,550 — a reduction in net BTC supply of roughly 250,000 bitcoins a year.”\n\nThe mining ecosystem is not the only reason to be bullish on bitcoin, however. The strong possibility of an approved spot Bitcoin ETF on the horizon could usher in a new wave of institutional investors.\n\nIt might seem overly optimistic to claim that bitcoin’s price will end up quadrupling over the next year and a half, even with its historic volatility. But there are clear reasons why such a large bank has such confidence in Bitcoin. Hard data shows that the mining industry is thawing from “crypto winter” to become stronger than ever, regulatory approval years in the making appears imminent and BTC has once again emerged from a cycle low with strong momentum.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.'}, {'id': 13, 'time': 'Mon, 17 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Bitcoin Halving Amongst Major Events to Watch in the Crypto Market - Yahoo Finance', 'content': 'DUBAI, UAE / ACCESSWIRE / July 18, 2023 / Unlike the halving of Litecoin, which had no substantial effect on its price in the past, the halving of Bitcoin is currently one of the major expected events in the crypto market. Bitcoin is set to undergo a periodic halving in 2024.* BITmarkets has identified bitcoin halving as one of the major events for the crypto trading community. The trader\'s perspective on the phenomenon of halving is a part of 2023 Mid-Year Crypto Outlook.\n\nBITmarkets, Tuesday, July 18, 2023, Press release picture\n\n"After the challenges of 2022, the current year seems to have blown a wind of change indeed. The possibility of cryptocurrencies aiming back towards the highs of 2021 during the upcoming year can be realistic, given revitalizing market conditions. Of course, there are risks, or in other words, obstacles along the way, but current market conditions may indicate a rather prosperous development and outcome for cryptocurrencies in the near future," says Peter Sumer, COO of BITmarkets, on the findings of the Outlook study.\n\n2023 has started strong for cryptocurrencies and other financial market assets, combatting headwinds with fierce force and retaining hard-earned value. Among the trends of the current year and the ones to follow are several: more regulation, rise of central bank digital currencies, popularization of DeFi, more investments into stablecoins and the revitalization or deterioration of NFTs.\n\nIdentity verification strictness may increase as more cyberattacks and hacks have been detected in recent times. Increased regulation is intended to safeguard the funds and data of crypto traders. This can come in the form of increasing scrutiny of identity verification, which can bolster the effectiveness of regulatory frameworks set in place.\n\nOther legal measures such as passing new laws that tackle money laundering and necessitating accurate & recurrent corporate reporting can achieve higher consumer protection.\n\nMore information on trends and upcoming events in the world of crypto traders is to be found in the 2023 Mid-Year Crypto Outlook: Crypto Trends to Watch & 2024 Bitcoin Halving, a study by BITmarkets.\n\nStory continues\n\nBITmarkets is a crypto exchange that operates in more than 15 languages and offers 24/7 support in local languages.

The initial block reward for BTC was 50 BTC, while the current block reward stands at 6.25 BTC, and the next block reward will be 3.125 BTC, and the halving continues.

The cryptocurrency market is currently experiencing a mix of positive and negative factors.

The native cryptocurrency of Zilliqa is crucial in securing the network, executing smart contracts, and incentivizing participants.\n\nAlso, the mainnet network update v9.2 for Zilliqa was released recently. Critically, the Zilliqa network significantly benefited from this update. In particular, by enhancing the compatibility between the Zilliqa smart contract language, Scilla, and the Ethereum Virtual Machine.\n\nCurrently, Zilliqa has a value of $0.02007 with a market cap of $318M, a drop of 2.14% overnight.\n\nChainlink (LINK): Focus on Smart Contracts\n\nChainlink (LINK) connects smart contracts with real-world data and external APIs. Smart contracts on blockchain networks often lack access to real-time information, and Chainlink (LINK) solves this problem by securely providing external data feeds. The native cryptocurrency of Chainlink incentivizes node operators and secures the network.\n\nCurrently, Chainlink is trading hands at $6.12 with a market cap of $3.2B, down 1.49% in the past day alone. However, the trading volume of Chainlink has increased by 22.46% in that same time and now sits at $116,310,694.\n\nWith the increasing adoption of smart contracts and the demand for reliable and accurate external data, Chainlink has gained significant attention from developers and enterprises. Its unique value proposition and growing ecosystem make it a compelling alternative to Bitcoin.\n\nTradecurve (TCRV): Innovative Trading Platform\n\nTradecurve (TCRV) is a comprehensive platform integrating derivatives and cryptocurrency trading. With its privacy-focused approach and innovative features, including a metaverse trading academy, negative balance protection, and level-up bonuses, Tradecurve will benefit both beginner and experienced traders.\n\nAdditionally, this borderless trading platform incorporates the best components of centralized and decentralized exchanges, so expect to see low latency, slippage-free trading, fast order execution, and more.\n\nOn Tradecurve, all users can trade all derivatives on a single account that can be created quickly, as no sign-up KYC checks will be necessary. Over 15,000 users have registered for Tradecurve so far, showcasing their faith in its long-term growth potential.\n\nThe native token of Tradecurve adds utility to the platform, providing benefits such as reduced fees and access to exclusive features. Currently, it is available for just $0.018 - an 80% surge from its starting price. With over $2.8M raised so far, Tradecurve may even overtake the likes of Huobi.\n\nAs more traders seek enhanced trading experiences and diversified investment opportunities, Tradecurve (TCRV) stands out as a promising alternative to Bitcoin - so sign up for its presale below.\n\nFor more information about the Tradecurve presale:\n\nClick Here For Website\n\nFollow Us Twitter\n\nJoin Our Community on Telegram\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nThis is an advertorial.

Armstrong and other Coinbase executives have said they will fight the SEC allegations in court.\n\nThe SEC on July 13 received a setback in another lawsuit, filed more than two years ago, against Ripple Labs, when a U.S. district court ruled that Ripple Labs’ programmatic sales of its XRP cryptocurrency did not qualify as offerings of financial securities.\n\nThe Ripple ruling is a “potential watershed” for the broader crypto market, wrote Robert Quartly-Janeiro, the chief strategy officer of Singapore-based crypto exchange Bitrue, in an email statement shared with Forkast Tuesday.\n\nXRP was the only top 10 cryptocurrency to gain on Wednesday morning, adding 3.89% to US$0.7678, further extending its weekly surge of 61.26%.\n\nLosses were led by Polygon’s Matic and Solana. Polygon dipped 5.81% to US$0.7363, falling 0.36% in the past seven days.\n\nSolana lost 5.24% to US$25.33, but it’s holding gains of 15.01% for the week.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization fell 0.50% in the past 24 hours to US$1.2 trillion, with trading volume dipping 9.49% to US$32.17 billion.\n\nNFT trade sinks toward yearly low\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market.

Forkast NFT market indexes measuring the performance on Ethereum, Polygon and Cardano blockchains all dropped, while the Solana index rose.\n\n“We’re on pace for another yearly low for total global transactions today, and in general, sales are pretty unremarkable across blockchains,” said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News. “The top collections are struggling to even reach $500k in daily secondary sales, which is unusual to see. The index reflects a flat market.”\n\nEthereum-based Azuki NFT collection topped trading volume, rising 3.26% to US$972,691.

Bitcoin on Wednesday was hovering just below the $30,000 level it retook four weeks ago. Still, it struggled to break above that mark earlier in the year and that continues to be the case now. Both bitcoin and ether are flat for the week, down 1% for the month and up about 7% since the rally on June 21 following BlackRock\'s bitcoin exchange-traded fund application. Multiple closing prices for both crypto assets show their short- and intermediate-term price trends are higher and support further upside, Canaccord\'s technical analyst Javed Mirza said in a note Tuesday. He told investors to "utilize pending near-term weakness to add exposure near important technical support at their 50-day moving averages." BTC.CM= 1Y mountain Bitcoin has been stuck at $30,000 but Canaccord Genuity sees 28% upside in the medium term Mirza said bitcoin can run another 28.3% higher from current levels, targeting $38,202, if it continues to close above $26,249 over several weeks. Investors should expect the first level of resistance at about $30,493 on the upside and the next at $31,476, he said. Should the bitcoin price turn lower, first support would be at $28,717, about the level of its 50-day moving average. The next level down would be at about $27,441, a level it has not seen in a month. For ether, he sees another 55.6% upside from current levels, targeting $2,952, if it can maintain a multiweek close of $1,935. Looking at the long term, bitcoin and ether also recently reclaimed their four-year moving averages of about $27,022 and $1,592, respectively. "This confirms the long-term trend is now up, a strong technical positive, and is consistent with a four-year cycle taking hold in cryptocurrencies," Mirza wrote. Bitcoin historically has followed a four-year cycle tied to its halving events — when the reward for mining bitcoin is cut in half, as designed in the Bitcoin code, to reduce the supply of the cryptocurrency. Lately, investors have been drawing similarities between the cryptocurrency\'s recent behavior and its moves in the lead up to the last halving. — CNBC\'s Michael Bloom contributed reporting.'}]

The Toronto Police Service said in a statement on Monday that it had arrested and charged four men on counts of kidnapping for ransom and other charges: Mr. Heywood, Tyler Fast, 37, and Deren Akyeam-Pong, 24, all of Toronto, as well as Rakeem Henry, 24, of London.\n\nMr. Heywood was among dozens who invested with Mr. Pleterski, who was supposed to invest their money in cryptocurrency and foreign exchange positions, according to court documents. But after spending money feeding a lavish lifestyle, buying three Lamborghinis and three McLarens, Mr. Pleterski filed for bankruptcy in August, leaving investors wondering what had happened to their money.'}, {'id': 39, 'time': 'Thu, 20 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'A carpet and flooring company really wants us to write about bitcoin - Financial Times', 'content': 'Print this page\n\nSimply sign up to the Cryptocurrencies myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nSure, OK, why not:\n\nWorthing, 20th July 2023 – Flooring Hut, a forward-thinking online carpet and flooring retailer, announces its decision to include Bitcoin holdings on its balance sheet, embracing the integration of digital assets into its financial reporting. With this strategic move, Flooring Hut demonstrates its commitment to staying at the forefront of technological advancements and adapting to the evolving financial landscape.\n\nFormed in 2015, Flooring Hut stocks a wide range of carpet, laminate and vinyl flooring solutions, and is obviously engineering the kind of publicity stunt that’s catnip for snarky blogs such as ours.\n\nBy diversifying its asset holdings to include Bitcoin, Flooring Hut embraces innovation and positions itself at the forefront of the digital economy.\n\nAccording to Companies House filings, the privately-owned company has four shareholders and two employees.\n\nFlooring Hut recognises the growing interest and demand from stakeholders, including investors, partners, and customers, who value transparency and progressive approaches to financial reporting. Including Bitcoin holdings on the balance sheet ensures that the company remains responsive to the expectations of its diverse stakeholders.\n\nIts 2023 accounts showed a loss of £173,423 and cash reserves of £75,105, which at spot pricing is enough to buy 3.2 bitcoins.\n\nDavid Greaves, CFO at Flooring Hut says: “Our decision to include Bitcoin on our balance sheet exemplifies our commitment to embracing digital transformation and being at the forefront of technological innovation. We recognise the potential of cryptocurrencies and their impact on the future of finance. By including Bitcoin holdings, we not only diversify our assets but also demonstrate our dedication to transparency and meeting the evolving expectations of our stakeholders.”\n\nNews of Flooring Hut’s endorsement of bitcoin follows an announcement on Tuesday that it would be “honouring the legacy of Nelson Mandela” through initiatives that combine “the principles of social responsibility with their expertise in flooring solutions.” On Monday it press-released the donation of a wall clock to K2 Leisure Centre in Crawley, West Sussex. Last week it highlighted the role that innovative flooring solutions play in Bastille Day celebrations.

We think this reflects idiosyncratic positives, including optimism about eventual spot Bitcoin ETF approval, as well as Bitcoin’s surge in March following stress in regional banks,” Grayscale said.\n\n“Valuations are now more closely tied to broader macro trends, and more Fed tightening could be a headwind for higher risk assets, including both equities and cryptocurrencies,” the report said.\n\nBack in Asia Friday morning trading, Ether edged up 0.31% to US$1,895.14, while falling 4.70% in the last week.\n\nOther top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies were mixed — Polygon’s Matic led gainers, rising 3.42% to US$0.7711.

BlackRock joins tens of other smaller ETF providers with the same request, so far without success. But with BlackRock’s heft behind growing demands for a spot Bitcoin fund, it’s only a matter of time before the SEC relents.\n\nAnd it should. A spot ETF would allow investors to buy, sell and hold Bitcoin more easily, cheaply and securely than they can today.

That was the largest financial seizure in DOJ history.\n\nThe bitcoin stolen in the hack was worth just $70 million at the time of the theft, but soared in value in the following years.\n\n"Over the last five years, approximately 25,000 of those stolen bitcoin were transferred out of Lichtenstein\'s wallet via a complicated money laundering process that ended with some of the stolen funds being deposited into financial accounts controlled by Lichtenstein and Morgan," the DOJ said at the time of their arrests.\n\nNetflix in early 2022 announced it had commissioned a series on the couple.'}, {'id': 44, 'time': 'Fri, 21 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Code Green Apparel Corp.

He then called on the WhatsApp number to find out what was wrong, but the person who answered told him to invest another Rs 34,500 to withdraw his profit.

Previewing the price chart shows that the coin has been in range over the years, capturing all of its volatility. Despite occasional dumps and pumps, the structure is yet to be broken.\n\nBy the time the screenshot was shared on July 21, Bitcoin was trading in the lower part of the rising channel, skirting the support trend line, an indicator that prices have been generally lower in recent months. The rejection of lower lows and bounce from the support trend line, the analyst says, is bullish and squarely puts back bulls in contention.\n\nBitcoin To $175,000?\n\nAccording to the trader’s assessment, a breakout above the upper resistance level at around $32,000 could potentially trigger a new bull run that may see the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency retest highs of the rising channel at $175,000, a level that upbeat HODLers can mark as a feasible target.\n\nStill, considering the volatility in crypto, this bullish forecast cannot be dismissed. To illustrate, the last bull run drove Bitcoin prices from sub-$10,000 to peaks of $69,000 in less than two years. Therefore, if Bitcoin bulls push above $32,000, a price level that the analyst claim is important, it could be a bullish signal that may be the beginning of another leg up in the resumption of the bullish formation set in motion between 2020 and 2021.\n\nBitcoin is trading below the $30,000 level at spot rates with resistance at $31,800. Despite the general optimism across the board, bulls are yet to breach July 2023 highs as prices consolidate.\n\nHalving And ETF Approval As Tailwinds?\n\nSpecific triggers for the next run are unknown for now. Even so, considering past cycles, the upcoming Bitcoin halving event may provide the impetus for a leg up toward 2021 highs at $69,000. Besides, traders are closely monitoring how the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications in the United States progresses.\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has rejected several spot Bitcoin ETF applications in the past. However, the involvement of BlackRock has been received positively, lifting prices in the past few weeks.

Amidst these market movements, a crucial event known as Bitcoin Halving has taken place three times. But what exactly is Bitcoin Halving and what role does it play in the Bitcoin ecosystem?\n\nWhat is Bitcoin Halving?\n\n\n\nBitcoin Halving is a special event that happens about every four years in the Bitcoin system. There will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins in total. Right now, around 19.5 million Bitcoins have been mined so far, of which 4 million has been irreversibly lost. 1.5 million BTC are yet to be mined. During the halving event, the rewards that Bitcoin miners get for their work are cut in half. This event has had an effect on the price of Bitcoin in the past. The next halving is scheduled to take place on 26th April 2024.\n\n\n\nHow does Bitcoin Halving Work?\n\n\n\nIn simple terms, Bitcoin validators are responsible for checking and approving Bitcoin transactions through a process called mining. When they successfully validate a block of transactions, they currently receive a reward of 6.25 BTC (Bitcoins), which is currently worth around $148,000. This acts as a good incentive for miners to continue validating and adding blocks of transactions to the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\n\n\nThese blocks of transactions are added approximately every 10 minutes, and the Bitcoin system has a rule that reduces the mining reward by half after every 210,000 blocks are created. This reduction happens roughly every four years and is often accompanied by increased price changes and unpredictability in the value of Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nAfter the fourth halving event, which is scheduled to happen next year, the mining rewards will decrease to 3.125 BTC per block.\n\n\n\nHistory of Bitcoin Halving and Price\n\n\n\nLooking back at the past, we can see that during previous halving events, the price of Bitcoin increases in anticipation and then after the event it stabilizes. In 2012, the price was $9 on October 26th and rose to $12.35 on the day of the halving on 28th Nov 2012.\n\nSimilarly, in 2016 the price of Bitcoin was $568 on June 28th and on the date of halving on July 9th, the price was $650.53. In 2020, on April 11th the bitcoin price was about $5884 and on the date of halving on 2020 11th May, the price was $8553. These historical patterns show that Bitcoin Halving has often led to a substantial increase in price before and in the following months. This demonstrates the potential impact that the halving event can have on the value of Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nWhy is Bitcoin Halving Important?\n\n\n\nThe reason for reducing the mining reward through Bitcoin Halving is to manage the creation of new Bitcoins and maintain their limited availability in the long run. By lowering the reward, Bitcoin Halving helps control inflation and ensures that the production of new Bitcoins happens at a slower pace. This event has important effects on the supply and potential value of Bitcoin, as well as on the miners who play a vital role in securing the network using their computers. Understanding Bitcoin Halving is crucial for grasping how the Bitcoin market works and the factors that impact its value over time.\n\nHow can Bitcoin Halving Impact the Miners?\n\nThe upcoming Bitcoin halving event will reduce the mining rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block next year. This reduction in rewards may make mining less profitable for miners. Consequently, unless there is a significant increase in the price of Bitcoin, miners are likely to pause their investments in new mining hardware for the next few months. In some cases, miners may even shut down less efficient mining hardware because it fails to generate sufficient bitcoins to cover operational expenses.\n\n\n\nIn the short term, the decrease in mining resources is expected to result in a slower rate of Bitcoin creation. However, the Bitcoin network has an automatic mechanism to maintain a relatively constant rate of new bitcoin production. Every two weeks, the network adjusts the difficulty of the mining problem to ensure an average rate of approximately six blocks per hour. If blocks are being produced too slowly, the network lowers the difficulty level to widen the range of winning hash values. Conversely, if blocks are being created too quickly, the network increases the difficulty to make the mining problem more challenging and slow down block creation.\n\n\n\nMiners strive to make profits, and competition among miners helps maintain relatively stable profit margins over time. Therefore, if revenues from Bitcoin mining decrease by half, miners will likely spend approximately half the amount to produce those bitcoins. Since electricity is a major cost in Bitcoin mining, the reduction in block rewards should ultimately lead to a similar reduction in the electricity consumed by mining.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the halving event indirectly affects mining difficulty. As block rewards decrease, miner...'}]

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin miners are creating a virtuous circle that could propel the token\'s price beyond already-bullish forecasts, Standard Chartered analyst Geoff Kendrick told Insider.\n\nThat\'s as miners often sell fewer tokens when the price climbs, a bullish tendency that led him say earlier this month that $120,000 is possible next year, representing 300% upside from current levels.\n\nIn a follow-up interview, Insider asked Kendrick: if higher prices cause miners to sell fewer tokens, further boosting prices, then would even higher prices fuel a positive-feedback loop that takes bitcoin past $120,000?\n\nYes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n"And so your point about this becoming self-fulfilling, I suspect is actually a very important driver," he said.\n\nMiners predominantly sell bitcoin to cover costs. But as the price rises and previous debt struggles in the industry ebb away, miners are letting go of less bitcoin.\n\nAnother tailwind is the coin\'s upcoming halving in 2024, which is when the reward given to miners is cut in half. This is to cap the supply of bitcoins, and has historically led to price increases.\n\n"Then if you add in some of the other things, like getting close to the halving cycle, et cetera, then that sort of adds," Kendrick said. "And then yeah, the cycle in theory just keeps going."\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMiners also have little reason outside of bitcoin\'s price moves to sell the token, he said. Some of this is on account of the culture surrounding the industry, with many miners holding on in the anticipation that bitcoin eventually reaches stellar highs.\n\n"So they basically want to have a company that starts out when prices are cheap, get cheaper electricity and stuff, and then hold on. It\'s like a super-leveraged play," he said.\n\nKendrick has been bullish on bitcoin this year, and in April he said it would hit $100,000 in 2024, citing a number of other factors beyond miner profitability.

The news sparked a rally in altcoins.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n"So the assumption is, well, if Ripple is not [a security], then these are also not," he said.

Let’s study the charts of top-five cryptocurrencies that could turn positive over the next few days.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin remains pinned below the 20-day exponential moving average ($30,036) for the past few days, but a positive sign is that the bears have not been able to sink the price to the 50-day simple moving average ($28,979).\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThis suggests that the bulls have not given up and they are buying on every minor dip. The repeated failure of the bears to pull the BTC/USDT pair lower may attract buyers.\n\nIf the price breaks above the 20-day EMA, the pair could rally toward the overhead resistance of $31,000. A charge above the $31,000-to-$32,400 zone could clear the path for a possible rally to $40,000.\n\nOn the other hand, if the price turns down and dives below the 50-day SMA, it will suggest that bears are making a comeback. The pair may then slump toward the support at $24,800.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe moving averages on the four-hour chart are flattening out and the relative strength index (RSI) has risen to the midpoint, indicating that the range-bound action may continue for some more time.\n\nIf bulls push the price above the 50-day SMA, the pair could attempt a rally to $30,500 and then to $31,000. The important support to watch on the downside is $29,500. If this level crumbles, the pair may decline to $27,500.\n\nChainlink price analysis\n\nChainlink (LINK) has been trading inside a large range between $5.50 and $9.50 for the past several months. The bears pulled the price below the range on June 10, but they could not build upon this advantage.\n\nLINK/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bulls pushed the price back into the range on June 21 and are currently attempting to drive the LINK/USDT pair toward the overhead resistance of $9.50. Both moving averages have turned up and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating that bulls are in control.\n\nThe bears will try to stall the up-move in the zone between $8.50 and $8.80, but if buyers bulldoze their way through, the pair may soar to $9.50. The important support to watch on the downside is $7.50 and then the 20-day EMA ($7.05).\n\nLINK/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe correction on the four-hour chart has reached the 20-day EMA, which is an important level to watch out for. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, the pair could surge to $8.46. A break above this level will indicate the resumption of the uptrend. The pair could then reach $8.80.\n\nThis positive view will be negated in the near term if the price turns down and plummets below the 20-day EMA. That could tempt short-term bulls to book profits, pulling the price down to the 50-day SMA and, subsequently, to $6.50.\n\nFilecoin price analysis\n\nFilecoin (FIL) is trying to form an inverse head and shoulders pattern, which will complete on a break and close above the neckline.\n\nFIL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-day EMA ($4.36) has started to turn up gradually and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating that the path of least resistance is to the upside. If buyers thrust the price above the neckline, the FIL/USDT pair could attempt a rally to $6.50 and, eventually, to the pattern target of $7.30.\n\nOn the contrary, if the price turns down sharply from the neckline and breaks below the 50-day SMA ($4.12), it will suggest that the bulls have lost their grip. The pair may then skid to $3.50 and later to $3.29.\n\nFIL/USDT four-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-day EMA is sloping up on the four-hour chart and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating that bulls have the upper hand. There is a minor resistance at $4.74, but if this level is crossed, the pair could retest the neckline.\n\nThe bears are expected to defend this level aggressively, but if bulls do not allow the price to slip below the 20-day EMA, the likelihood of a rally above the neckline increases.\n\nAlte...'}]

Specifically, CEO Changpeng "CZ" Zhao reportedly suggested in private conversation in 2019 that Binance affiliates had accounted for a portion of trading volume around the time it launched its U.S. trading arm. There are questions about whether this activity constituted "wash trading" aimed at inflating volume.\n\nBitcoin was last lower by more than 3% at $29,121.60, according to Coin Metrics. Earlier, it sank as low as $28,995.02, its lowest level in more than a month.\n\nThe price of bitcoin fell sharply and suddenly to start the week as investors awaited a major Federal Reserve policy decision and digested concerns around Binance.\n\nBinance is the largest crypto exchange in the world. It was sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission last month and is at the center of a Department of Justice investigation that\'s likely to end with a consent decree or settlement, CNBC previously reported. Federal prosecutors have been weighing anti-money laundering violations and sanctions evasion charges, allegations that would make it difficult for Binance or founder Zhao to continue to get licenses to operate.\n\nNot everyone is convinced the big move could be put on the Binance story, however.\n\n"You could probably chalk it up to technicals or flows," said Callie Cox, analyst at investing firm eToro. "$30,000 is a big deal, and it makes sense that bitcoin investors are feeling more nervous around these levels. Recoveries aren\'t always a straight line up."\n\nElsewhere, investors are also watching what the Federal Reserve does at the conclusion of its two-day meeting on Wednesday.\n\n"Bitcoin is still fluctuating within a narrow range for a little more than a week, and it will likely continue to do so until the conclusion of this week\'s FOMC meeting," said Yuya Hasegawa, crypto market analyst at Japanese bitcoin exchange Bitbank. "The market has almost fully priced in another 25 basis point rate hike by the Fed this week and is paying close attention to whether they are going to carry out another by the end of this year as FOMC\'s previous economic outlook suggested."\n\nRate increases helped pull bitcoin\'s price lower throughout 2022, which was already filled with several negative catalysts for the industry. Despite the recent resilience in bitcoin and rally in equities, recession concerns remain as traders weigh the lagged effect of rate hikes and recent signals of slowing in the economy.\n\n"We have yet to see June\'s personal consumption expenditure … and they will not likely hasten to make the decision to halt rate hikes until they have more data and are more confident that inflation is coming down," Hasegawa added. "This means that FOMC\'s rate decisions henceforth will likely continue to be \'live,\' and bitcoin may not successfully break out of $31,500 for another while."\n\n—CNBC\'s Rohan Goswami contributed reporting.'}]

If you want to see more of his predictions, check out 5 Nouriel Roubini Predictions.\n\nHe sounded like a madman when he stood at a packed International Monetary Fund conference in 2006 and predicted a global economic recession. But he was a prophet when he returned to the same conference in 2007. Welcome to the world of Nouriel Roubini, a renowned economist born in Istanbul to a Jewish family that has been the center of many economic events that have shaped the world over the past 20 years.\n\nRoubini studied economics in Italy against his parents' expectations, as they expected him to continue the family legacy in the rug dealing business. As the black sheep of the family, he would go against the grain, going on to obtain a Ph.D. in international economics at Harvard University. A stint at Yale University as an economist lecturer would pave the way for him to take up a teaching position at New York University, bringing him to the global capital of all financial matters.\n\nIn a field with dozens of people giving analysis and predictions, Roubini has always stood out owing to his unusual approach to analyzing and predicting the economy. His model is not like any other, as it relies on intuition to predict what is likely to happen. Amid the successes in predicting how the global economy is expected to fare, he has also attracted criticism owing to his relentless prediction of disasters.\n\nHe is often referred to as Wall Street's Doom economist owing to his track record in predicting some of the biggest catastrophes that have engulfed the global economy. He first shone to light in 2006 as he accurately predicted the collapse of the U.S. market that would eventually trigger one of the biggest and most consequential financial crises.\n\nIn 2019, at the height of Donald Trump's presidency, he predicted that an escalating US-China trade war would escalate into a cold war and a currency war. Nothing could be further from the truth as the two countries are entangled in a vicious supremacy war around emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, critical minerals, and semiconductors. Likewise, China is spearheading the creation of a new currency to counter the dollar's edge as a global reserve currency.\n\nStory continues\n\nRoubini is also on record predicting that the COVID-19 pandemic would trigger greater depression than the 1930s depression. The pandemic ended up triggering significant supply chain pressures leading to a four-decade high inflation rate in several countries. While the U.S. economy has recovered, the prospect of another recession on the horizon is high.\n\nNouriel Roubini on Bitcoin and Other Predictions\n\nSource: pixabay\n\nAt the height of the pandemic, the U.S. Federal Reserve embarked on an interest rate cut frenzy to stimulate the economy. Cutting interest rates to near zero triggered heightened inflation as growth stagnated. As inflation levels rose to 30-year highs, Roubini warned that the FED would struggle to do what it needs to try to lower inflation levels without triggering a recession. That was the case as inflation rose to about 9.2% representing 40-year highs.\n\nWhile the FED did embark on an aggressive monetary policy tightening to try and bring inflation below the recommended 2% levels, Roubini has warned that the economy could be heeded to a deep recession.

Roubini believes the economy is headed toward a deep recession with those thinking of a mild recession are delusional.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nRoubini's accurate foresight of major economic events has cemented his position as one of the world's most prominent and reliable economists. In this article, we will explore Roubini's predictions over the years and what he believes the future will be all about amid the cryptocurrency revolution. This list reviewed Roubini’s major predictions and their impact on the global economy. We ranked them chronologically from when the predictions were made. Let's delve into some of his most notable predictions and their impact on the global financial landscape.\n\n10. The Financial Crisis: 2007-2009\n\nThe 2008 financial crisis is arguably one of the biggest economic events that propelled Roubini to prominence. Two years before the global economy plunged into recession, the economist had warned of a potential housing bubble, excessive leverage, and risky financial practices. While at first, he seemed like a prophet of doom, his predictions materialized, affirming his status as one of the ears worth listening to on economic matters.\n\nAs early as 2005, the economist had warned that the housing market was in a bubble due to the low-interest rate environment and lax lending standards fueled by speculative demand.

The cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, is currently experiencing a period of volatility and caution as investors await the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision. Bitcoin has slipped below $29,200, with Ethereum hovering just above $1,850. The market sentiment is cautious due to concerns about the Ripple case, speculation on Bitcoin investment funds, and negative headlines about Binance. Additionally, the launch of the NanoPOD by Digital Shovel aims to provide smaller miners with a more accessible and sophisticated solution for their operations. Overall, the market trend appears uncertain with a potential for further declines in the short term, especially if the Federal Reserve raises interest rates, but a possible rally could occur once the market adjusts to the rate hike.

It’s becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish fiction from reality, which is a particular concern in the financial and democratic systems. Worldcoin wants to defend people from AI misinformation and make it clear who and what to trust online,” added Schoeman.\n\nIn emailed comments on Worldcoin, Michael Silberberg, head of investor relations at the U.S.-based crypto hedge fund AltTab Capital, said: “The value of a real non-transferable, and cryptographically secure identity is potent as it could reduce digital fraud, help bank the unbanked, and even reduce the number of times I have to convince robots I’m not a robot a day.”\n\nAccording to reports, the Worldcoin project signed up more than two million users during beta testing and is now expanding operations to 35 cities across 20 countries, but the US isn’t yet one of them, said Schoeman.\n\n“Altman made it clear the company didn’t feel the US would make or break the project, but with North America said to account for around 18% of the total world crypto value received, breaking into the US market will be a major concern for Worldcoin,” he said.\n\n“A global digital ID enabling private identity verifications is undeniably revolutionary, however, it’s certain to stir up controversy, with many already calling the exchange of biometric data for crypto tokens an outlandish bribe,” said Schoeman.\n\nForkast 500 flat, Sotheby’s NFT auction sells out\n\nThe ind...'}]

Slated to commence operations on September 15th, the facility takes advantage of Paraguay\'s low electricity prices, offering hosting at an competitive rate of 4.7 cents per kWh – a far cry from the average cost of 16.1 cents per kWh in the United States.\n\n"By harnessing surplus electricity, Bitcoin mining has ingeniously transformed Paraguay\'s previous losses into a profitable venture for the entire nation," stated Kent Halliburton, President and COO of Sazmining. "Embracing this development, Paraguayan politicians and the local power provider, ANDE, are actively participating in electricity-for-Bitcoin transactions. Beyond immediate financial gains, Sazmining has a larger vision focused on creating a sustainable and forward-looking future by investing in electrical infrastructure that will benefit Paraguay for generations to come, extending well beyond the lifespan of any Bitcoin mining activities."\n\nAs a fully non-custodial service, Sazmining ensures customers\' Bitcoin rewards are directly sent from the mining pool to their private wallets. Operating on a mutually beneficial model, Sazmining only earns when the customer does, incentivizing them to optimize the mining environment for maximum efficiency and the longevity of the miners.\n\nThe facility will provide customers with their signature white-glove, on-site maintenance, customer-service experiences, and a dedicated security team to ensure the highest standards of safety and performance.\n\nIn 1971, Brazil and Paraguay joined forces to construct the Itaipu Dam, generating 14 gigawatts of electricity. Under the agreement, Brazil financed the project, and in return, Paraguay received surplus electricity beyond its domestic needs. Initially faced with the challenge of handling this surplus, Paraguay started selling the excess power to Brazil, albeit at a financial loss. However, the advent of the Bitcoin mining industry has now presented a perfect solution to this situation, allowing Paraguay to not only profit from their surplus energy but also house advanced Bitcoin mining facilities.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.'}, {'id': 48, 'time': 'Thu, 27 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Crypto Price Today: Bitcoin rises above $29,400 post FOMC outcome; Solana, Cardano jump up to 7% - The Economic Times', 'content': '\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cryptocurrency markets were majorly trading higher on Thursday after the US Federal Reserve stuck to script with a 25 basis-point rate hike.The Fed as anticipated lifted its benchmark lending rate to a range between 5.25% and 5.5%, with Chair Jerome Powell saying during a press conference that the central bank would let data determine whether to hike again.Bitcoin (BTC) surged 0.67% to $29,429, whereas Ethereum (ETH) was above the 1,850 level.

Bitcoin, which had previously dipped to a low of US$29,097 on Tuesday, has now shown signs of recovery, surpassing the US$29,400 level," Edul Patel, Co-founder and CEO at Mudrex, said."However, to fend off aggressive bearish sentiments, the bulls must assert their dominance and sustain the price above the US$31,000 threshold," Edul added.Other top crypto tokens, XRP BNB , Cardano and Solana were also trading higher on Thursday.

The Fed’s aggressive interest rate hikes to battle multi-decade-high inflation saw the cryptocurrency market taking a hit last year. This year has been good as favorable macroeconomic conditions have helped cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), make a solid rebound.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin price fell below $29,500 on Jul 26 after the Fed increased interest rates by 25 basis points. Earlier this year, Bitcoin soared to a 13-month high of $31,500 driven by robust demand from institutional buyers.\n\nThe scenario is exactly opposite to that of last year. The Fed has increased interest rates by 525 basis points since March 2021, which raised doubts about the potential of Bitcoin.\n\nBesides, a series of unfortunate events like the Terra Luna crash and a major fraud that resulted in FTX’s bankruptcy raised concerns about the future of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe flash crash on Wednesday was expected as market participants were almost certain about the Fed’s rate hike. Growth assets like technology stocks, consumer discretionary stocks and cryptocurrencies are adversely affected by higher interest rates. So, this may not entirely come as a shock.\n\nBitcoin’s price has surged 78.1% year to date and hovered around the $30,000 mark almost through July. Economists had forecast that Bitcoin would bounce back in 2023 and gather further momentum in the second half.\n\nThis is because macroeconomic conditions are a lot more favorable now. Economic data indicates that inflation has started cooling.

Some argue that the recent United States Federal Reserve interest rate increase to 5.25% had a detrimental effect on risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies. However, Bitcoin bulls believe that the full impact of a tighter economic policy takes time to influence the markets.\n\nBitcoin daily price movements during option expiries. Source: TradingView\n\nLooking back, the monthly expiry on June 30 did not cause significant volatility, given that Bitcoin had already experienced a 22.2% gain between June 15 and June 23. Conversely, the May monthly expiry triggered a 9% rally, with Bitcoin’s price rising from $26,100 on May 25 to $28,450 on May 29.\n\nIn contrast, the options expiry in April resulted in a 7% correction, as Bitcoin’s price dropped from $29,900 on April 27 to $27,800 on May 1. This data clearly indicates that the impact of options expiry takes a few days to consolidate but eventually becomes highly relevant for setting trends.\n\nBulls have regulatory and the ETF momentum on their side\n\nThere are multiple spot Bitcoin ETF requests from some of the world’s largest fund managers, including BlackRock and Fidelity. In addition, on July 26, a U.S. House committee approved a pair of bills aiming to clarify the distinctions between securities instruments and digital commodities.\n\nThe recent positive corporate earnings also support the bullish momentum in risk-on markets. Along with the latest Consumer Confidence data, they strengthen the argument that the risk of a recession is diminishing, at least in the short term. For starters, Meta Platforms reported $32 billion in 2Q revenues, surpassing the market’s estimates.\n\nSeveral other companies have also reported earnings above consensus, including McDonald’s, Coca-Cola, Google, Johnson & Johnson, Morgan Stanley and Novartis. As for the U.S. Consumer Confidence Index, the metric reached its highest level in two years, reaching 117 in July, up from 110.1 in June.\n\nData shows bulls were excessively optimistic on Bitcoin price\n\nThe open interest for the options expiry on July 28 is $2 billion. Still, the actual figure is expected to be lower because some bullish traders anticipated price levels of $31,000 or higher. This excessive optimism stemmed from Bitcoin trading above the resistance level from July 13 to July 24.\n\nBitcoin options aggregate open interest for July 28. Source: Deribit\n\nThe 0.56 put-to-call ratio reflects the imbalance between the $1.3 billion in call (buy) open interest and the $740 million in put (sell) options. Yet, if Bitcoin’s price remains near $29,500 at 8:00 am UTC on July 28, only $137 million worth of these call (buy) options will be available. This difference happens because the right to buy Bitcoin at $30,000 or $31,000 is useless if BTC trades below that level on expiry.\n\nBitcoin bears aim for sub-$29,000 to secure some profit\n\nBelow are the four most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of options contracts available on July 28 for call (buy) and put (sell) instruments varies depending on the expiry price. The imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit.\n\nThis crude estimate disregards more complex investment strategies. For instance, a trader could have sold a put option, effectively gaining positive exposure to Bitcoin above a specific price. Unfortunately, there’s no easy way to estimate this effect.\n\nBetween $27,000 and $28,000: 1,100 calls vs. 10,000 puts. The net result favors the put instruments by $240 million.\n\n1,100 calls vs. 10,000 puts. The net result favors the put instruments by $240 million. Between $28,000 and $29,000: 3,000 calls vs. 6,800 puts. The net result favors the put instruments by $110 million.\n\n3,000 calls vs. 6,800 puts. The net result favors the put instruments by $110 million. Between $29,000 and $31,000: 6,500 calls vs. 6,600 puts. The result is balanced between put and call options.\n\n6,500 calls vs. 6,600 puts. The result is balanced between put and call options. Between $31,000 and $32,000: 15,400 calls vs. 3,800 puts. The net result favors the call instruments by $360 million.\n\nNote that the bulls’ best shot requires a 5.5% price increase ahead of the July 28 expiry to secure a profit. On the other hand, bears only need a modest 2% correction below $29,000 to come out ahead on the monthly expiry. However, the potential profit of $110 million doesn’t justify a large effort for the bears. Moreover, given that Bitcoin has recently failed to break the $29,000 support level, the most probable outcome for the expiry is a neutral area near $30,000.\n\nWhen analyzing a broader mid-to-long-term scenario, Bitcoin bears may have the upper hand due to the added incentives of higher fixed-income returns resulting from the reduced 3% inflation and increased interest rates.

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
The news articles suggest that Bitcoin is currently trading below $29,200, with the market experiencing a slight decline. Despite the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate hike and concerns about prolonged high rates impacting the market's future price action, Bitcoin has shown resilience and remains within a narrow range. Options traders are eyeing $31,000 as a potential support level, with bullish momentum supported by regulatory developments and positive corporate earnings. However, excessive optimism among traders and the potential for bears to secure profit below $29,000 indicate a neutral market outlook near $30,000. Overall, the market trend for Bitcoin appears to be uncertain with a potential for consolidation in the near term.

Here's what to expect in August. - CNBC", 'content': 'Chalk it up to the summer doldrums, perhaps, but for weeks nothing has been able to make the bitcoin price budge and investors may be in for more of the same in August. There\'s plenty to look forward to on the other side of the break, however. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap is on pace to finish July down about 3.5%, according to Coin Metrics, after surging 12% in June. In the latest week, bitcoin closed lower by 1.9%. That was its fifth straight weekly decline and worst week since June 9. Coin Metrics measures a week in crypto, which trades 24 hours a day, from the 4:00 p.m. ET stock market close one Friday to the next. The third quarter that ends Sept. 30 is also, historically, the weakest for bitcoin. The average third-quarter gain going back to 2014 is just 4.67%, according to CoinGecko, and it\'s posted a positive third quarter in only four of the nine quarters since bitcoin\'s inception. "August is a quiet month for traditional market investors and crypto is no different," said Greg Cipolaro, global head of research at NYDIG, the crypto subsidiary of Stone Ridge Asset Management. "Historically, mean returns have waned as we go into the summer months and that may play out again in August." But even with the latest downdraft, bitcoin is still up about 77% for the year, and investors are upbeat. There\'s a good amount of potential upside for bitcoin thanks to the XRP ruling , legislation advancing in Congress, bitcoin ETF applications and the upcoming bitcoin halving in the spring of 2024. All that suggests bitcoin\'s price in six months "is likely to be materially higher than it is today," according to Ric Edelman, founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals. More immediately, however, "It\'s likely we\'re going to see more treading water over the next several weeks, simply because no news is likely to emerge," Edelman said. "[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chair] Gensler is not likely to change his public stance on crypto, the SEC is not likely to rule on the Bitcoin ETF applications, Congress is not likely to release major legislation. Yet all the signs toward those eventualities remain strong so everyone is in a waiting game and that will likely persist through the rest of the summer." The outlook was bright to start July: In June, BlackRock filed an application to launch a spot bitcoin ETF, injecting new hope into the market. That was shortly after the SEC brought two lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase , which most market participants hoped would help force some regulatory clarity, as well as the long-awaited XRP ruling. Even as trading volumes and liquidity remain stuck, the industry is ending the month on a high note as well, now that Congress after this week has four crypto bills heading to a full House vote for the first time: the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act and the Keep Your Coins Act. Continued interest rate increases by central banks, most recently the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank , are giving investors added reason to add to their bitcoin positions, Edelman said. Bitcoin traded in tandem with tech stocks for nearly all of last year, but its correlation with the Nasdaq broke down this year as it returned to its status as a noncorrelated asset. The Fed this week hiked interest rates a quarter percentage point to their highest level in more than 22 years. Although policymakers indicated at their June meeting that two more rate hikes were to be expected this year, the majority of the market is anticipating the Fed is finished tightening. "As the markets continue to express uncertainty about whether or not there will be a recession or a correction in the stock market, investors are looking for ways they could hedge their diversified portfolios," Edelman said. "Investors are unlikely to find bargains, meaning that there is more argument for significant increases coming than significant decreases," he added. "There\'s not a lot of reason for worry that bitcoin prices might fall 20% or more. That argues for adding to your positions today." —CNBC\'s Gina Francolla contributed reporting.'}]

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
The news articles suggest that Bitcoin is currently experiencing a period of stagnation, with the price remaining relatively unchanged and potentially facing further declines in August. However, there are positive indicators for the future, such as potential regulatory clarity, upcoming events like the bitcoin halving in 2024, and interest rate increases by central banks driving investors to add to their bitcoin positions. Despite the current lack of significant news, the overall sentiment is optimistic for the long-term growth of Bitcoin.

Speaking at Consensus 2023, Ethan Vera, COO at mining services company Luxor Technologies, said that more equipment is entering Russia than any other country in the globe.\n\nAs China's mining industry was outlawed in 2021, Russia's mining market share increased, making it the second- or third-largest in the world.\n\nThere are no restrictions on Russia that entirely forbid participation in the mining industry, despite the fact that international sanctions were put in place as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and ongoing attacks on the nation.\n\nRussian miners have been encouraged to expand their operations by better mining economics, reduced regulatory oversight and taxes compared to the US and other countries, and low energy costs.\n\nDue to these factors, it will be the only nation that can significantly speed up the rise of hashrate, according to a report by mining company Cryptocurrency Mining Group (CMG)."}, {'id': 3, 'time': 'Sun, 30 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'SEC asked Coinbase to halt trading in everything except bitcoin, CEO says - Financial Times', 'content': 'Print this page\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission asked Coinbase to halt trading in all cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin prior to suing the exchange, in a sign of the agency’s intent to assert regulatory authority over a broader slice of the market.\n\nCoinbase chief executive Brian Armstrong told the Financial Times that the SEC made the recommendation before launching legal action against the Nasdaq-listed company last month for failing to register as a broker.\n\nThe SEC’s case identified 13 mostly lightly traded cryptocurrencies on Coinbase’s platform as securities, asserting that by offering them to customers the exchange fell under the regulator’s remit.\n\nBut the prior request for Coinbase to delist every one of the more than 200 tokens it offers — with the exception of flagship token bitcoin — indicates that the SEC, under chair Gary Gensler, has pushed for wider authority over the crypto industry.\n\n“They came back to us, and they said . . . we believe every asset other than bitcoin is a security,” Armstrong said. “And, we said, well how are you coming to that conclusion, because that’s not our interpretation of the law. And they said, we’re not going to explain it to you, you need to delist every asset other than bitcoin.”\n\nIf Coinbase had agreed, that could have set a precedent that would have left the vast majority of the American crypto businesses operating outside the law unless they registered with the commission.\n\n“We really didn’t have a choice at that point, delisting every asset other than bitcoin, which by the way is not what the law says, would have essentially meant the end of the crypto industry in the US,” he said. “It kind of made it an easy choice . . . let’s go to court and find out what the court says.”\n\nAccording to Brian Armstrong, if Coinbase had agreed, the vast majority of the American crypto businesses would risk operating outside the law unless they registered with the SEC © Reuters\n\nOversight of the crypto industry has hitherto been a grey area, with the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission jockeying for control.\n\nThe CFTC sued the largest crypto exchange, Binance, in March of this year, three months before the SEC launched its own legal action against the company.\n\nGensler has previously said he believes most cryptocurrencies with the exception of bitcoin are securities. However, the recommendation to Coinbase signals that the SEC has adopted this interpretation in its attempts to regulate the industry.\n\nEther, the second-largest cryptocurrency, which is fundamental to many industry projects, was absent from the regulator’s case against the exchange. It also did not feature in the list of 12 “crypto asset securities” specified in the SEC’s lawsuit against Binance.\n\nThe SEC said its enforcement division did not make formal requests for “companies to delist crypto assets”.\n\n“In the course of an investigation, the staff may share its own view as to what conduct may raise questions for the commission under the securities laws,” it added.\n\nStocks, bonds and other traditional financial instruments fall under the SEC’s remit, but US authorities remain locked in debate as to whether all — or any — crypto tokens should fall under its purview.\n\nOversight by the SEC would bring far more stringent compliance standards. Crypto exchanges typically also provide custody services, and borrow and lend to customers, a mix of practices that is not possible for SEC-regulated companies.\n\n“There are a bunch of American companies who have built business models on the assumption that these crypto tokens aren’t securities,” said Charley Cooper, former CFTC chief of staff. “If they’re told otherwise, many of them will have to stop operations immediately.”\n\n“It’s very difficult to see how there could be any public offerings or retail trading of tokens without some sort of intervention from Congress,” said Peter Fox, partner at law firm Scoolidge, Peters, Russotti & Fox.\n\nThe SEC declined to comment on the implications for the rest of the industry of a settlement involving Coinbase delisting every token other than bitcoin.'}, {'id': 38, 'time': 'Sun, 30 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'BlackRock, Worldcoin, Ripple: Bitcoin bull Mike Novogratz dishes on crypto - The Economic Times', 'content': '\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Bitcoin roars back after a year of crypto industry scandals and losses, Mike Novogratz says one man in particular gives him reason to stay bullish.“The most important thing that happened this year in Bitcoin is Larry Fink,” Novogratz said, referring to the investment titan who is chief executive officer at BlackRock Inc., the world’s biggest asset manager.BlackRock thrilled the crypto community in June when it applied to launch an exchange-traded fund to track the spot price of Bitcoin — a move that, if approved, could potentially spark a new wave of investment in the cryptocurrency. But it was Fink’s seeming conversion from crypto skeptic to Bitcoin believer — he now considers it an “international asset” — that really has Novogratz excited.“He got ‘orange-pilled,’ as we say. Orange pill is when you take a nonbeliever and you make them a believer in Bitcoin,” Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital Holdings, told David Rubenstein in an interview this week for an upcoming episode of Bloomberg Wealth. “Larry was a nonbeliever. Now he says, ‘Hey, this is going to be a global currency.’ People around the world all trust it.”BlackRock’s ETF push and Fink’s evolving attitude are part of an “adoption cycle” that Novogratz said may help the coin top its all-time high of nearly $69,000 reached in 2021 — especially when it’s accompanied by an eventual Federal Reserve pivot toward cutting rates. This week, Bitcoin hovered between $29,000 and $30,000 after soaring more than 70% year to date.Novogratz, in a wide-ranging conversation at Galaxy’s offices in lower Manhattan, also said a recent ruling in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s case against Ripple Labs represented a “huge victory” for crypto, and touched on topics ranging from Sam Altman’s eyeball-scanning Worldcoin project to Galaxy’s commitment to keeping a presence in New York.One of the most vocal crypto advocates from Wall Street, Novogratz, a former partner at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Fortress Investment Group, first bought Bitcoin when it was trading at about $100. In 2018, he founded Galaxy Digital, which provides financial services such as trading, investment banking and asset management in the crypto industry.Novogratz’s reputation took a hit last year when a crypto project he supported, the Luna token invented by South Korean entrepreneur Do Kwon as part of an experiment in algorithmic stablecoins, blew up, triggering a series of collapses in the industry. The now-infamous tattoo on his arm — a wolf howling at the moon with the word “Luna” — serves as a “good reminder of hubris,” Novogratz said.His advice today, for someone who has $100,000 to invest: “If they were young and had a high risk tolerance, I’d be buying Alibaba stock. I’d be buying silver, gold, Bitcoin and Ethereum. That’d be my portfolio.” Those with lower risk tolerance should put 30% in a portfolio like that and 70% in bonds and perhaps an index fund, he said.Asked if Worldcoin would take off, Novogratz said “you don’t want to bet against Sam Altman right now.” (Altman, co-founder of Worldcoin, is also behind the artificial intelligence sensation ChatGPT.) Worldcoin uses a small device called an “orb” to scan people’s eyeballs in order to generate a a unique digital identity for online use. A token issued by the project more than doubled in value at launch this week, before retreating from those highs. It traded at $2.20 as of 6:30 p.m. on Friday in New York.“I think the price potentially can go a lot higher, because there’s an AI hype cycle,” Novogratz said. “I don’t know if we will all use that as our identity.”This year, a flurry of enforcement actions by the SEC against the biggest crypto firms has rattled many in the industry. Novogratz said the recent court ruling in the SEC’s suit against Ripple — the judge declared that Ripple’s XRP token was a security in some instances but not in others — delivered a victory to the crypto industry because it proves that “the rules are nothing close to clear.”As for Galaxy itself, even as it moves parts of its business offshore, it remains committed to New York. “I don’t see us not being in the US or being in New York,” Novogratz said.To see the full interview with Novogratz, watch Bloomberg Wealth with David Rubenstein on Tuesday Aug. 8 at 9 p.m. NY time on Bloomberg Television.'}]

Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing a bullish trend, with increasing open prices, total value transferred, and overall positive indicators. The macd_signal consistently showing a buy signal further supports this bullish outlook. 

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights some regulatory challenges that could create short-term volatility in the market. However, positive developments such as BlackRock's ETF push for Bitcoin and Ripple's legal victory suggest long-term prospects for Bitcoin and ETH remain positive.

Reflecting on the combination of on-chain analysis, news reports, and strategic risk management, it is evident that a conservative trading approach prioritizing long-term gains over short-term fluctuations is crucial for sustained profitability in the volatile cryptocurrency market.

Therefore, considering the overall bullish trend in the market and the importance of long-term strategies, I would take a trading action with a confidence level of 0.8, indicating a strong belief in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.

Yahoo Finance Crypto Reporter David Hollerith breaks down the report.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n- Well, early this morning we got more color on the clash between the Securities and Exchange Commission and Coinbase before the SEC filed legal action against the major US crypto exchange in June. Here to tell us more, we're joined by our senior reporter David Hollerith. So David, give us some context here.\n\nDAVID HOLLERITH: Yeah, Rochelle. So as you mentioned, the SEC sued Coinbase at the beginning of June for allegedly operating an unregistered Securities Exchange. Now in the SEC's lawsuit, they named 13 different cryptocurrencies, including ADA and Sol, which they identified as crypto security assets.\n\nNow according to this story from the Financial Times from earlier this morning, the Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said that ahead of launching the legal action against the crypto exchange, the SEC had asked Coinbase to delist more than 200 of its crypto tokens. And this essentially is everything but Bitcoin is what Armstrong was highlighting. And that is obviously far different from the 13 or so coins that are named in the lawsuit. And the implication here is pretty clear.\n\nArmstrong has argued in his statement is that if Coinbase had agreed with the SEC and hadn't opposed it and this case hadn't gone to court, it would have essentially set a legal precedent for the crypto industry, which would have stilted it as far as how much it could grow in the US.\n\nSo again, this goes back to the legal murkiness between whether or not a cryptocurrency is a commodity or a security in the US. And there's not a clear law decided. There the SEC believes that most everything, except Bitcoin, in the crypto asset class is a security. And this is obviously now playing out a series of lawsuits in the courts. The most-- I guess the latest stage lawsuit of these we would bring up would be the Ripple case against the SEC.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo it's also interesting that owning Coinbase stock at this point has kind of become like a regulatory bet for investors on the crypto industry having sort of a more positive regulatory outlook in the near future. It's particularly interesting if you look at Coinbase's stock compared to Bitcoin.\n\nSo there's also this ETF situation that's been going on. BlackRock and a number of other asset managers have filed for a Bitcoin ETF, naming Coinbase is a major partner in those offerings. And that, of course, needs to be approved by the SEC. But around the time of the lawsuit and the BlackRock filing, Coinbase's stock has significantly outperformed Bitcoin.\n\nAnd that's interesting because for most of its-- since its inception, for most of its trading history, Coinbase's stock has well underperformed Bitcoin. So we're seeing a huge outperformance over the month of July and we're going to continue to watch that obviously on Thursday when the company reports second quarter earnings. And we'll want to hear more about the regulatory side of things. It is interesting, though, that Coinbase, their financials are important as ever but it does seem like the legal clash right now is really defining how the stock performs."}, {'id': 30, 'time': 'Mon, 31 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Coinbase CEO Says SEC Wanted All Assets Except Bitcoin Delisted: Report - Yahoo Finance', 'content': 'The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reportedly requested Coinbase to stop trading in all cryptocurrencies except Bitcoin (BTC) before suing America’s largest crypto exchange last month, according to a report by the Financial Times citing CEO Brian Armstrong.\n\n“They came back to us, and they said [. . .] we believe every asset other than bitcoin is a security,” said Coinbase CEO. “And, we said, well how are you coming to that conclusion, because that’s not our interpretation of the law. And they said, we’re not going to explain it to you, you need to delist every asset other than Bitcoin.”\n\nA Coinbase spokesperson told Decrypt that the interview "omitted critical context regarding [Coinbase\'s] conversations with the SEC in the US," adding that "per the SEC’s own admission, the views shared in the FT article may have represented the views of some staff at the time, but did not represent those of the Commission more broadly."\n\nThe SEC didn\'t immediately respond to Decrypt’s requests for comment.\n\nIn a June lawsuit, the SEC accused Coinbase of operating illegally because it failed to register as an exchange. The regulator also alleged the exchange’s staking service offered at least 13 crypto assets that should have been registered as securities, including tokens such as Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), and The Sandbox (SAND).\n\nIn a separate move, the SEC also sued Binance in June for offering unregistered securities and allowing U.S. investors to access its global website Binance.com. The Wall Street regulator also alleged that Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao and the crypto exchange misused and commingled customers\' funds.\n\nAccording to Armstrong, had Coinbase agreed to the request, it would have set a precedent and may have led to the regulator cracking down on the majority of American crypto businesses operating under similar conditions.\n\n“We really didn’t have a choice at that point, delisting every asset other than Bitcoin, which by the way is not what the law says, would have essentially meant the end of the crypto industry in the US,” said Armstrong. “It kind of made it an easy choice [. . .] let’s go to court and find out what the court says.”\n\nStory continues\n\nThe regulator reportedly said its enforcement division did not make formal requests for “companies to delist crypto assets.”\n\nThe Coinbase representative added that the crypto exchange is still in discussions with the SEC and believes "that transparent and fair rulemaking and Congressional action, such as bills that we saw gain bipartisan support in the U.S. House of Representatives last week, represent the best path forward for American crypto users and the companies building the cryptoeconomy in the U.S.”\n\nGensler on Bitcoin\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler has previously suggested that all cryptocurrencies aside from Bitcoin are securities.\n\nHe’s also often been citing the lack of investor protection as a reason for enforcement actions against crypto companies, comparing the sector to “the Wild West.”\n\nSEC Chair Gensler Again Says Bitcoin Is Not a Security. What About Ethereum?\n\nIn the June lawsuit against Coinbase, the SEC, however, didn’t mention Ethereum (ETH), the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, among those tokens it asserted to be securities.\n\nOn June 28, the San Francisco-based company filed a motion to dismiss the SEC’s lawsuit, arguing that the agency does not have statutory authority over the exchange and that its position regarding its powers is “untenable as a matter of law.”\n\nEditor\'s note: This article was updated on July 31, 2023 at 6 am Eastern Standard Time to include comment from Coinbase.'}, {'id': 5, 'time': 'Mon, 31 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "'Crypto couple' to plead guilty in $4.5 billion bitcoin heist - Business Insider", 'content': 'The "crypto couple" Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan are due for a plea hearing on Thursday.\n\nThe couple are expected to plead guilty to orchestrating a $4.5 billion bitcoin-laundering scheme.\n\nThey were arrested in 2022 following what the DOJ called its "largest financial seizure."\n\nNEW LOOK Sign up to get the inside scoop on today’s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business — delivered daily.

The second largest occurred later that same year, when the feds seized $3.36 billion worth of bitcoin that had been stolen from a dark-web site years earlier.\n\nLichtenstein and Morgan, Federal prosecutors have alleged, "employed numerous sophisticated laundering techniques," creating fake identities to set up online accounts, depositing the funds into virtual currency exchanges and dark-web markets, and converting them into other virtual currencies — all to cover their tracks.\n\nLichtenstein and Morgan are charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to defraud the United States. Together, the charges carry a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn attorney for both Lichtenstein and Morgan did not respond to a request for comment ahead of Thursday\'s plea hearing.\n\nOlivier Douliery/Getty Images\n\nThe saga began in August 2016 when the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex was hacked. As Insider previously reported, Lichtenstein and Morgan were not accused of carrying out the hack itself, but as a result of the hack, 119,754 bitcoins were moved into an outside wallet Lichtenstein controlled.\n\nThat bitcoin amounted to $71 million by January 2017, at which point the IRS began tracing thousands of transactions moving through dozens of accounts — eventually landing in Lichtenstein\'s and Morgan\'s personal accounts.\n\nAt the time, the couple said the bitcoin came from investments that predated 2015, but Lichtenstein kept highly detailed notes about the scheme in cloud storage, which authorities eventually gained access to. Among the documents authorities found was a list of 2,000 virtual currency addresses and their private keys, all of which could be traced back to the hack. Authorities also found a spreadsheet with login information for cryptocurrency-exchange accounts, with notes about which accounts were frozen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProsecutors also alleged that Lichtenstein and Morgan had been planning to flee to Russia under new identities.\n\nAuthorities found a folder in Lichtenstein\'s cloud storage labeled "personas" with information on how to use the dark web to obtain fake identities. While executing a search warrant on the couple\'s home, authorities found hollowed-out books, dozens of electronic devices, a bag labeled "burner phones," $40,000 in cash, and foreign currency.\n\nSince their 2022 arrests, Morgan has been on house arrest on a $3 million bond, and court records said she had a new job as a "growth marketing and business development specialist" at an undisclosed tech company. Lichtenstein, whom prosecutors have described as a flight risk over his Russian citizenship, has remained incarcerated.'}, {'id': 24, 'time': 'Mon, 31 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Bitcoin 3.0: Supporting the Energy Future of the Planet - Nasdaq', 'content': 'By Sanjay Gupta, Head of Strategy, Auradine Inc.\n\nBitcoin, the first blockchain network and most popular cryptocurrency, has come a long way since its inception in 2009. What started as a niche hobby for cyberpunks and speculators has grown into a global phenomenon with increasing adoption. In order to understand the future trajectory and impact of Bitcoin, it’s important to examine the historical evolution of Bitcoin— both the technology and asset class— its breakthroughs and shortcomings, and what is necessary to reach adoption on a global scale.\n\nIn this blog, we will explore the road to “Bitcoin 3.0”, what we consider to be the near future state of Bitcoin and its potential to support the energy future of the planet. When implemented and deployed responsibly, Bitcoin mining provides capabilities that can support base energy loads, provide stability to mismatched energy demand and supply characteristics, drive the growth of renewable infrastructure, and enable grid modernization. Breakthroughs in hardware and software optimization are the next step in enabling Bitcoin to scale sustainably and achieve optimal impact worldwide.\n\nSustainable and scalable evolution of Bitcoin 3.0\n\nSource: Auradine\n\nBitcoin 1.0: Early days – “The Hobbyist Era”\n\nBitcoin 1.0 refers to the early days of Bitcoin, when it was mainly used by hobbyists and speculators who were fascinated by the allure of Satoshi’s groundbreaking white paper, innovative technology, and its potential to create a decentralized, peer-to-peer, trustless form of money. Bitcoin 1.0 was characterized by trial adoption with primarily speculative use cases. At this time, while the blockchain technology that powered Bitcoin was beginning to be understood as a decentralized, trustless system, it was also exploited for illicit uses that took advantage of its anonymous and global reach as an exchange of value. Bitcoin 1.0 however laid the foundation for the subsequent crypto revolution and proved that it was possible to create a digital currency that operates without intermediaries and central authorities.\n\nBitcoin 2.0: Rapid mining growth “The Industrialized Mining Era”\n\nBitcoin 2.0 refers to the most recent phase of Bitcoin, where the days of mining in dorm rooms and basements were replaced by a rapid rise of industrial-scale miners and global hashing capacity being measured in Exahash/second (1018 hashes/second!). The Bitcoin security protocol uses a ‘proof of work’ (PoW) consensus mechanism and requires participants or ‘miners’ to validate transactions on the block approximately every 10 minutes. Successful miners earn Bitcoin block rewards in addition to any transaction fees.\n\nWhen Bitcoin mining is done at scale, the needed compute speed requires large numbers of specialized ASIC-based computers. These consume significant quantities of energy, which has been an ongoing focus of considerable analysis and debate.\n\nDuring this time, ideas around Bitcoin as a store of value and a legitimate asset gained increasing momentum. For example, Bitcoin was seen as a valuable means for transacting ‘crisis capital’ in situations of natural or man-made calamities, such as aid at the outset of the Ukraine war. Bitcoin is also experiencing increasing use as an exchange of value in payments for goods and services with initial merchant acceptance enablement.\n\nBitcoin 2.0 attracted the attention and participation of institutional investors, corporations, governments, and regulators, who saw its potential to transform the financial system.\n\nBitcoin 3.0: The Next Phase “Responsible Partner of the Energy and Financial Ecosystem”\n\nBitcoin 3.0 refers to the next evolution of Bitcoin, and, where used properly, can make Bitcoin a responsible partner of the energy and financial ecosystems.\n\nIn addition to the use cases of Bitcoin 2.0 as a store of value, the next era of Bitcoin is poised for increasing use as an exchange of value with widespread merchant acceptance. In the recent past, there has been a rise of NFT-like applications called ‘ordinals’ where data can be immutably etched onto a micro-building block of Bitcoin called a Satoshi (100 million Satoshis = 1 Bitcoin) and as a currency hedge in countries facing hyperinflation.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin 3.0’s most important use can be as a store for excess and wasted energy that can support the energy future of the planet. Using large quantities of computational power is necessary to support the security aspect of Bitcoin, something that makes it robust compared to other blockchains. But this computational power can be harnessed productively, as the extent of computational power consumed can be deployed to balance the energy grid using rapid demand response, drive sustainable investment in renewable energy and reduce carbon emissions by reducing gas flaring. This is a massive breakthrough. With systems purpose-built to support Bitcoin 3.0, Bitcoin can become a responsible partner to the energy ecosystem and a strong net positive contribut...'}, {'id': 25, 'time': 'Mon, 31 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Bitcoin, Ether drop in Asia afternoon trading amid DeFi hack reports; most other leading tokens decline - Yahoo Finance', 'content': 'Bitcoin and Ether prices fell in early Tuesday afternoon trading in Asia, with Bitcoin losing support at US$29,000, amid concern about the hack of the popular decentralized finance platform Curve Finance over the weekend that saw an estimated US$41 million stolen and raised concerns about a DeFi contagion.

The news articles highlight regulatory challenges faced by Coinbase from the SEC, with the SEC requesting the delisting of most crypto tokens except Bitcoin, leading to legal action. This regulatory uncertainty could impact the cryptocurrency market, particularly for altcoins, as the focus shifts towards Bitcoin. Additionally, reports of DeFi hacks and concerns about security in the crypto space could lead to a decrease in investor confidence, potentially causing a short-term decline in the market. However, the potential for Bitcoin to support the energy future of the planet and the upcoming Litecoin halving event could provide some positive sentiment in the market.

You are an experienced ETH cryptocurrency trader and you are trying to maximize your overall profit by trading ETH. In each day, you will make an action to buy or sell ETH. You are assisted by a few analysts below and need to decide the final action.

ON-CHAIN ANALYST REPORT:
"""
The recent data shows that the open price of ETH has been fluctuating around the $29,000 mark, with average transaction fees ranging from 0.0012 to 0.0020. The total value transferred has also been varying, indicating active trading activity. The total size used and unique addresses have shown some fluctuations as well. Despite some variability in the data, the MACD signal consistently indicates a buy trend. Overall, the market trend for ETH appears to be bullish, with potential for further price increases in the near future.
"""

NEWS ANALYST REPORT:
"""
The news articles highlight regulatory challenges faced by Coinbase from the SEC, with the SEC requesting the delisting of most crypto tokens except Bitcoin, leading to legal action. This regulatory uncertainty could impact the cryptocurrency market, particularly for altcoins, as the focus shifts towards Bitcoin. Additionally, reports of DeFi hacks and concerns about security in the crypto space could lead to a decrease in investor confidence, potentially causing a short-term decline in the market. However, the potential for Bitcoin to support the energy future of the planet and the upcoming Litecoin halving event could provide some positive sentiment in the market. Overall, the market trend may experience volatility and cautious trading in the near term.

*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the data indicates a bullish trend for ETH, with fluctuations in various metrics but a consistent buy signal from the MACD. The active trading activity and potential for further price increases suggest a positive outlook for ETH in the near future.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights regulatory challenges and concerns in the cryptocurrency market, which could lead to short-term volatility and cautious trading. The focus on Bitcoin due to regulatory uncertainty and security issues in the DeFi space may impact altcoins like ETH.

In reflection, the combination of on-chain analysis, news reports, and strategic risk management has been successful in identifying bullish trends and maximizing profits in the ETH market. Long-term strategies have proven effective in navigating short-term volatility and external factors.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is advisable to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains in the current market environment. Despite potential regulatory challenges and market volatility, a conservative trading approach is recommended to ensure sustained profitability.

Therefore, my trading action would be to buy ETH with a confidence level of 0.7, indicating a moderately high confidence in the bullish trend for ETH and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately for long-term gains.

Earlier in the day it briefly fell to about $28,800. It ended July down 3.93%.\n\nEther , which has joined bitcoin in recent months as a sort of large cap, blue-chip trade in crypto, also cut its Tuesday losses and was last down by 0.5% at $1,850.17, after finishing July lower by 3.35%. It was under extra pressure due to a recent exploit in DeFi giant Curve, however.\n\n"Ethereum is sort of the king of DeFi and Curve is viewed as one of the most important liquidity providers in DeFi," said Josh Gilbert, an analyst at investment firm eToro. "[Ethereum] is a massive project so it\'s not going to come under as much pressure as smaller alts but that Curve issue is ultimately the reason we\'re seeing weakness in Ethereum right now."\n\nAltcoins fell after a federal judge said some crypto assets are securities regardless of the context in which they are sold. This opinion contradicted an earlier ruling from the same district court that said Ripple\'s XRP may not be categorized as a security in all circumstances. XRP was last down 1.5%, having also recovered earlier losses.\n\nOther tokens named in the recent SEC lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase as potential securities inched closer to unchanged after being under pressure earlier, including those tied to the Solana and Cardano networks, which at one point fell more than 2%.\n\nDeFi giant hacked\n\nOther smaller coins, specifically in the DeFi segment of the market, recovered losses, too. CRV, the native token of Curve Finance, a stablecoin-focused decentralized exchange, was up 8% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko. Aave cut its 9% loss in the same period and was little changed, while the tokens tied to Compound and the Synthetix network were down 5% and 4%, respectively.\n\nCurve, a stablecoin exchange built on Ethereum, was exploited Sunday due to a bug in the smart contract programming language called Vyper. The hacker targeted three liquidity pools for tokens paired with ether and CRV as well as several ERC-20 tokens issued on Alchemix (alETH), Metronome Synth (smETH) and JPEG\'d (pETH). It drained as much as $100 million worth of cryptocurrency from the platform, including $20 million of CRV and a version of ether, according to CryptoQuant.\n\n"We\'ve unfortunately had this scenario in crypto a few times over the past 12 to 18 months. Whenever investors hear the word hack ... it puts the whole crypto market on the backfoot and that\'s what\'s happening here," Gilbert said.\n\nBitcoin volumes have also dropped significantly from their recent highs, despite the price of bitcoin proving so resilient this year. It traded in a tight range throughout July, neither breaking above a key level of $31,500 nor below $25,200, and has soared 76% in 2023.\n\n"We had a lot of buzz recently around the Blackrock ETF but that can only drive bitcoin for so long and for so far. We got plenty of optimism with it but that initial optimism is fading slightly," Gilbert said. "When bitcoin heads south so do most altcoins ... and they\'re selling off a little bit further given what we\'re seeing with Curve."'}]

By digitally validating transactions in an attempt to prevent fraud and adding new blocks to the blockchain ledger, mining helps create new Bitcoins in a decentralized way.\n\nHistorically, it has been observed that bitcoin mining may remain profitable even during down markets for cryptocurrencies, while they habitually prosper when things are looking up. In a sense, by lending credence to cryptocurrency, bitcoin miners have assumed a defensive nature in the world of crypto.\n\nThere are obvious sectoral headwinds like high production costs and lower revenues per block mined that miners face during a downturn. However, in a year where the price of Bitcoin (BTC) has gone up 74.6% as of Aug 1, these overheads can be offset.\n\nThere is a bigger problem on the horizon though, with the scheduled April 2024 halving lurking around the corner. The halving is a planned reduction of Bitcoin emissions in each block and takes place every four years. This entails miners to deal with the sudden shock of revenues falling down by exactly half.\n\nHowever, because of its non-sudden nature, bitcoin miners have had a chance to prepare for the event. They have resorted to selling to improve their cashflows and sending large amounts of BTC to exchanges as a part of the de-risking strategy. For example, selling BTC one-year futures allows miners to lock in a selling price of $30,000 for the next year.\n\nSo, with a “crypto spring” in the offing in 2023 and bitcoin miners already preparing their strategies for next year’s halving, it would be prudent to watch a few bitcoin mining stocks that have done exceedingly well this year.\n\nHut 8 Mining Corp. HUT: This cryptocurrency mining company from North America provides computing power to the mining pools in exchange for digital assets. It is one of the world’s largest crypto mining companies, and its shares have soared 318.8% year to date (as of Jul 31).\n\nStory continues\n\nHut 8’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 50%. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStronghold Digital Mining, Inc. SDIG: This is a crypto asset mining company that focuses on mining Bitcoin in the United States. Its shares have climbed 85.2% year to date (as of Jul 31).\n\nStronghold Digital Mining’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 92.7%. Stronghold Digital Mining currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nHIVE Digital Technologies Ltd. HIVE: This cryptocurrency mining company operates in Canada, Sweden and Iceland. It engages in the mining and sale of digital currencies. Its shares have surged 276.4% year to date (as of Jul 31).\n\nHIVE’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 78.1%. HIVE currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nMicroStrategy Incorporated MSTR: This is an enterprise analytics software and services provider operating in the United States, Canada, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and globally. Among other activities, MicroStrategy mines, holds and acquires Bitcoin. Its shares have jumped 209.3% year to date (as of Jul 31).\n\nMicroStrategy’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 125.7%. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nBottom Line\n\nBitcoin mining companies have been rallying in 2023. Being regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, these companies project “stability” to investors on a perception level, an attribute uncommon to the volatile crypto market.

The 10-year Treasury yield chalked out a similar drop and pop to hover above 4%. Bitcoin tends to move in the opposite direction of the greenback and bond yields.\n\nTwo of the so-called big three rating agencies have now placed the default rating at AA+. Moody\'s still has a top rating of AAA.\n\nThe S&P downgraded the U.S. to AA+ on Aug. 5, 2011, following which the dollar index and Treasury yields initially declined but quickly bounced back. Stocks tumbled, with bitcoin falling over 38% in the same month, data from TradingView show. The only major asset to rally alongside DXY was gold, which gained over 10%.\n\nThe dollar index and Treasury yields rose after the S&P downgraded U.S. on Aug. 5, 2011.\n\nIf history is a guide, the dollar index looks set to rise further, bringing more pain to bitcoin and stocks, although impending buying pressure from MicroStrategy might support the cryptocurrency\'s price.\n\nRead More: Bitcoin Whale Michael Saylor Might Buy a Lot More BTC\n\nStory continues\n\nAs of writing, futures tied to the S&P 500, Wall Street\'s benchmark equity index pointed to a negative open with a 0.5% drop. As Asia began its business day, bitcoin jumped past $30,000 after software developer and bitcoin whale MicroStrategy submitted a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to sell up to $750 million in stock with the intent of using the capital to purchase more BTC.\n\nMajor U.S. equity indexes – Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 – fell 0.4% and 0.3%, on Tuesday.\n\nIn a note to CoinDesk, Mark Connors, the head of research at Canadian digital asset manager 3iQ, wrote that the recent "shift in market sentiment was NOT limited to digital assets, as equities took a breather."\n\n"Our bellwether cross asset correlation metric hit a 20Y high as bonds and equities sold off," Connors wrote. "Looking forward, we will monitor for any sharp reversal from this historically high correlation - as that has often signaled a risk reversal."\n\nETH, CRV track BTC lower\n\nThe CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of crypto markets performance, pulled back from $1,290 to $1,279, but was still up 2% on a 24-hour basis.\n\nEther, the native token of Ethereum, fell 0.5% from early Asian session highs to $1,860 taking cues from bitcoin\'s negative turnaround. Per one analyst, ether is overvalued and could slide further. Options market is seeing price weakness over the next six months.\n\nCurve\'s CRV token pulled back 5% to 58 cents. The cryptocurrency rose more than 20% to over 62 cents on Tuesday, likely on the back of a short squeeze. The increase came after Sun purchased more than $2 million worth of the token and pledged additional assistance through a liquidity pool on the Tron network. Curve fell victim to an exploit late Sunday, triggering a sell-off in CRV that got the market worried about potential liquidation of Curve founder\'s large borrowed position.\n\n"Clearly, there are fears over a liquidation cascade happening within the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem, Richard Mico, the U.S. CEO of payment-and-compliance infrastructure provider BanxaI, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. "I don’t know how likely such a cascade is, but the market seems jittery as a result of these metastasizing issues. What’s ironic is that DeFi had held up so well during the blowups of 2022, and yet it’s an exploit more recently that might be the trigger for a DeFi blowup itself now."\n\nMico added that a judge\'s ruling against stablecoin issuer Terraform Labs\' motion to dismiss a lawsuit against the SEC might "be adding to the relatively soft sentiment in the market," but he noted that investors were buying up bitcoin\'s recent "dips below $29,000...pretty quickly," a sign that buyers are accumulating in expectation of the SEC approving one of the recent spot BTC ETF applications.\n\nSee more: Get professional-grade crypto data and news at CoinDeskMarkets.com\n\nUPDATE (August 1, 2023, 23:43 UTC): Changes...'}]

REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing a bullish trend, with increasing open prices, total value transferred, and overall positive indicators. The macd_signal consistently showing a buy signal further supports this bullish outlook. 

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights some regulatory challenges that could create short-term volatility in the market. However, positive developments such as BlackRock's ETF push for Bitcoin and Ripple's legal victory suggest long-term prospects for Bitcoin and ETH remain positive.

Reflecting on the combination of on-chain analysis, news reports, and strategic risk management, it is evident that a conservative trading approach prioritizing long-term gains over short-term fluctuations is crucial for sustained profitability in the volatile cryptocurrency market.

Therefore, considering the overall bullish trend in the market and the importance of long-term strategies, I would take a trading action with a confidence level of 0.8, indicating a strong belief in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.

And $2.4 billion of its total $5.5 billion Q2 net revenue came from Bitcoin, the company said.\n\nThe company—formerly known as Square—saw a 34% increase in Bitcoin revenue compared to the same period in 2022. Bitcoin revenue refers to the total sale amount of cryptocurrency sold to customers.\n\n"We delivered strong growth and profitability at scale during the second quarter of 2023," the company said in a letter to shareholders.\n\nBlock\'s Cash App business Bitcoin revenue stood at $1.16 billion, a 39% increase compared to the same period in 2022. If not for a dip in prices, the company said, the revenue could have contributed even more to its bottom line.\n\n"The year-over-year increase in Bitcoin revenue and gross profit was driven by an increase in the quantity of Bitcoin sold to customers, partially offset by a decrease in the average market price of Bitcoin compared to the prior-year period," the company said in a letter to shareholders.\n\nThe company also recorded no impairment losses on its Bitcoin holdings, which now total $245 million, in the three- and six-month periods ending June 30, 2023.\n\nBlock’s Cash App Bitcoin Revenue Drops 25% Year-Over-Year\n\nAn impairment charge refers to a loss of value in assets—in this case, the digital assets held by the company.\n\nBlock is a payments company founded by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey. Its popular mobile app, Cash App, is a popular tool for buying and selling Bitcoin.\n\nThe app last year installed the Bitcoin "second-layer solution" the Lightning Network—allowing users to make small and quick payments with crypto.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n\nThe move shows just how committed the company is to pushing Bitcoin adoption. In June, Dorsey-backed Bitkey launched the beta for its Bitcoin wallet, which will allow users withdraw BTC from their Coinbase and Cash App wallets using "copy and paste."'}, {'id': 66, 'time': 'Thu, 03 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Bitfinex Hacker Revealed: Razzlekhan's Husband Admits He Stole Billions in Bitcoin - Yahoo Finance", 'content': 'Ilya Lichtenstein, who last month agreed to forfeit billions in a plea deal for his role in laundering funds from a 2016 hack of crypto exchange Bitfinex, has now admitted he was the hacker.\n\nAlthough it has long been suspected either Lichtenstein or his wife, Heather Morgan, were the ones who stole 120,900 Bitcoin, it\'s only now been confirmed. The new detail was originally reported by CNBC on Thursday.\n\nThe couple appeared at a sentencing hearing today in Washington D.C.\n\nBitfinex Hackers Agree to Forfeit Billions in Bitcoin in Plea Deal\n\nDuring the court hearing, the Bitfinex hacker also admitted that he and his wife converted some of the stolen crypto assets to gold coins and buried them. According to CNBC’s account of the hearing, Lichtenstein flew to Ukraine and Kazakhstan to convert the crypto to cash before depositing the funds in an American bank account.\n\nLichtenstein and Morgan (also known by her rapper name "Razzlekhan") were arrested early last year on charges of having laundered the funds stolen from Bitfinex in 2016. They could face up to 20 years in prison.\n\nAs part of their plea deal, the couple has agreed to forfeit proceeds from the almost 120,000 Bitcoin they stand accused of laundering. At the time of their arrest, the Department of Justice seized $3.6 billion worth of Bitcoin it believed to be connected to the 2016 hack.\n\nAt the time, Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco said in a press release it was the department’s largest ever seizure of crypto assets and proved “cryptocurrency is not a safe haven for criminals.”\n\nBitfinex Recovers $314K of the $3.6 Billion Stolen in 2016 Bitcoin Hack\n\nBefore the arrest, investors were keen to track the funds using blockchain data—a maddening bit of transparency for victims who can see their funds being moved around. A few weeks before the plea deal was announced in July, Bitfinex recovered a small portion of the Bitcoin Cash, about $314 thousand, that was taken during the 2016 hack. But the majority of the funds still have not been returned to users.\n\nEditor\'s Note: This story was updated at 4 p.m. ET on Thursday, August 3 to add additional details about the hearing and context about the hack.'}, {'id': 25, 'time': 'Thu, 03 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Global X files for ETF that combines bitcoin futures and T-bills - Financial Times', 'content': 'Print this page\n\nSimply sign up to the Exchange traded funds myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nLatest news on ETFs Visit our ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools\n\nGlobal X has filed to launch an ETF that will alternate between allocating to Bitcoin futures and the firm’s recently launched Treasury bill ETF, a regulatory filing shows.\n\nThe Global X Bitcoin Trend Strategy ETF will dynamically and systematically allocate between the United States and, once available, Canadian exchange traded bitcoin futures contracts and the Global X 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF, a passively managed ETF that launched this year, the ETF’s prospectus states.\n\nThe latter ETF launched on June 20 and has amassed $42mn in assets, according to data from Morningstar Direct.\n\nThe manager’s largest ETF is the Nasdaq 100 Covered Call ETF, filings show.

The Securities and Exchange Commission has repeatedly shot down those applications because of concerns about potential manipulation and a lack of surveillance from the exchanges on which the ETFs would be listed.\n\nLast month, BlackRock set off the latest flurry of new applications or reapplications when it filed to launch a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nBlackRock’s application was quickly followed by similar applications from VanEck, Valkyrie, Fidelity, Invesco, WisdomTree and Bitwise. Ark Invest filed to launch a spot bitcoin ETF in April.\n\nThose spot filings should not be an impediment to the Global X ETF, Armour said.\n\n“This strategy has a risk-off mechanism that can cause performance to differ significantly from bitcoin itself,” he said. “There could also be a long runway to a spot bitcoin ETF, leaving plenty of time for Global X and others to go after that market.”\n\nIgnites is a news service published by FT Specialist for professionals working in the asset management industry.

Ilya "Dutch" Lichtenstein, 35, made that bombshell admission while pleading guilty to laundering the stolen bitcoin in Washington, D.C., federal court. The plea came before his wife, 33-year-old Heather Rhiannon Morgan, who was in the audience, stepped up to enter her own guilty plea to two charges, money laundering conspiracy and conspiracy to defraud the United States government. Until Thursday\'s admission in court by Lichtenstein, it was not publicly known who had hacked the bitcoin from the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex. The couple was not charged in the hack itself.\n\nBooking photos for Heather Morgan and Ilya Lichtenstein. Courtesy: Alexandria Adult Detention Center.\n\nLichtenstein faces a maximum possible sentence of 20 years in prison for one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. The Russian emigre, has been held without bond since his arrest after a judge ruled he is a flight risk, will remain jailed until his sentencing, and has agreed to cooperate with federal investigators. Morgan, an aspiring rapper known as "Razzlekhan" and "The Crocodile of Wall Street," faces a maximum possible sentence of five years in prison. She was in the courtroom for her husband\'s plea hearing. Morgan has been free on $3 million bond since her arrest. Lichtenstein smiled at her and blew her a kiss during their moment of eye contact, the first time they had seen each other in more than a year.\n\nCourtroom sketch of Ilya "Dutch" Lichtenstein while pleading guilty to laundering the stolen bitcoin in Washington, D.C., federal court. Artist: William Hennessey\n\nWhen they were arrested in February 2022, the Department of Justice said officials had seized more than 94,000 bitcoin of the more than 119,000 hacked bitcoin. The seized cryptocurrency at the time was worth about $3.6 billion, making it the largest seizure in DOJ history. "Since their arrests, the government has seized another approximately $475 million tied to the hack," the DOJ said in a press statement Thursday. Bitfinex in a statement said, "Following the August 2016 hack, Bitfinex engaged in unprecedented efforts to make its customers whole." "Bitfinex also diligently worked with the U.S. Department of Justice to identify the perpetrators of the hack, recover the stolen bitcoin, and bring the hackers to justice," the company said. "After seven years, those efforts have come to fruition." When the bitcoin was stolen, it was worth just $70 million. But its value soared over the years to $4.5 billion. In its statement Thursday, the DOJ said, "Lichtenstein used a number of advanced hacking tools and techniques to gain access to Bitfinex\'s network." "Once inside their systems, Lichtenstein fraudulently authorized more than 2,000 transactions in which 119,754 bitcoin was transferred from Bitfinex to a cryptocurrency wallet in Lichtenstein\'s control," the DOJ said.\n\nHeather Rhiannon Morgan, who was in the audience, stepped up to enter her own guilty plea hearing in the case. Artist: William Hennessey\n\n"Lichtenstein then took steps to cover his tracks by going back into Bitfinex\'s network and deleting access credentials and other log files that may have given him away to law enforcement" the DOJ said. "Following the hack, Lichtenstein enlisted the help of his wife, Morgan, in laundering the stolen funds." When the couple was arrested in early 2022, the department said about "25,000 of those stolen bitcoin were transferred out of Lichtenstein\'s wallet via a complicated money laundering process that ended with some of the stolen funds being deposited into financial accounts controlled by Lichtenstein and Morgan."\n\nHeather Rhiannon Morgan, who was in the audience, stepped up to enter her own guilty plea hearing in the case. Artist: William Hennessey\n\nDuring Lichtenstein\'s plea hearing, it was revealed that he had converted some assets to gold coins, and that Morgan had buried gold coins at a location now known to law enforcement officials. And it also was revealed that Lichtenstein\'s past travel to Ukraine and Kazakhstan was done to convert digital assets to cash through Russian and Ukrainian middlemen. That cash was then shipped to addresses in Russia and Ukraine, where Lichtenstein picked it up physically and deposited it into U.S. accounts so he could retrieve it while in New York City. The Crypto Couple\'s separate plea hearings were moved up from their originally scheduled times Thursday due to arraignment later in the afternoon at the same courthouse of Donald Trump. The former president was charged Thursday in that case with crimes related to an effort to overturn his 2020 election loss. A charging document filed last month against the couple says that in early 2107 Lichtenstein "began to move a portion of the bitcoin" stolen in the hack "in a series of small, complex transactions across ...'}]

Authorities recovered the funds from wallets controlled by the duo.Since their arrests, the government has seized another approximately $475 million tied to the hack, the Southern District of New York said in a statement.In total, the couple admitted to laundering conspiracies arising from the theft of approximately 120,000 bitcoin from Bitfinex , a global cryptocurrency exchange.The charges carry a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison.Prosecutors said that Lichtenstein, at times with Morgan\'s help, "employed numerous sophisticated laundering techniques."That included using fictitious identities to set up online accounts and utilizing computer programs to automate transactions.They deposited the stolen funds into accounts in a variety of darknet markets and cryptocurrency exchanges and then withdrew the money, which confuses the transaction history.They couple also converted bitcoin to other forms of cryptocurrency and even exchanged a portion of the stolen funds into gold coins, which Morgan then concealed by burying them.One of Morgan\'s aliases was "Razzlekhan" while Lichtenstein was known as "Dutch."The couple were dubbed "Bitcoin Bonnie and Crypto Clyde" by financial newsletter Morning Brew'}, {'id': 5, 'time': 'Fri, 04 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Whistleblower Edward Snowden to Headline the Bitcoin Amsterdam Conference - Nasdaq', 'content': 'The Bitcoin Amsterdam Conference is thrilled to welcome renowned whistleblower and cybersecurity expert, Edward Snowden, to its landmark event, where he will share his insights on the intersection of digital currency, privacy, and the future of financial freedom during a 45 minute long online talk with a Q&A session.\n\nThe event will take place in Westergas, Amsterdam on October 12-13, 2023 and will bring together industry leaders, enthusiasts, and experts to discuss the future of bitcoin, decentralization and freedom.\n\n\n\n\n\n“In 2013, Ed Snowden alerted the American people to the fact that the US Government was knowingly conducting warrantless surveillance of its own citizens; a violation of basic rights.

Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoiners rejoiced this week when KPMG, one of the “big four” worldwide accounting firms, published a report that underscored how the protocol can contribute in a positive manner to the three pillars of the ESG investing framework: environmental, social, and governance.\n\nKPMG’s research is pivotal, says CH4 Capital co-founder and renowned ESG analyst, Daniel Batten.\n\n“No matter what your view on ESG, demonstrating how Bitcoin makes positive contributions [to environment, social and governance initiatives] is critical to both mainstream and institutional comfort,” he told Decrypt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to Batten, the KPMG report—titled “Bitcoin’s role in the ESG Imperative”—is an “important moment, because it represents for the first time a mainstream financial institution having gone through a thorough due diligence process on Bitcoin.”\n\nThe report documents a deep dive in the framework’s three pillars, beginning with the environmental aspect of Bitcoin mining–the energy intensive and controversial process through which new BTC is created. KPMG says the mining industry “is focused on driving towards Net Zero emissions.”\n\nKPMG showcases how Bitcoin emissions compare to other key worldwide industries (such as tourism and fashion), elucidating it is a mere fraction. The publication outlines several strategies towards reducing the network's carbon footprint, including using renewable energy, and recycled heat among others.\n\nBatten, an expert on ESG matters, explained to Decrypt that he is surprised by the thoroughness of the report. “It's usual for reports to let certain folklore slip through the due diligence process such as ‘but Bitcoin takes renewable energy away from other users,’” he said, praising the KPMG team for the quality of their research and publishing what he considers to be “non-obvious truths.”\n\nThe social aspect of the report touches upon the hotly debated “Bitcoin is for criminals,” narrative, pointing to a recent Chainalysis report. U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has repeatedly asserted that cryptocurrency is a favored tool of criminals, fueling societal ills like the fentanyl epidemic.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKPMG countered these claims with the opportunities the protocol presents for financial inclusion, such as crowdfunding Ukraine’s efforts in its war with Russia, providing access to electricity in Africa, and the role it plays for minorities around the world.\n\nLast but not least, KPMG addresses the governance aspect of Bitcoin, and the decentralized aspect of the network specifically, which it writes is one of its “most prominent features.” The report acknowledges that the network’s rules cannot be changed or modified by those in power, pointing to a “robust” governance structure that provides a “high degree of confidence” in the overall system.\n\nThe report concludes that Bitcoin provides a number of positive benefits under an ESG investing framework, and ends with a series of questions for ecosystem players–prompting users, miners and other organizations to assess their relationship to the ecosystem.\n\n“I think it's an important report and a milestone the ecosystem should celebrate,” Batten tells Decrypt. He remarked that “It's important people read reports put out by Bitcoin opponents,” although Batten reckons “there is still much work to be done, with several mainstream news channels continuing to publish misinformation about Bitcoin with impunity.”\n\nHe concluded, however, that “this will improve education and help the intellectually curious person to form an informed viewpoint on the utility of Bitcoin.”"}, {'id': 14, 'time': 'Sat, 05 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'I made eerie Bitcoin prediction 10 years ago – no one listened but now I’m living the dream after becoming... - The Sun', 'content': 'IF anyone has the authority to say "I told you so", it\'s got to be the bloke who predicted the Bitcoin boom a decade ago.\n\nDavinci Jeremie urged people to take a chance on the cryptocurrency for just $1 (78p), but his desperate pleas were largely ignored.\n\n5 Davinci Jeremie now lives a life of luxury after investing in Bitcoin Credit: Instagram/@davincij15\n\n5 The cryptocurrency king urged people to invest for just 79p a decade ago Credit: Instagram/@davincij15\n\n5 The self-made millionaire poked fun at people who ignored his advice Credit: Instagram/@davincij15\n\nHowever, he has certainly had the last laugh - as betting on Bitcoin\'s success on the global market has paid off massively.\n\nDespite his eerie prediction being overlooked by his online followers, Davinci stuck to his guns and gambled his own cash.\n\nThe risk has since made him filthy rich - and the crypto king now boasts a net worth of more than $10million (£7.2million).\n\nHe is never too far away from a fast car, private jet or yacht filled with glamourous women ready to whisk him away.\n\nREAD MORE ON BITCOIN THE CRYPTO JOB How ‘Crocodile of Wall Street’ rapper stole £3.5BILLION worth of Bitcoin\n\nLet\'s hope Davinci spares a thought for those who shrugged off his claims about crypto ten years ago.\n\nThe Chilean software developer first introduced Bitcoin to his audience in 2011, where he hailed it as "amazing stuff."\n\nHe admitted he was even sceptical of cryptocurrencies at first, but changed his mind after looking into it further.\n\nTwo years later, Davinci returned to his YouTube channel to encourage viewers to invest in the virtual currency for just $1 (78p).\n\nHe said: "Look, for the price of a lotto ticket you can hold Bitcoin for 10 years and become a millionaire.\n\n"It\'s time you stop living in fear.

Conceived as a store of value and a means of value transfer, Bitcoin has fundamentally transformed our understanding of what a digital asset can be. Prior to the invention of Bitcoin, digital files could only be replicated and never actually transferred. The concept of transferring ownership of a digital asset in a way that unambiguously assures that the original possessor no longer owns it was a complex problem that Bitcoin ingeniously solved. This solution lies in the immutable ledger of the blockchain, where each transaction is recorded in a transparent manner, allowing anyone to witness the debit and credit. One of the most intriguing parts of Bitcoin is the idea of ‘Bitcoin halving.’ For the first time in technology history, we have a digital asset that is designed to be rare, a feature that has far-reaching consequences for the future of digital currencies.\n\nBitcoin’s Limited Supply: A Key Feature\n\nA distinguishing characteristic of Bitcoin is its limited supply. Unlike traditional fiat currencies that can be printed at will, Bitcoin has a predetermined maximum supply of 21 million coins. To ensure the digital currency’s scarcity and value, its creators made a deliberate design decision to limit its supply.\n\nBitcoin Halving: A Mechanism Ensuring Scarcity\n\nBitcoin’s scarcity is maintained through a process known as Bitcoin halving. Approximately every four years, the number of new Bitcoins created through mining is cut in half. This reduction in the rate of new coin creation ensures that the supply grows at a decreasing pace, ultimately leading to a fixed maximum supply.\n\nThe Significance of Bitcoin Halving Events\n\nBitcoin halving is a significant event in the Bitcoin network that occurs once every 210,000 blocks. It is a process aimed at reducing the reward given to miners for validating transactions and adding them to the blockchain. This reduction is done by 50% every halving event, thereby reducing the rate at which new Bitcoins are generated. This means that the block reward will halve or decrease by half, which will give miners 3.125 of newly minted Bitcoin per validated block. Since a new block of transactions is completed roughly every 10 minutes, this works out to an average Bitcoin halving event every four years. The next halving will happen around April–May 2024.\n\nThe limited supply of Bitcoin has had a profound impact on its value. As the demand for Bitcoins increases and the supply remains restricted, the scarcity factor amplifies its perceived value. This scarcity-driven value proposition has made Bitcoin a highly sought-after digital asset. Historically, in the months immediately following a halving event, Bitcoin pricing didn’t show much movement. It usually started heating up around 12 to 18 months after a halving. However, it’s not quite clear that the spikes in prices 12 to 18 months after the halving events actually correlate exclusively with the halving. Other forces could cause Bitcoin to spike or drop before or after the halving as well.\n\nImplications of Bitcoin Halving on the Ecosystem\n\nBitcoin halving events have profound implications for the Bitcoin ecosystem. As the block reward decreases, miners are incentivized to compete more aggressively for the remaining reward. This can lead to increased mining difficulty and a higher level of network security. Additionally, halving events often trigger a surge in the price of Bitcoin, as the reduced supply creates a sense of scarcity and increased demand.\n\nThe impact of halving events extends beyond the immediate effects on miners and the price of Bitcoin. The reduction in block rewards also affects the economics of mining, as miners need to carefully manage their operational costs and revenue streams. Some miners may choose to exit the market altogether if the reduced rewards make mining unprofitable, while others may seek out more efficient mining hardware and strategies to maintain profitability.\n\nIncrease in consolidation in the industry also leads to establishment of mining groups resulting in their advantage over individual miners who cannot keep up with the operational costs. Also access to energy sources with minimal negative impact on the environment is a scarcity unless a big mining corporation manages to get their hands on it.\n\nSo while Bitcoin mining has its own benefits, some of the industry’s older stakeholders might drop out as they cannot keep up with the demands.\n\nBitcoin Halving: A Recurring Event Shaping the Future\n\nBitcoin halving is a recurring event that plays a critical role in the Bitcoin network. It reduces the block reward received by miners, controls the rate of new Bitcoin creation, and influences various aspects of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The history of halving events showcases the evolution of Bitcoin and its growing significance in the financial world.

This annual event attracts the who’s who of the digital asset mining industry, including top players, enthusiastic investors and Bitcoin advocates alike.\n\nIn my capacity as Executive Chairman of HIVE Digital Technologies, I was excited to shed light on our company’s involvement in the great digital transformation and expansion into the realm of artificial intelligence (AI) and Web3 applications. You can read about HIVE’s long-term plans here.\n\nUndeterred Optimism Amid The Ongoing Bitcoin Bear Market\n\nMy fellow presenters and attendees were all incredibly bullish on Bitcoin, despite the ongoing bear market that has seen the digital asset retreat from its all-time high of nearly $69,000 in November 2021.\n\nThe conference coincided with Bitcoin crossing a significant milestone: the successful mining of the 800,000th block. This landmark event teases the upcoming fourth Bitcoin halving event, projected to happen when block 840,000 is mined in less than nine months from now. The halving process, which occurs approximately every four years, cuts the rewards for Bitcoin miners in half, thereby limiting new supply and creating scarcity.\n\nHistorically, every new cycle has resulted in a fresh, record-high price for Bitcoin. This phenomenon is attributed to the realization among investors that the asset’s supply is capped at 21 million coins, a factor that could spur the price to visit new highs.\n\nBitcoin In Need Of Regulatory Clarity\n\nMany presenters and panelists at the conference centered their message on the need for regulatory clarity in the mining space. Among the most esteemed speakers was Dennis Porter, co-founder and CEO of the Satoshi Action Fund, whose mission is to educate legislators and policymakers across the U.S. on Bitcoin’s varied benefits.\n\nDuring his presentation, Dennis drew interesting parallels between Bitcoin and the cannabis industry, both of which have had to lobby for state-level acceptance and legislation, even as they continue to face federal-level restrictions. He touted his group’s success in getting Montana and Arkansas to pass the Right to Mine law, which protects Bitcoin miners and prohibits energy producers from imposing discriminatory rates on them. The Fund was also instrumental in moving the Texas legislature to kill a proposed anti-mining bill.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also participated at Mining Disrupt via Zoom, representing one of four current candidates who expressly support Bitcoin-friendly policies, the others being entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, Florida governor Ron DeSantis and Miami mayor Francis Suarez, who opts to take his mayoral salary in Bitcoin.\n\nKennedy, who recently disclosed purchasing two bitcoins for each of his seven children, reaffirmed his intention to back the U.S. dollar with Bitcoin and exempt the asset from capital gains taxes if elected president, saying that such exemptions should primarily benefit small investors and businesses.\n\nA Legislative Milestone For Digital Assets?\n\nMeanwhile, in Washington, a bipartisan bill that aims to provide a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies was advanced by a key congressional committee last week. This legislation, endorsed by the House Financial Services Committee, was in response to last year’s sudden collapses of several crypto firms, including Celsius and Voyager. It defines a cryptocurrency’s status as either a security or a commodity, expands the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC) oversight of the industry and clarifies the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) jurisdiction.\n\nDespite some opposition, the bill received support from committee Republicans and some Democrats, marking a major legislative moment for the digital asset sector.\n\nMake no mistake, the bill has been met with opposition, primarily from Rep. Maxine Waters, the leading Democrat on the Financial Services Committee, who believes the bill would cause confusion and reduce protections for consumers and investors. Similar concerns have been raised in the Democratic-led Senate.\n\nHowever, many in the crypto industry remain optimistic, asserting that with bipartisan support, the bill could stand a chance in the Senate. The debate continues over whether these assets should be treated as securities or commodities, highlighting the need for regulatory clarity in this evolving sector.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs And Their Potential Approval\n\nI also want to highlight the possibility of a spot Bitcoin ETF being approved in the U.S. At the Mining Disrupt conference, there was guarded optimism that this may happen soon, following repeated rejections in the past. I believe a spot ETF would be a significant catalyst for Bitcoi...'}]

The Securities and Exchange Commission is required to give a thumbs up or thumbs down to ARK\'s application for a bitcoin ETF by Aug. 13. Eight other organizations, including BlackRock, Bitwise, VanEck, and WisdomTree, have also filed applications for a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nYes, no or punt?\n\nArk\'s application for a spot bitcoin ETF was published in the Federal Register on May 15. A June 15 filing in the Federal Register from the SEC designated Aug. 13 "as the date by which the Commission shall either approve or disapprove, or institute proceedings to determine whether to disapprove, the proposed rule change." However, the SEC can extend the deadline to a maximum of 240 days. At its maximum, the SEC could theoretically delay a final response until Jan. 10, 2024 for the Ark application, and until March 2024 for the others, according to Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management, which has an application in front of the SEC.

Approvals would be simultaneous Given the "first mover" advantage would be tremendous, many are now arguing that if a bitcoin ETF is ultimately approved by the SEC, all the applications should be approved at once. That\'s exactly what Grayscale said in a recent letter to the SEC. "[T]he SEC\'s actions related to bitcoin ETFs should be made in a fair and orderly manner." the letter said. "As a disclosure-based regulator, the SEC should not pick winners and losers."\n\n\'Surveillance sharing agreement\'\n\nThe SEC has denied all prior spot bitcoin ETF applications, citing fraud and manipulation in the underlying markets. It has approved bitcoin ETF futures. The current crop of applications have a new wrinkle: a "surveillance sharing" agreement with exchanges like Nasdaq and Cboe.\n\nwatch now\n\nThis would allow for the sharing of information about market trading activity, clearing activity, and customer identification, which would reduce the chances for market manipulation. It would also seek to ensure that investor assets cannot be diverted by the exchange to an unauthorized party, which was an issue with FTX. It\'s not clear if these changes would be sufficient to cause the SEC to approve a spot bitcoin ETF. The SEC has reportedly said the new applications were inadequate, and exchanges have been scrambling to update their filings to address the SEC\'s concerns.\n\nForcing the SEC\'s hand\n\nMany believe that the SEC will not move unless it is forced to do so. Supporters of a spot bitcoin ETF have been emboldened by a court case unfolding between Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and the SEC. Grayscale has sued the SEC over its refusal to allow the trust to convert to a bitcoin ETF. The SEC cited familiar concerns over market manipulation. During hearings on the case in March, a panel of judges in the D.C. Court of Appeals in Washington pressed the SEC on why it had denied the application, noting that the commission had previously approved bitcoin futures agreements which also had surveillance agreements in them. "It seems like it\'s fine for an agency to say OK, we need some more information, but it seems there\'s quite a bit of information here on how these markets work together, and the SEC has not offered any explanation ... that the petitioners here are wrong," Judge Neomi Rao said. Bitcoin supporters have been cheering Graycale\'s efforts. "They\'re forcing the SEC through a legal process, to provide clarity," Purpose Investments CEO Som Seif told me. Seif runs the Purpose Bitcoin ETF, a spot bitcoin ETF that has been trading in Canada since February, 2021. "I think that that\'s a really important thing, because through the regulatory and legal process, they will be forced to actually give very specific reasons and actually back those reasons... [SEC Chairman Gary Gensler] is going to keep kicking the can down the road until he\'s otherwise forced to say, \'Here\'s why.\'"\n\nGaming the odds\n\nWhile many in the crypto community are putting on a game face, others are doubtful, noting that Gensler seems implacably opposed to approving a spot bitcoin ETF. "We\'re not going to see a spot bitcoin ETF any time soon," Ric Edelman, founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professional (DACFP), told CNBC at a recent conference. "We would love a bitcoin ETF," Edelman said. "It\'s the simplest, easiest, cheapest, most liquid affordable way to invest in bitcoin. But the SEC has rejected every Bitcoin E...'}, {'id': 6, 'time': 'Mon, 07 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Cathie Wood on Bitcoin ETF, Tesla and China Market - Bloomberg', 'content': "00:00\n\nYou know, you are also involved in you've got your own filing for physical physically backed Bitcoin ETF. Do you think that the excitement there has driven up prices across crypto? I mean, today is a down day, but we're still looking at $29,000 for Bitcoin. Yes, I do think that in June, when BlackRock announced its filing or when it was announced that BlackRock had filed for a Bitcoin ETF, the Bitcoin price did shoot up and but has been fairly stable since then. So I do think it's had an impact, A bigger impact this year was the regional bank crisis. It was very interesting to watch Bitcoin go from 19000 to 30000 right in the middle of that banking crisis as regional banks were going bankrupt. So it was a flight to safety. So I thought that move was just as interesting on a flight to safety. Is buying Bitcoin somehow a flight to safety? Isn't it a little too volatile for that? Well, if you think about it, Bitcoin serves as two kinds of hedges. One is a hedge against inflation and outright confiscation of wealth. The other is against counterparty risk. And I, you know, was when the regional banks started going down this fear sort of, you know, memory. Our memories are fresh with oh eight or nine. The counterparty risk became real. And so there was this flight into Bitcoin, a completely decentralized, transparent network which is not subject to counterparty risk. Kathy So you are in this race. Let's talk about the race a little bit. The first important deadline coming up is August 13th, where the Ark filing the SC is either going to delay it, which we think they'll probably delay it. And then BlackRock is later. You filed before BlackRock but BlackRock came in with the surveillance sharing agreement with Coinbase that was novel. Right now we're looking in the future there's talk of a common clock where the SCC could approve a whole bunch of ETFs at once, putting you on a level playing field with BlackRock and others. What's your take on how this will play out given you filed earlier? I think you're probably right that August 13th will come and go and I think I think the SCC, if it's going to approve a Bitcoin ETF, will approve more than one at once. So then again, because most of these essentially will be the same and it will come down to marketing, communicating the message. You know, we've been putting out our Bitcoin monthly for the for the last year. We are now starting a Bitcoin brainstorming session. Our first one we launched last Thursday. So we're trying to get the word out there that, you know, our research is deep and we've been doing it since 2015 when we gained our first exposure to BTC. We were the first public asset manager to gain exposure to Bitcoin at all in 2015. That's exactly where I want to go. The grayscale Bitcoin trust known by its ticker gbtc. If you look at our W, for example, your ARK next generation Internet ETF. Right now I see GBTC as the third largest holding. If we are in a situation where the SEC does give its blessing for a spot Bitcoin ETF, would you plan to sell out of gbtc and buy one of these physically backed funds? So I cannot talk about what we would and would not do. And in fact, our compliance team is, you know, giving us marching orders not to talk very much about this filing and its aftermath at all. So just the fact that we filed with our partner 21 shares is is as far as I can go. So sorry, Katie. Fair enough. No. I was expecting something along those lines. I am curious to get your take on the regulatory temperature right now, because in addition to this rush of spot Bitcoin ETF filings that we've seen, there's also been sort of a race that's unfolding for an ETHER futures ETF. There's been a ton of filings to that effect and not specific to those funds. But do you sense that the mood, mood music around the SEC and what their appetite to allow these products to launch has changed in the last several months? Well, I think that that the two other branches of government, the judicial branch and the legislative branch are giving the FCC pause because the FCC is losing cases in court having to do with its regulations. Around crypto. That's the first thing. And there are bills that are making their way through the House and are seeing some bipartisan support. So I do believe that. Gary Gensler, I guess last week or ten days ago said something like, Well, you know, I'm not the only one who makes this decision. There are five commissioners. Now, of course, we know they're weighted towards the Democrats, two Democrats, two Republicans. And so one assumes that the way that Gary votes is the way that the FCC will vote. But he seemed to be distancing himself a little bit. And so maybe we can take that as a bit of a clue. We definitely did. We thought that was a good sign. But, you know, we're reading all kinds of tea leaves in this. Let me ask you about Coinbase, because you have increased your position in Coinbase. It's also who your surveillance sharing agreement i..."}]

It's been the genius of Bitcoin when it goes up and all of a sudden Larry showed up at the door to say, Hey, big, respectable firms can prosecute and do Bitcoin. Link Lawrence Fink of BlackRock to Mike Novogratz. Well, what's happened is people, as you suggest, make fun of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. But now the establishment of Larry Fink at BlackRock is now saying they're going to have an ETF if approved by the government in Bitcoin. So you're saying, wait a second, the mighty BlackRock is willing to have an ETF in Bitcoin. Maybe Bitcoin is going to be around for a while. Lisa wants to jump in here, but I'm going to cut to the news moment. Is Carlyle announcing this morning a Bitcoin advocacy? No, I don't think so. But there's no doubt that Bitcoin is something that I wish I had bought it at $100 a bitcoin when Mike Novogratz started buying, it's now at $29,000. So he's made a lot of money and a lot of people who bought it at $100 or less are feeling pretty good now. It went up as high as 61,000, I think even down to 31,000 or even 29,000. Now, there's still a pretty good profit if you're bought in 100. We all wish we would have bought it at 100 and to write it up. It's one thing for BlackRock to come up with an ETF because they believe the proposition of Bitcoin. It's another because they see a profitability proposition where they can, you know, basically take advantage of the interest other people have. I mean, isn't that more of what this is that basically Wall Street is saying if there is a market for it and we can viably make one for them and make some money, why not? Well, remember, Wall Street is in business to make money and this is something they can probably make money off. You have to remember, the United States government has been somewhat skeptical of it. I think Democrats in the Congress and particularly the people regulating the FCC are skeptical of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. But outside the United States, there's a lot of interest in it. I think FCX really hurt when it went bankrupt and it hurt the the crypto industry. But a lot of people around the world want to be able to trade in a currency that their government can't know what they have and they want to be at a moving around, rightly or wrongly. And so I don't think Bitcoin is going away. I think the Republicans on Capitol Hill have been pretty supportive of it. There's a difference between having a seamless cross-currency payment, basically saying that instead of going to Western Union, I can go and just transfer something in Bitcoin if it has a stable enough price. That's one proposition. But the proposition of Bitcoin as a store of value, that could kind of be bid up the way that gold or silver could seems to have been sparked with the advent of yield suddenly that you can get for actual money. I mean, isn't that sort of the feeling that you're getting? Well, there's no doubt that when when interest rates are as high as they are, you don't need to have gold or other kinds of things to get you some solid return, because when you get 5% on Treasuries, but eventually 5% will be coming down at some point. I don't think Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies that are the better ones, the better known ones, Bitcoin. And so a number of others are going to go away. There's enormous interest around the world in being able to have something you can transfer without the government knowing about it and keep it private. And you know, you can say, well, people shouldn't do that, but that's not going to stop people from doing it. Mr. Novogratz And Mr. Gensler, what did he say about the efforts of our chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, who's the chairman of the SEC, is not a big fan of cryptocurrencies. I think that's fair to say. But he lost a major case recently in court where he was trying to argue that one of the cryptocurrencies ripple was was a security and he lost that case. So I think the SEC has not been able to convince these the government yet, or at least the courts that cryptocurrency is such a dangerous thing. And I remember a lot of people in the government now are thinking that Gary Gensler won't be the chairman of the SEC for ever going to go. I mean, these guys just wait them out, right? I think that's a strategy that's very popular in Washington, waiting out regulators who don't like."}, {'id': 9, 'time': 'Tue, 08 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Bitcoin, Ether slip as long term holders continue to accumulate BTC - Yahoo Finance', 'content': 'Bitcoin and Ether fell during Tuesday afternoon trading in Hong Kong, along with most of the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.

Despite struggling to rally higher in recent weeks, industry experts say that Bitcoin’s accumulation remains robust among long-term holders.\n\n“What we see today is very similar to this stage of previous cycles – an absence of speculative activity and intense accumulation with coins moving to high conviction, sticky hands – with more in cold storage than ever before,” wrote Jamie Coutts, a senior market structure analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, to Forkast.\n\n“The metrics we track that encapsulate asset-accumulation behavior have never been more robust. Nearly 75% of the issued supply is held in wallets where the coins haven’t moved for more than six months. And for the first time, there are now over 1 million “whole Bitcoiners” – people owning at least 1 full BTC.”\n\nIn the crypto market, Ether rose 0.21% during afternoon trading in Asia to US$1,828 and declined 0.36% during the past week.\n\nDogecoin was the day’s biggest loser in the top 10, after it fell 1.54% in the past 24 hours to US$0.07352, followed by Polkadot’s DOT token that declined 0.57% to US$4.96.\n\nLeading the winners, the XRP coin rose 1.05% to US$0.6203, followed by Solana’s SOL token that gained 0.68% to US$23.24\n\nTotal crypto market capitalization over the past 24 hours rose 0.21% to US$1.16 trillion while market volume increased 42.48% to US$32.32 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nStory continues\n\nPayPal’s stablecoin lifts NFT sales on Ethereum, top NFT blockchains\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index rose 0.69% to 2,476.83 points in the 24 hours to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong but fell 1.3% during the week.\n\nBitcoin’s 24-hour non-fungible token sales continued yesterday’s decline, falling 14.92% to US$365,955 with the network slipping to the eighth largest blockchain by 24-hour NFT sales volume, according to CryptoSlam.\n\nEthereum’s 24-hour NFT sales recovered after yesterday’s slump, rising 19.43% to US$8.05 million, while sales for the largest Ethereum-native NFT collection, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, declined 10.40% to US$563,891.

The cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin and Ether, experienced mixed movements as Bitcoin hovered near $29,560 and Ether rose slightly to $1,828. Bitcoin's price saw a 3% uptick towards $30,000 due to a plunge in global long-dated government bond yields triggered by weak Chinese economic data. Despite Bitcoin's recent price action, long-term holders continue to accumulate the asset, indicating robust accumulation behavior. Additionally, PayPal's stablecoin announcement has lifted NFT sales on Ethereum, suggesting growing interest in cryptocurrencies.

"I think they\'re likely to extend this until the final review."\n\nHougan noted there have been a series of positive indicators for the fund\'s approval, such as surveillance-sharing agreements between exchanges and custodians, a more regulated and robust bitcoin futures market, and a better understanding of crypto custody and broker transfer.\n\n"The totality of circumstances is what the SEC is looking at," Hougan said.

"There\'s no single person in charge of it, it\'s globally distributed. There are no insiders, all the information is public. And that\'s what makes it clearly a commodity."\n\nBut as you go from bitcoin to Ethereum and other assets, Hougan said, the degree of centralized control increases and the question will eventually get more complex, an obstacle he believes legislation will solve.\n\n"You have the two largest regulators disagreeing on whether most crypto assets are securities or commodities," Hougan added, referring to past classification efforts between the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n\n"The right solution there is for legislators to come through and make that clear so that U.S. innovators can win in the market."\n\nBesides Ark, eight other organizations including Hougan\'s firm, Bitwise, have filed applications for a spot bitcoin ETF. Grayscale has also filed to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into a spot fund.\n\nShould the SEC move forward with the approval process, he said the best outcome for investors would be the approval of multiple products.\n\n"I think there should be a fair playing field that allows us to have multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs that compete in the market," Hougan said. "It will allow prices to be the lowest, it will allow competition to be the highest, [and] it will allow service to be the highest."\n\nDisclaimer'}]

*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing volatility with fluctuating fees, transaction volume, and total value transferred. The increasing total size used and unique addresses indicate growing interest and adoption of ETH, but the alternating MACD signal suggests uncertainty in the market trend. The news analyst report, on the other hand, highlights positive developments in the cryptocurrency market, such as increased competition in the crypto ATM sector and investor interest in blockchain technology.

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a balanced approach considering both on-chain data and news reports is crucial for navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. Long-term trends, upcoming events, and strategic risk management should be prioritized over short-term fluctuations to achieve sustainable success in ETH trading. Therefore, a slightly conservative trading approach may be warranted to manage risk effectively and maximize profits over time.

Considering the synthesized reports and the emphasis on long-term strategies, I would take a slightly conservative approach and assign a trading action of 0.3. This reflects my confidence in the market trend being positive in the long term, but also acknowledges the current uncertainty and volatility in the market. By balancing risk management with potential gains, I aim to maximize overall profit in my ETH trading activities.

The SEC has previously rejected several spot Bitcoin ETF applications; however, several bitcoin ETFs based on futures contracts already exist.\n\n\n\nThe Ark21Shares Bitcoin ETF would track the performance of bitcoin as measured by the S&P Bitcoin Index, which uses data from several crypto exchanges.

Additionally, Wood predicted several spot bitcoin ETFs would eventually be approved simultaneously.\n\nAll Eyes on Blackrock's Bitcoin ETF Application\n\nA slew of spot bitcoin ETF proposals were made in June after Blackrock (BLK) entered the fray for the first time with their proposal. Many market commentators saw BlackRock's entry into the spot bitcoin ETF market as a sign that approval from the SEC could be around the corner due to their pivotal role in the U.S. financial system.\n\nEarlier this week, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz claimed his contacts at BlackRock indicated they expected approval on their spot bitcoin ETF proposal within six months.\n\nWhile the SEC has taken a more critical approach to the crypto industry this year, bitcoin has mostly remained immune to the crackdown, as it is the only crypto asset that current chair Gary Gensler has clearly stated is not a security."}]

The delay in the SEC's decision on the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF, along with the request for more public comments, indicates a cautious approach towards approving spot Bitcoin ETFs. This delay could potentially push the decision into 2024, impacting the market sentiment and creating uncertainty among investors. However, the entry of major players like BlackRock into the spot Bitcoin ETF market and the positive legal developments for the crypto industry suggest a growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies. The market trend may see fluctuations in the short term due to regulatory uncertainties, but the long-term outlook for the crypto industry appears positive with potential approval of multiple Bitcoin ETFs.

"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain, news, and reflection analyst reports, it is clear that the market trend for ETH is currently influenced by a mix of factors. The on-chain data indicates a slightly bearish sentiment due to decreases in total value transferred and total transactions, despite buy signals from the MACD.

This includes the Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) of the United States. This time around, the NFP data is expected to cause a dip in the value of BTC.\n\nUS NFP: Forecasting an increase\n\nThe forecasts regarding the November figures of the Nonfarm Payrolls are currently at 180,000, marking an increase from October’s 150,000. This would mean that the unemployment rate would remain unchanged at 3.9%.\n\nThe NFP report has proven to have a considerable impact on the crypto prices, just as it has on other investment classes. Strong jobs reports, i.e. increase in jobs, tend to strengthen the dollar as the increase is a sign of a stronger economy. This has a negative impact on stocks, commodities, etc, and since crypto happens to share a positive correlation with the share market, particularly BTC, it faces correction.\n\nConversely, a weak NFP report proves to provide a bullish outlook for crypto since a lower-than-expected increase in jobs weakens the US Dollar, causing a rally for stock and other markets.\n\nFurthermore, in the event the NFP figures are stronger than expected, the Federal Reserve tends to keep the interest rates high. This is done in order to tighten the monetary policy to control inflation. Thus, even if the Fed doesn't increase the rates in the next meeting, they might keep it stable at 5.25% to 5.50%.\n\nConsequently, Bitcoin price will most likely face correction; however, given the bullish developments in the stock markets, including the potential spot BTC ETF approvals coming soon, the decline may not be excessive.\n\nBitcoin price to note a dip\n\nBitcoin price is presently trading at $43,241 after failing to breach $44,500, resulting in minor corrections. While at the time of writing, the broader market outlook is bullish, the short-term picture is slightly leaning toward bearish.\n\nThis is evinced by the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator.

These arguments often show the variety of viewpoints within the crypto community since fervent believers drive them on all sides.\n\nDogecoin founder, who isn’t one to hold back when airing his opinions, has once again criticized the advertising tactics and overarching stories that Bitcoin advocates champion.\n\nIn the brief video , Robert Breedlove, a BTC maximalist, was seen speaking with Jason Lowery, who continued praising Bitcoin. According to Lowery, BTC is not a coin; rather, it is the future of conflict, security, and those who want to protect their data.\n\nMaximalists of Bitcoin: A Better Attitude Toward Other Cryptos\n\nBitcoin (BTC) maximalists, often known as “Bitcoin Maxis,” are ardent proponents of the cryptocurrency and firmly think that it is superior to all others. They frequently minimize or even reject the worth and potential of other tokens in the wide crypto ecosystem because of their steadfast faith in Bitcoin.\n\nMarkus cited an occasion where a BTC enthusiast was advocating the cryptocurrency in an effort to shed insight on the thinking of these Bitcoiners.\n\nThe enthusiast extended an invitation to others to join the “mentally ill group of insecure losers.” Such utterances offer a window into the frequently divisive opinions of some inside the crypto community.\n\nBitcoin maximalists frequently disparage competing cryptocurrencies using the nickname “s-coins.” The person who most exemplifies this approach is Max Keiser, a well-known member of the Bitcoin community.\n\nHe once requested that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) order major cryptocurrency exchanges to cease operations, referring to them as little more than casinos. Keiser’s ideas, which are similar to those of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, extend to classifying all altcoins as securities.\n\nNotably, Keiser had vehemently asserted that XRP was bound for failure and that it was Gensler’s obligation to ensure its demise before Judge Analisa Torres determined that XRP was not a security in July. These stories have influenced the SEC’s recent activities as the organization has increased its examination of the top cryptocurrencies.\n\nMarkus Questions the Future of Bitcoin\n\nThe most recent criticism from Markus was in response to a video published by Udi Wertheimer, a crypto Twitter user. Interviewing Jason Lowery was Bitcoin maximalist Robert Breedlove in the video. Lowery complimented Bitcoin and emphasized its unmatched potential throughout the interview.\n\nHe continued by saying that Bitcoin is more than just a coin. Instead, he characterized it as security, the future of warfare, and a guarantee for people who want to keep their data private.\n\nman bitcoiners are the literal worst at marketing “come join our clearly mentally ill group of insecure losers!” — Shibetoshi Nakamoto (@BillyM2k) August 12, 2023\n\nMarkus, though, appears to have a strong problem with the content of the video based on his comments. Dogecoin founder’s answer, therefore, supports the idea that innovation is not just restricted to Bitcoin. In the cryptocurrency sector, several additional coins and protocols provide distinctive solutions and show great promise.\n\nNot the First Time Markus Takes a Jab on BTC\n\nIn April this year, Markus criticized Bitcoin as a currency, claiming there isn’t enough for everyone.\n\nThe inventor of the most well-known memecoin on the market recently took to Twitter to criticize cryptocurrency and non-fungible token (NFT) investors, claiming that doing so amounts to investing in mental illness.\n\ninvesting in crypto is literally just investing in mental illness which i suppose is on the rise, so… — Shibetoshi Nakamoto (@BillyM2k) April 22, 2023\n\nThe world is getting dumber and sadder by the day, said Markus, adding that “investing in cryptocurrencies is literally investing in a mental illness, which I assume is on the rise.”\n\nMarkus then claimed that since non-fungible tokens (NFT) are a derivative of cryptocurrencies, investing in them causes people to become “even more mentally ill” when challenged about doing so.\n\nMarkus responded to criticism of his restrictions by saying he was disgusted by the investors who, in his view, quarrel, behave erratically, and make poor choices as a result of an issue with the brain.\n\nAllegedly Owns Very Little DOGE\n\nThe Dogecoin creator’s remarks have been provoking a flood of criticism from irate investors, who claimed that Markus was merely venting his rage at not being able to become wealthy with cryptocurre...'}, {'id': 2, 'time': 'Sat, 12 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'When cryptomining comes to town: High electricity use spillovers to the local economy - CEPR', 'content': 'High energy use is increasingly a feature of many technology processing industries, including quantum computing, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and cryptocurrency mining (‘cryptomining’). Estimates suggest that technology processing passed the milestone of consuming 1% of world energy in 2010 and is on trajectory to increase to 6% by 2030 (Masanet et al. 2020, Andrae and Edler 2015). In recent years, data centres and Bitcoin mining alone consumed 0.9% and 0.5% of global electricity, respectively (Andrae 2017, Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance).\n\nThis intensive electricity consumption results in two negative externalities. The first is the carbon emissions resulting from electricity production of cryptomining, with the website Digiconomist estimating that the global CO2 emissions from Bitcoin mining alone are equivalent to those of Libya (see also De Vries 2018, Blandin et al. 2020).\n\nOur work concerns a second, unstudied externality – the real effects of technology processing on local economies (Benetton et al. 2023). What, for example, are the spillovers from cryptomining on households and small businesses? How does the interaction of supply and demand impact prices and delivery of electricity to homes and small businesses? As we shall see below, cryptomining also has positive externalities in that cryptomines produce local tax revenues, raising questions about net costs and benefits.\n\nBefore describing our methodology and findings, a brief note about cryptomining, which is the clearing of payment transactions for decentralised blockchain-based cryptocurrencies that rely on the ‘proof-of-work’ protocol. Any person or firm can become a cryptominer, which involves solving increasingly complex computational puzzles to verify the validity of transactions. This has led to an arms race among firms who run large cryptomines, essentially warehouses full of specialized computers, crunching numbers across the world. And the key point here is that these cryptomines need lots of electricity, while employing very few people.\n\nA tale of two channels\n\nWe analyse the negative externalities of the high electricity use of cryptomining through two channels: prices and quantity rationing.\n\nChannel #1: Analysing negative externalities via prices\n\nIn the first case, we study New York State, specifically Upstate NY, excluding New York City and Long Island, which was an early market for cryptomining in the US due to its cold climate, cheap electricity, and proximity to large hydropower sources (see Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Bitcoin prices and electricity consumption\n\nNote: This Figure shows monthly electricity consumption for businesses in the town of Plattsburgh, NY, and the neighbouring town of Peru. Before the end of 2017, Plattsburgh and Peru experienced a similar pattern in electricity consumption for businesses. However, in January 2018, when the Bitcoin price peaked, electricity consumption by Plattsburgh businesses increased by almost 150%, whereas almost no change to the seasonal pattern occurred in Peru. The blue line shows the average price of Bitcoin each month. The red dash-dot line and the green dash line show total electricity consumption by small and industrial businesses in Plattsburgh and Peru, respectively. We normalise electricity consumption in each town to 100 in December 2017, which is the month in which Bitcoin prices reached their maximum of around $15,000. Gray areas denote December, January and February of 2016-2017 and 2017-2018.\n\nThe region’s grid operator employs a marginal supply pricing algorithm, whereby upward pressure on prices from demand gets passed to all users, including households and small businesses. We combine detailed data on these local electricity prices, electricity usage, and other economic outcomes with hand-collected data on the likely location of cryptominers, to analyse whether and how the use of electricity by cryptominers affects local communities.\n\nOur findings include the following:\n\nWhen Bitcoin prices are high, the returns from cryptomining are higher in expectation since the reward to miners is paid in Bitcoins. Thus, a higher Bitcoin price increases the demand for electricity by cryptominers.\n\nThere is a statistically significant, negative price elasticity of demand for electricity by the local communities, meaning that as the price of electricity rises, demand falls. These higher prices also lead to larger surpluses for electricity producers.\n\nThere is a positive and significant effect of cryptomining on tax generation. Treated communities experience a relative increase in taxes per capita by $6 compared to control communities when the price of Bitcoin increases by 100%. To put these numbers in perspective, the price of Bitcoin increased from about $600 in 2016 to $7,500 in 2018, which could have led to higher taxes per capita in cryptomining communities by about $70, or 14% of the average tax revenue per capita.\n\nCryptomining leads the average ...'}]

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing volatility with fluctuating fees, transaction volume, and total value transferred. The increasing total size used and unique addresses indicate growing interest and adoption of ETH, but the alternating MACD signal suggests uncertainty in the market trend. The news analyst report, on the other hand, highlights positive developments in the cryptocurrency market, such as increased competition in the crypto ATM sector and investor interest in blockchain technology.

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a balanced approach considering both on-chain data and news reports is crucial for navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. Long-term trends, upcoming events, and strategic risk management should be prioritized over short-term fluctuations to achieve sustainable success in ETH trading. Therefore, a slightly conservative trading approach may be warranted to manage risk effectively and maximize profits over time.

Considering the synthesized reports and the emphasis on long-term strategies, I would take a slightly conservative approach and assign a trading action of 0.3. This reflects my confidence in the market trend being positive in the long term, but also acknowledges the current uncertainty and volatility in the market. By balancing risk management with potential gains, I aim to maximize overall profit in my ETH trading activities.
ACTION:

DAILY RETURN:
-0.0008535797796632716
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing fluctuations in price and transaction data, with no clear direction in the short term. The mixed market sentiment indicated by the MACD signal suggests uncertainty among traders. Additionally, the news analyst report highlights regulatory uncertainties surrounding Bitcoin ETF approvals, which could impact market sentiment and create short-term fluctuations.

Reflecting on the balanced approach mentioned in the reflection analyst report, it is evident that considering both on-chain data and news reports is crucial in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. Prioritizing long-term trends and strategic risk management has been effective in maximizing profits. However, given the current market environment with regulatory uncertainties and short-term fluctuations, a slightly conservative trading approach may be warranted to mitigate risk and capitalize on potential long-term gains.

In conclusion, the overall market trend for ETH appears uncertain in the short term due to regulatory uncertainties and mixed market sentiment. Therefore, a long-term strategy focusing on monitoring key indicators, managing risk, and balancing aggressive and conservative approaches is essential for sustainable profits in ETH trading.

Based on the synthesized reports and the emphasis on a slightly conservative approach, I would take a trading action with a confidence level of 0.3, reflecting a cautious stance in the current market environment.

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently bearish, with indicators such as fluctuating fees, total value transferred, and MACD signal suggesting a potential downward movement. The news analyst report further supports this view by highlighting potential challenges and uncertainties in the broader cryptocurrency market, which could contribute to volatility in ETH prices. 

However, the reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a balanced approach, considering both on-chain data and news reports, to navigate the volatile market successfully. It suggests prioritizing long-term trends, upcoming events, and strategic risk management to capitalize on potential gains while being prepared to adapt to market uncertainties.

Taking into account the synthesized reports, it is advisable to adopt a slightly conservative trading approach to mitigate risk and capitalize on potential long-term gains. While short-term fluctuations and uncertainties may pose challenges, focusing on long-term strategies and risk management is key to navigating the current market environment.

Therefore, considering the bearish market trend and the emphasis on long-term strategies, I would take a cautious approach and decide to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.7. This decision reflects my belief in the downward movement of the market and my strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.

This suggests that selling positions or waiting for a more favorable entry point may be prudent. The news analyst report further adds to the cautious sentiment, highlighting regulatory uncertainties and market challenges that could impact trading behavior.

Reflecting on the past trading performance, a balanced approach considering both on-chain data and news reports has been effective in navigating the volatile market.

In conclusion, the overall market trend for ETH appears to be bearish in the short term due to the downward trend, regulatory uncertainties, and market challenges. Therefore, a slightly conservative trading approach focusing on long-term gains and strategic risk management is recommended. 

Considering the current market conditions and the need for caution, I would take a trading action with a confidence level of 0.2, indicating a slight inclination towards selling ETH to manage risk appropriately in the face of potential market volatility and uncertainties.

Despite pledges to reduce carbon emissions and acknowledgement that climate risks are investment risks, BlackRock is investing in dirty Bitcoin without acknowledging its energy intensity or carbon emissions. This is bad news for the planet.\n\nIn June 2023, BlackRock applied for an exchange-traded fund (ETF) tied to the price of Bitcoin. This first-of-its-kind product made headlines and was followed by a spike in the price of bitcoin.\n\nAn ETF is basically a way for investors to bet on Bitcoin’s value without having to actually buy and hold bitcoin, which can be tricky as well as risky. A Bitcoin ETF managed by a large company like BlackRock could attract many more mainstream investors. But the potential profits for BlackRock and investors would come at a sharp cost to the climate and the rest of society. When Bitcoin’s price and trading volume goes up, so does its energy consumption and carbon emissions. With Bitcoin’s annual carbon emissions already at the scale of a mid-sized industrial country, the world simply can’t afford to support Bitcoin’s price growth.\n\nBlackRock’s ETF proposal builds on other products and services the company offers that enable investing in Bitcoin. In 2022, the company launched a private bitcoin trust that would let institutional investors bet on the price of Bitcoin. This was part of a larger effort to make it more convenient for investors to manage Bitcoin alongside their standard portfolios of stocks and bonds. BlackRock partnered with Coinbase, the crypto exchange company, to integrate Bitcoin into the Coinbases popular investment management platform called Aladdin which would let clients track their bitcoin holdings and trade bitcoin via Coinbase’s exchange.\n\nBlackRock is also putting some of its massive assets into Bitcoin mining companies – the facilities that create Bitcoin’s large carbon footprint. Greenpeace USA research finds that BlackRock controls nearly $600 million worth of shares in Bitcoin mining companies and has shares in most of the large publicly traded miners. These investments are vital for mining companies to access funding for their energy-intensive facilities. For example, BlackRock controlled over 28 million shares valued at $300 million in Riot Platforms, which owns the most energy-intensive U.S. crypto mine in Rockdale, Texas that uses as much electricity as the nearest 300,000 homes. And nearly all that energy is supplied by fossil fuels.\n\nBlackRock also has ties to Bitcoin miners keeping dirty coal power plants alive. The company owns $2.8 million worth of bonds in Marathon Digital whose mining facility helped keep the coal-fired Hardin Generating Station in Hardin, MT operating past its planned closure in 2018. In 2021, this led to 755,700 tons of CO2 emissions and local air pollution with 304 tons of sulfur dioxide and 245 tons of nitrogen oxides. BlackRock also controls a nearly 6% share in Greenidge Generation Holdings, a company that converted a closed coal plant to fossil gas in upstate New York to power a Bitcoin mine. Regulators and the public have scrutinized the facility for its pollution.\n\nAnd when mining companies struggle financially, BlackRock has helped them stay afloat. When Core Scientific filed for bankruptcy in 2022, BlackRock joined a group of creditors that lent the company around $500 million, chipping in $38 million, and contributing another $17 million loan to help Core Scientific operate during bankruptcy.\n\nYet, BlackRock could turn its resources, expertise, and clout towards transforming Bitcoin and mobilizing stakeholders to work on innovative solutions that slash Bitcoin’s carbon footprint while maintaining its key features. Cryptocurrencies don’t have to use massive amounts of electricity. Most don’t, and they can change. Now is the time for BlackRock to acknowledge Bitcoin’s pollution and help solve the problem.'}, {'id': 11, 'time': 'Mon, 14 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Bitcoin trading sideways; NFT transactions soar; Nvidia leads Wall Street rally - Yahoo Finance', 'content': 'Bitcoin edged higher on Tuesday morning in Asia but failed to breach the US$29,500 resistance level.

The world’s leading cryptocurrency reached a high of US$29,660.25 early Tuesday morning.\n\nBitcoin’s price has remained largely within the $29,000 to $30,600 range for the past seven weeks, causing frustration among investors seeking higher rewards. However, low volatility could be a blessing in disguise, Nigel Green, founder and chief executive officer of financial management group deVere, said in an emailed statement.\n\n“This newfound stability attracts institutional investors, who have been historically wary of entering the market due to its extreme price swings,” Green said.\n\n“This stability is also a boon for businesses and consumers looking for a reliable store of value or medium of exchange,” he added.\n\nMatteo Greco, research analyst at Canada-based digital asset investment firm Fineqia International, said in an emailed note that low volatility does not necessarily mean low investor interest in the coin.\n\nGreco pointed to the Bitcoin long-term holder level — a metric that measures the percentage of Bitcoin holders who have held the coin for over 155 days —which reached its highest ever level over the first week of August.\n\nStory continues\n\n“The data shows how the vast majority of BTC holders did not execute trades in the last few months, as the low volumes and the almost inexistent volatility recorded in the last two months suggest,” said Greco.\n\n“These numbers are also typical to be observed during the summer months, especially July and August, and do not reflect a decrease in investors’ interest towards the digital asset market,” he added.\n\nMeanwhile, digital asset investment products saw an inflow of US$29 million in the week ending August 11. That followed three consecutive weeks of outflows totalling around US$144 million, according to a Monday report by European alternative asset manager CoinShares. Bitcoin saw an inflow of US$27 million — roughly 93% of the total inflows.\n\nThe inflows to digital asset investment products are “likely due to the recent U.S. inflation data, which was slightly below expectations, signifying that a September rate hike is less likely,” CoinShares wrote in the report.\n\nAlong with Bitcoin, Ether gained 0.22% to US$1,844.14 and added 1.05% for the past seven days.

The delay in the SEC's decision on the ARK 21Shares spot bitcoin ETF and concerns over BlackRock's Bitcoin investments impacting the environment may create some uncertainty. However, the stability in Bitcoin's price could attract institutional investors, potentially leading to increased market participation. Overall, the market trend may see some volatility in the short term but could stabilize as institutional interest grows and NFT transactions continue to rise.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing fluctuations in price and transaction data, with no clear direction in the short term. The mixed market sentiment indicated by the MACD signal suggests uncertainty among traders. Additionally, the news analyst report highlights regulatory uncertainties surrounding Bitcoin ETF approvals, which could impact market sentiment and create short-term fluctuations.

Reflecting on the balanced approach mentioned in the reflection analyst report, it is evident that considering both on-chain data and news reports is crucial in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. Prioritizing long-term trends and strategic risk management has been effective in maximizing profits. However, given the current market environment with regulatory uncertainties and short-term fluctuations, a slightly conservative trading approach may be warranted to mitigate risk and capitalize on potential long-term gains.

In conclusion, the overall market trend for ETH appears uncertain in the short term due to regulatory uncertainties and mixed market sentiment. Therefore, a long-term strategy focusing on monitoring key indicators, managing risk, and balancing aggressive and conservative approaches is essential for sustainable profits in ETH trading.

Based on the synthesized reports and the emphasis on a slightly conservative approach, I would take a trading action with a confidence level of 0.3, reflecting a cautious stance in the current market environment.
ACTION:

DAILY RETURN:
0.0005716821789603088
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently bearish, with indicators such as fluctuating fees, total value transferred, and MACD signal suggesting a potential downward movement. The news analyst report further supports this view by highlighting potential challenges and uncertainties in the broader cryptocurrency market, which could contribute to volatility in ETH prices. 

However, the reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a balanced approach, considering both on-chain data and news reports, to navigate the volatile market successfully. It suggests prioritizing long-term trends, upcoming events, and strategic risk management to capitalize on potential gains while being prepared to adapt to market uncertainties.

Taking into account the synthesized reports, it is advisable to adopt a slightly conservative trading approach to mitigate risk and capitalize on potential long-term gains. While short-term fluctuations and uncertainties may pose challenges, focusing on long-term strategies and risk management is key to navigating the current market environment.

Therefore, considering the bearish market trend and the emphasis on long-term strategies, I would take a cautious approach and decide to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.7. This decision reflects my belief in the downward movement of the market and my strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.
ACTION:
-0.7
DAILY RETURN:
-0.0042041628808009435
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market has been on a downward trend with fluctuating open prices and a sell signal indicated by the MACD. This suggests that selling positions or waiting for a more favorable entry point may be prudent. The news analyst report further adds to the cautious sentiment, highlighting regulatory uncertainties and market challenges that could impact trading behavior.

Reflecting on the past trading performance, a balanced approach considering both on-chain data and news reports has been effective in navigating the volatile market. Prioritizing long-term trends, strategic risk management, and a slightly conservative trading approach have led to successful outcomes. However, selling during a bearish trend resulted in a loss of profit, emphasizing the importance of a cautious approach.

In conclusion, the overall market trend for ETH appears to be bearish in the short term due to the downward trend, regulatory uncertainties, and market challenges. Therefore, a slightly conservative trading approach focusing on long-term gains and strategic risk management is recommended. 

Considering the current market conditions and the need for caution, I would take a trading action with a confidence level of 0.2, indicating a slight inclination towards selling ETH to manage risk appropriately in the face of potential market volatility and uncertainties.

Although he began these purchases with the bitcoin price at around $10,000, the price had reached more than $30,000 by August 2022, roughly where the price sits at the time of this writing. Many of the firm’s largest purchases were at the higher end of this premium, and Saylor resigned from his position as CEO that same month as MicroStrategy reported a $1 billion loss related to a bitcoin price slump.\n\nAfter Saylor’s resignation, poor performance from bitcoin turned worse as the cryptocurrency exchange FTX cratered in spectacular fashion in November 2022. Through the rest of the year, the bitcoin price remained at around half of what it was when Saylor and MicroStrategy made many of its purchases. However, rising from these lows, the cryptocurrency rose dramatically and consistently throughout 2023 until seeming to generally recover from this valley.\n\nOne year on from his departure from leading MicroStrategy, it seems that Saylor’s persistence is bearing fruit. Although he resigned from his position as CEO, responsible for day-to-day management and operations of his company, he did retain a role as executive chairman of its board, leading the company’s shareholders and representing the firm publicly. With a focus on continuing the firm’s bitcoin strategy, Saylor continued buying thousands of bitcoin at reduced prices, and his commitment seems to be paying off.\n\nIn a recent tweet, Saylor noted MicroStrategy’s 254% increase in stock price since the beginning of his strategy, comparing it to the stock prices of firms like Google and Apple, which rose 78% and 74%, respectively. The decision to publicly tie MicroStrategy’s fortune to bitcoin has, at least for now, led to gains unrelated to the firm’s core products and offerings. This month, the company revealed a plan to sell $750 million of its stock, ostensibly to make further large purchases of bitcoin, and its value rose when the news broke.\n\nSaylor’s work with Bitcoin has gone beyond this high-profile advocacy, as he has taken to development work on the Lightning Network in the past year as well. More than anything, these displays of conviction have shown that his commitment to Bitcoin’s economic vision are genuine, rather than based merely on the dollar price at any given time.\n\nThis decision to wholeheartedly back Bitcoin has seemingly turned into a durable business strategy, capable of weathering and surmounting significant tempests in the global economy.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.'}, {'id': 40, 'time': 'Tue, 15 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Bitcoin, Ether dip amid low volatility; Solana gains - Yahoo Finance', 'content': 'Bitcoin traded flat on Tuesday afternoon in Asia to stay range bound above the US$29,000 support level.

However, low volatility could prove to be a blessing in disguise, said Nigel Green, founder and chief executive officer of financial management group deVere, in an emailed statement.\n\n“This newfound stability attracts institutional investors, who have been historically wary of entering the market due to its extreme price swings,” Green said.\n\n“This stability is also a boon for businesses and consumers looking for a reliable store of value or medium of exchange,” he added.\n\nStory continues\n\nDigital asset investment products saw an inflow of US$29 million in the week ending Aug. 11.

However, selling during a bearish trend resulted in a loss of profit, highlighting the importance of timing and market sentiment.

Moving forward, it may be prudent to adopt a slightly conservative trading approach to manage risk appropriately and capitalize on long-term gains, while also being mindful of short-term market fluctuations and uncertainties. Balancing caution with strategic risk management will be crucial in navigating the evolving cryptocurrency market landscape.

*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the market trend for ETH is bearish, with indicators pointing towards potential further downward movement. The news analyst report, on the other hand, suggests a cautiously optimistic sentiment in the overall cryptocurrency market, with specific cryptocurrencies like Solana showing growth potential. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a balanced approach, strategic risk management, and a slightly conservative trading strategy in navigating the volatile market.

Synthesizing these reports, it is clear that while short-term market fluctuations and uncertainties exist, a long-term approach focusing on strategic risk management and capitalizing on potential growth opportunities is crucial. The bearish trend in the ETH market should be approached with caution, and opportunities in other cryptocurrencies like Solana and the NFT sector should be considered.

Considering the overall market sentiment and the importance of long-term strategies, I would take a slightly conservative approach and opt to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.3. This decision reflects a cautious stance towards the bearish trend in the ETH market and a strategic move to manage risk appropriately while keeping an eye on potential growth opportunities in other sectors of the cryptocurrency market.

The recent news articles indicate a mixed sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, particularly focusing on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). While Bitcoin's volatility has decreased, its price has been fluctuating around the $29,000 level, with potential support at $29,000 and $28,750 and resistance at $29,600 and $30,000. Ethereum has also experienced a slight decline, trading below $1,850. The market cap of Bitcoin has decreased, and Binance's closure of its cryptocurrency payment service has added to the negative sentiment. However, positive news such as Coinbase receiving approval to offer crypto futures to U.S. retail investors may provide some support. Overall, the market trend appears to be cautious with potential downward pressure on prices, especially for altcoins like Dogecoin, Solana, and Ripple. Traders should monitor key levels for potential trends and adjust their strategies accordingly.

"""
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market has been on a downward trend with fluctuating open prices and a sell signal indicated by the MACD. This suggests that selling positions or waiting for a more favorable entry point may be prudent. The news analyst report further adds to the cautious sentiment, highlighting regulatory uncertainties and market challenges that could impact trading behavior.

Reflecting on the past trading performance, a balanced approach considering both on-chain data and news reports has been effective in navigating the volatile market.

However, selling during a bearish trend resulted in a loss of profit, emphasizing the importance of a cautious approach.

In conclusion, the overall market trend for ETH appears to be bearish in the short term due to the downward trend, regulatory uncertainties, and market challenges. Therefore, a slightly conservative trading approach focusing on long-term gains and strategic risk management is recommended.

Ethereum has also experienced a slight decline, trading below $1,850. The market cap of Bitcoin has decreased, and Binance's closure of its cryptocurrency payment service has added to the negative sentiment. However, positive news such as Coinbase receiving approval to offer crypto futures to U.S. retail investors may provide some support. Overall, the market trend appears to be cautious with potential downward pressure on prices, especially for altcoins like Dogecoin, Solana, and Ripple. Traders should monitor key levels for potential trends and adjust their strategies accordingly.

Reflecting on recent trading performance, a balanced approach considering on-chain data, news reports, and strategic risk management has been effective in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. Prioritizing long-term trends and being slightly conservative in trading decisions has led to successful outcomes, while selling during a bearish trend resulted in a loss of profit. Key trends to consider in the current market include the bearish trend in ETH, potential growth opportunities in other cryptocurrencies like Solana, and the rise of NFT transactions. Given the market uncertainties and volatility, a slightly conservative trading approach focusing on long-term gains and strategic risk management is recommended to manage risk appropriately and capitalize on potential growth opportunities.

*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the ETH market is currently experiencing a bearish trend in the short term, as indicated by the decreasing open price, low network usage, and sell signal from the MACD. The news analyst report further supports this sentiment, highlighting mixed market conditions with potential downward pressure on prices, especially for altcoins like Ethereum. However, positive news such as Coinbase's approval to offer crypto futures may provide some support.

Taking into account the reflection analyst report, which emphasizes a balanced approach, strategic risk management, and prioritizing long-term trends, it is clear that a conservative trading strategy focusing on long-term gains is recommended in the current market environment. This approach aligns with the cautious market sentiment and the need to manage risk appropriately amidst market uncertainties and volatility.

Considering all the reports and the current market conditions, I would recommend a conservative trading action with a confidence level of 0.3. This reflects a cautious approach to trading ETH, prioritizing long-term gains and strategic risk management over short-term gains in the bearish market. By adopting this approach, traders can navigate the volatile market conditions effectively and capitalize on potential growth opportunities while managing risk appropriately.

"The current speculation is it\'s an Elon Musk/SpaceX-driven selloff." He noted that this latest dramatic decline is "short-sighted and largely retail-driven."\n\nIn 2022, Tesla, which Musk also leads as CEO, announced that it sold about 75% of its bitcoin holdings after investing $1.5 billion in the flagship cryptocurrency.'}, {'id': 10, 'time': 'Thu, 17 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'BlackRock Shakes Up the Bitcoin ETF Race - Bloomberg', 'content': "Browse all episodes\n\nBlackRock Shakes Up the Bitcoin ETF Race\n\nCrypto fanatics have been pining for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund for a decade now.

But with the entrance of BlackRock Inc. into the race, many market watchers are hopeful that one or more spot-Bitcoin ETFs will finally get the go-ahead. After all, the world’s largest asset manager has a strong track record of getting funds past regulatory roadblocks. On this week’s episode of the What Goes Up podcast, Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart from Bloomberg Intelligence join to discuss how BlackRock’s application dramatically changes the outlook for Bitcoin ETFs. “When they filed, it was a whole different ballgame in my opinion,” says Balchunas. “The fact is they generally like to bring a gun to a knife fight.

In reaction, the stock market fell for a second straight day Wednesday and the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield hit its highest close since 2008.\n\nBitcoin was last lower by about 4% at $27,901.60, according to Coin Metrics. The slide began after the minutes of the Federal Reserve\'s July policy meeting were released Wednesday. Earlier Thursday, it fell to $27,858.94, its lowest level since June 20.\n\nCryptocurrencies were under pressure Thursday as investors grappled with renewed concerns about the U.S. economy.\n\nBitcoin\'s correlation with stocks is at its lowest level in two years, according to Coin Metrics, but in 2022 it shot to an all-time high in response to the Fed\'s rate-hiking campaign to tame inflation.\n\n"Although inflation in itself could be an argument for growth in crypto assets, with inflation comes other aspects like risk off appetite from investors fearing a recession, and avoiding what bitcoin is deemed to be, riskier assets," said Sylvia Jablonski, chief investment officer at Defiance ETFs.\n\n"My suspicion is that the higher beta equities and crypto are the victims of the end of summer lag, range-bound trading, no volume, which is typical in August — with the hawkish Fed as the cherry on top to keep investors to the side and prices in this tight range," Jablonski said.\n\nBitcoin and ether\'s 90-day volatility dropped to multiyear lows at 35% and 37% this week, respectively, according to Kaiko.\n\nNeedham\'s John Todaro added that bitcoin\'s move back to $30,000 in late June "had been on light volume so that rally has not had a ton of strength."

In spite of moves in other assets, the price of bitcoin has remained within a tight trading range over the past two months.\n\nMusk is regarded as one of the crypto market’s biggest cheerleaders and lifted the prices of alternative coins when he mentioned them on his X social media platform. His electric-car company Tesla briefly flirted with accepting payment in the cryptocurrency in 2021 and also ploughed $1.5bn of its own cash into the tokens.\n\nBut bitcoin registered a sharp reversal when Musk abandoned the plans three months later. Since then, the value of the carmaker’s own holdings has fluctuated. Tesla last year recorded $204mn in impairment losses related to its bitcoin holdings.\n\n“History shows that the market often reacts sharply to Elon Musk’s actions, implying that this latest revelation could further dampen investor sentiment,” said James Butterfill, head of research at Coinshares, an investment group.\n\nLow trading volumes and decreased volatility also had an impact, he said, as it “made the market susceptible to larger trades”.\n\nLiquidity and activity in crypto markets have dried up this year as US regulators have cracked down on illicit activity and charged some of the market’s biggest names, including Binance and Coinbase, with violating federal markets laws.\n\nIllustrating the thin liquidity, yesterday it would have taken the sale of 463 bitcoins — worth about $12mn — to push the price of the coin down by one per cent of its prevailing market value, according to CCData, an industry information provider.\n\n\n\nIn March, when crypto markets were convulsed by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, it would have taken the sale of 856 bitcoins, then roughly equivalent to $17mn, to move the price of the token by more than 1 per cent.\n\nIn June the SEC filed lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase, claiming they had broken the law by selling digital tokens to members of the public without filing the required registrations.

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
The recent news articles suggest that Bitcoin has experienced a significant decline in value, falling to almost a two-month low due to various factors such as rising government bond yields, concerns about inflation, and reports of SpaceX selling its bitcoin holdings. The market sentiment appears to be bearish as investors grapple with uncertainties surrounding interest rates, regulatory crackdowns, and the impact of high-profile figures like Elon Musk on the cryptocurrency market. This downward trend in Bitcoin's price may also be affecting other cryptocurrencies, leading to a broader market pullback. As an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst, it is important to closely monitor these developments and consider the potential impact on ETH prices, as market volatility and negative sentiment in the cryptocurrency space could influence trading patterns and investment decisions.

REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently bearish, with a downward trend in prices and a sell indication from the MACD signal. The news analyst report provides a more mixed sentiment, with potential for volatility in the short term but also hints at institutional interest growing in the market. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a balanced approach, strategic risk management, and a slightly conservative trading strategy in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market.

Synthesizing these reports, it is evident that while there may be short-term volatility and uncertainty in the market, a long-term approach focusing on strategic risk management and capitalizing on opportunities is recommended. Institutional interest and the rise in NFT transactions could potentially stabilize the market in the long run.

Considering the overall market trend and the importance of a conservative trading approach, I would take a slightly bearish stance and sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.3.

Since the beginning of 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission has charged 17 different crypto actors with violating securities laws, including several exchanges that allow investors to trade digital currencies as well as individual issuers of digital tokens.\n\nThe SEC’s core assertion in many of these cases is that cryptocurrencies are securities, and therefore should be registered with the agency.\n\nThe courts thus far have not been clear on how digital currencies should be treated.\n\nAnalisa Torres, a US judge in the Southern District of New York, said on July 13 that a digital token issued by Ripple Labs was a security only when it was sold to institutional investors, and not when it was purchased by the general public. The SEC had also sued Ripple for selling unregistered securities.\n\nThen July 31, US judge Jed Rakoff disagreed with that specific view in his case, in which the SEC has alleged stablecoin issuer Terraform Labs sold unregistered securities.\n\nThe SEC is expected to file its motion to appeal the ruling by Torres as early as today.\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance'}, {'id': 16, 'time': 'Fri, 18 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Stocks today: Bitcoin tumbles, options expiration - Yahoo Finance', 'content': "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is continuing to tumble following a selloff that started Thursday afternoon. Meanwhile, options expiration is adding some volatility to the trading day. Yahoo Finance Markets Reporter Jared Blikre breaks down the market action.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n- Bitcoin has recovered slightly after briefly dipping below the $20,000 mark, following reports that Elon Musk's SpaceX had offloaded the cryptocurrency. Another event you need to keep your eye on today, a major options expiry. Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre joins us from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange to really connect the two and break it all down for us. Jared.\n\nJARED BLIKRE: Yeah. I think the big question in crypto is is there a whale selling right now? It would appear so. Bitcoin has been relatively quiet recently. And let's go to the YFi Interactive and chart the recent price action. Here, we can see Bitcoin down 7.44% over the last 24 hours. And here is a three month chart. And I was standing here yesterday afternoon close to the close, just remarking how it had come down to the bottom of this channel.\n\nAnd we were looking for a potential rebound that did not happen. There was just a washout all the way down to about $25,000, which happens to be above the three-month low. Let's take a look at the year to date chart. We had what could be considered a bullish flag here, but that is out the window. We just have more choppiness inside this range. And there are a lot of expectations when Bitcoin first headed north of $30,000 and then again thinking, well, we're going to get some continuation to the upside.\n\nBut there's just huge overhead supply there. And apparently, it was too much for the market. I will show you the high coincided with this overhead supply-- this giant, giant top right here. So still got some things to work through. And now, the onus is on the bears to prove the case because the bulls apparently have given up a little bit. But one of the things I've been tracking this week, and in fact over the last two weeks, has been the fringier parts of the market, including Bitcoin.\n\nStory continues\n\nI'm going to go to my leaders page here on the YFi Interactive. You can see for the day, BITO, that's the Bitcoin ETF. That is down the most, followed by Chinese internet ETF, KWEB. But over the last five days, we've seen meme stocks and Bitcoin really be two of the big losers this week. Why is that? I think because August was expected to be and it has turned out to be a relatively bearish month. We're expecting this to go sideways for the next few months. We also have increasing volatility into September and October.\n\nSo given the gains that we've seen year to date, we were ripe for this situation. The big question is, what happens next? And that kind of leads me into the next topic you mentioned, which was options expiration. What's going on in the options market? Here, I have the S&P 500. You can see we're in the midst of this 5% correction right now. By the way, that's not even-- well that is more than half of the correction we saw due to the regional bank crisis. That was about 9% or so. And we're just looking at 5% right here.\n\nBut you take a look at the VIX. The VIX is picking up. And an analysis by Jefferies out today or yesterday said the pain trade now is decisively to the downside. We saw the Bank of America fund manager survey come out this week, where we saw the least amount of bearishness since February of last year. That was before the Fed kicked off its huge interest rate raising campaign.\n\nAnd so you put all this together, it looks like the bulls have something to prove in this market. And they really haven't for some time. It's been more or less a glide path on the way up. So for substantial correction in a while, we have OpEx this morning. Index options have expired on the open. And now we're waiting until after the close, those last prints of the day, for individual options to expire. There is a lot of put buying, a lot of protection buying coming into this.\n\nPut-to-call ratios, they soared this week. So so much for those zero days to expiration, that phenomenon, and so much for those calls that everybody was buying before. It's all about protection now, guys.\n\n- I'm sure that's what everyone is enthusiastically talking about behind you on the floor here this morning.\n\nJARED BLIKRE: I have no idea what's going on here but--\n\n- I don't know. People are glad it's Friday. I know I am. Maybe that's what's going on. Jared, thank you so much. Appreciate it."}, {'id': 14, 'time': 'Fri, 18 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Could China shut-down the Bitcoin network? | The Crypto Mile - Yahoo Finance', 'content': 'On this week\'s episode of The Crypto Mile, our host Brian McGleenon spoke with Jameson Lopp, a Bitcoin expert and co-founder of the digital asset security firm, Casa. The conversation centred on the longstanding concerns about the concentration of Bitcoin\'s mining hashrate within China. The hashrate is a measure of the amount of computational power that Bitcoin miners are utilising to process transactions and safeguard the network. A higher hashrate value signifies more processor chips are being used to mine new bitcoin and verify transactions on the network. Lopp discussed the potential risk of a "51% attack" if China gained control of over half the global mining power. He discussed the possibility of the Chinese government launching such an attack, which could effectively shut-down the Bitcoin network.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nBRIAN MCGLEENON: Today on "The Crypto Mile," I am joined by Jameson Lopp, respected Bitcoin expert and co-founder of Bitcoin security firm, Casa. Today we\'re going to chat about the significant concentration of Bitcoin mining output within China, and the possibility of a 51% attack on the Bitcoin network emerging from the country. Imagine someone going into a bank and having the power to rewrite whatever figures they wanted in to everyone\'s bank account. Jameson, welcome to this week\'s episode of "The Crypto Mile."\n\nJAMESON LOPP: Glad to be here.\n\nBRIAN MCGLEENON: So Jameson, can you explain to us the present situation for Bitcoin and crypto within China? I thought using Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining were both banned in the country, but that may not be so.\n\nJAMESON LOPP: The general sentiment and agreement seems to be that participating in exchange and trade activities around Bitcoin and crypto seems to be banned. Mining also seems to be banned. The last I heard and my understanding is that it is not outright illegal to actually own Bitcoin, but most of the activities around Bitcoin are considered to be illegal.\n\nStory continues\n\nBRIAN MCGLEENON: OK, so if we\'re talking about Bitcoin mining, that has a connection with the hash rate, and the hash rate is the amount of calculations that go into keeping the consensus mechanism of the blockchain intact. And if the hash power goes up that means more miners are mining to try and acquire new Bitcoin to put onto the network. What is the market share of hash rate that China has at this moment in time?\n\nJAMESON LOPP: Right. It\'s been all over the place. If I recall correctly, I think it peaked in 2019, and there was around 75% of global hash rate in China. Now, in 2021, that\'s when we saw the biggest crackdowns and I think the harshest proclamations by government entities basically saying, you know, you need to stop doing this.\n\nAnd 2021, that summer was actually very interesting because over the span of a few weeks, the total hash rate of the Bitcoin network actually got cut in half. And over the next 6 months, the latter half of 2021, we saw that hash rate come completely back online. And what it seemed to be happening was that a large portion of those miners that were operating in China basically turned off their machines, moved them to other more friendly jurisdictions, turned them back on.\n\nLast I checked at the moment, the United States seems to be doing pretty well. I think probably has around 40% of the global hash rate mainly as a result of our more friendly jurisdictions and having a lot of cheap energy in places like Texas and the Northwest with a lot of hydropower.\n\nBRIAN MCGLEENON: Should we be concerned that China has such-- has this kind of majority of the hash rate?\n\nJAMESON LOPP: Pretty much all of the silicon manufacturing, the actual chips that are used in miners are produced in China. So while, you know, China currently doesn\'t have an overwhelming hash rate, if something changes and it becomes, you know, slightly more friendly again for miners in China, it would not be at all difficult for the hash rate in China to reach new highs.\n\nAnd that\'s just because they have that direct supply. And when it comes to mining, time is money. If you have to ship your hardware to other countries, you know, every day those machines are in transit, you\'re essentially losing potential profit. Could China come back and be a dominant force? Sure. But I think for the same reasons that we haven\'t seen any aberrant activity on the network, even when China had a super majority of hash rate is the same reasons why we wouldn\'t have to worry about that in the future.\n\nAnd it really comes down to incentives. And that really is know why would miners attack the network? That would cause, you know, massive undermining of confidence in the network and it would probably greatly reduce the current value of the Bitcoin holdings of those miners who tend to hold a lot of Bitcoin and also, of course, effect the future potential profits of it.\n\nBRIAN MCGLEENON: It would be very difficult because of that decentralized nature that you spoke about for the Chinese governme...'}]

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
The recent news articles indicate a significant drop in Bitcoin's price, with the cryptocurrency falling below $26,000 and experiencing its worst week since May. The sudden tumble was attributed to factors such as higher interest rates, mass liquidations, and news of Elon Musk's SpaceX selling off bitcoin holdings. Additionally, concerns about China's potential control over Bitcoin's mining hash rate and the possibility of a 51% attack were discussed. These events have led to increased volatility in the crypto market, with investors closely monitoring Bitcoin's ability to stay above key support levels. The market trend appears bearish, with potential further declines in Bitcoin and other risk assets in the coming days and weeks.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the market trend for ETH is bearish, with indicators pointing towards potential further downward movement. The news analyst report, on the other hand, suggests a cautiously optimistic sentiment in the overall cryptocurrency market, with specific cryptocurrencies like Solana showing growth potential. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a balanced approach, strategic risk management, and a slightly conservative trading strategy in navigating the volatile market.

Synthesizing these reports, it is clear that while short-term market fluctuations and uncertainties exist, a long-term approach focusing on strategic risk management and capitalizing on potential growth opportunities is crucial. The bearish trend in the ETH market should be approached with caution, and opportunities in other cryptocurrencies like Solana and the NFT sector should be considered.

Considering the overall market sentiment and the importance of long-term strategies, I would take a slightly conservative approach and opt to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.3. This decision reflects a cautious stance towards the bearish trend in the ETH market and a strategic move to manage risk appropriately while keeping an eye on potential growth opportunities in other sectors of the cryptocurrency market.
ACTION:
-0.3
DAILY RETURN:
-0.0038737302312225053
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the ETH market is currently experiencing a bearish trend in the short term, as indicated by the decreasing open price, low network usage, and sell signal from the MACD. The news analyst report further supports this sentiment, highlighting mixed market conditions with potential downward pressure on prices, especially for altcoins like Ethereum. However, positive news such as Coinbase's approval to offer crypto futures may provide some support.

Taking into account the reflection analyst report, which emphasizes a balanced approach, strategic risk management, and prioritizing long-term trends, it is clear that a conservative trading strategy focusing on long-term gains is recommended in the current market environment. This approach aligns with the cautious market sentiment and the need to manage risk appropriately amidst market uncertainties and volatility.

Considering all the reports and the current market conditions, I would recommend a conservative trading action with a confidence level of 0.3. This reflects a cautious approach to trading ETH, prioritizing long-term gains and strategic risk management over short-term gains in the bearish market. By adopting this approach, traders can navigate the volatile market conditions effectively and capitalize on potential growth opportunities while managing risk appropriately.
ACTION:
0.3
DAILY RETURN:
-0.033255907603275014
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing a bearish trend in the short term, as indicated by the decrease in price and overall trading activity. However, the recent MACD buy signal suggests a potential reversal in the near future. The news analyst report further supports this bearish sentiment, highlighting the negative impact of Bitcoin's decline on the broader cryptocurrency market and the uncertainties surrounding regulatory crackdowns and market sentiment.

In reflection, it is evident that a conservative trading approach focusing on long-term gains and strategic risk management has been more successful in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. Given the current market conditions and potential for short-term fluctuations, it is important to prioritize long-term trends and manage risk effectively.

Therefore, the clear market trend for ETH is bearish in the short term, with potential for a reversal in the near future. To maximize overall profit and mitigate risks, a conservative trading approach is warranted. Considering these factors, I would take a cautious approach and assign a trading action of 0.3, reflecting moderate confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.

The price of bitcoin is down 11% over the past week, trading at levels last seen in mid-June.\n\nThe jump in bond yields has also been weighing on risk assets overall, including crypto.

This week, it was shaken awake. For the past several months, the hallmark volatility that previously attracted hordes of investors to the world’s largest cryptocurrency has been absent, with the rate of its swings reaching its lowest point since 2016.That lull snapped Thursday, when Bitcoin plunged more than 8% in the space of a few hours to a two-month low of $25,314 late in the New York day. The slump sparked a broad decline across all of crypto, leading to more than $1 billion in liquidations and putting Bitcoin on pace for its worst week since November and crypto exchange FTX’s collapse.The carnage — fueled by the prospect of prolonged high interest rates and exacerbated by thin crypto trading — was a reminder of the various threats that continue to stalk digital assets, from hostile regulators to a broader rout in risk assets. And even as Bitcoin has recovered smartly from last year’s lows, many investors are still sitting out, depriving the market of the breadth and depth that are key ingredients for a sustained bull run.“There are still significant amounts of macro uncertainty keeping investors away, and liquidity is still thin,” said Noelle Acheson, author of the “Crypto Is Macro Now” newsletter and former head of market insights at Genesis Trading. “Bottom line, there’s not yet enough conviction.”Thursday’s activity marked another entry in an emerging trendline for Bitcoin in 2023, with the token having already crashed to two similar low points in January and March. But every sharp decline this year has been followed by recovery, said FRNT Financial’s Stephane Oullette.“The next few days should give more clues to whether the selloff will continue and we’ll see a reversal of this year’s trend,” Oullette said in an email on Friday. Signs that Bitcoin is making a major divergence would be if the token were to make a decisive break below the $25,000 mark, he added, or conversely, a sustained push beyond $30,000. Its high for the year was $31,818 in July.Part of the reason behind this week’s plunge was the market’s outsize exposure to larger trades. The last four months have had the lowest average daily volume of spot crypto transactions since October 2020, according to Riyad Carey, a research analyst for blockchain data firm Kaiko. At that time, Bitcoin was worth around $10,000, while the second most popular cryptoasset Ether, now at $1,670, was valued at $350.The sector is also overly reliant on narrative to prop up prices, with hype around crypto’s next buzzy project or a Wall Street firm buying cryptocurrencies among the things that spur on investors. A Wall Street Journal report that Elon Musk’s SpaceX had sold Bitcoin holdings worsened Thursday’s decline.But the narrative is unlikely to improve when these days, many of the biggest announcements to rock the world of digital assets come either from regulators in Washington or judges in the courtroom. The hangover from 2022’s run of bankruptcies and fraud scandals continue to play out on the world stage, dampening optimism on crypto’s recovery.Just this week, former FTX co-founder and alleged fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried was escorted to a Brooklyn penitentiary after his bail deal was revoked by a judge. Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty to the multiple criminal charges he faces.Recent price declines can be partly attributed to US enforcement actions against crypto exchanges, CoinShares’s James Butterfill said in a blog post on Friday, adding that a recent survey saw fund managers rank regulatory decisions as their key concern. The lingering threat of further lawsuits or penalties haunts the market, leaving investors wary of the safety of some of crypto’s top venues.Despite this, Bitcoin has displayed a general resilience over the last few months when compared to global risk assets. Post crash, it’s still up 58.1% so far in 2023 — far higher than the S&P 500’s 13.6% gain. And while Bitcoin is likely to experience further downside if monetary conditions continue to deteriorate, Bloomberg Intelligence’s Jamie Douglas Coutts reckons that hype around a potential US spot crypto ETF may help it maintain that value.BlackRock Inc.’s surprise filing in mid-June for a Bitcoin ETF prompted a flurry of firms to follow suit and led to a mini-rally as investors bet that approval of the funds would spur a wave of fresh buying. And it’s not just Bitcoin. A Bloomberg report late Thursday that the US Securities and Exchange Commission is poised to allow the first ETF based on Ether futures helped to reverse some of the token’s initial plunge — and a confirmed approval will likely cause an Ether bounce that drives up other tokens with it, Acheson said.Still, absent a catalyst like an ETF approval, the market is likely to drift. And unfortunately for traders who thrive on price swings, Friday’s sharp spike in price activity across Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is likely to be short-lived, at leas...'}, {'id': 6, 'time': 'Sat, 19 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Bitcoin casinos and burger joints selling Tether — how Hong Kong fell back in love with crypto - DLNews', 'content': 'Hong Kong introduced new regulations for exchanges in June, following years of uncertainty about crypto.\n\nThat hasn’t stopped the creation of a vibrant crypto culture.\n\nThe metropolis teems with crypto storefronts offering over-the-counter trading in Bitcoin, Ether, and altcoins.\n\nSome days it seems like everyone in Hong Kong has a crypto story.\n\nThe son of the security guard in my apartment block bought three restaurants with money made from Bitcoin investments. I tell a Romanian importer at a bar that I write about crypto and he pulls up the leg of his jeans to reveal a Bitcoin tattoo on his calf. A medical student at Hong Kong University tells me her friends made “so much money” trading tokens — but she knows little about crypto herself.\n\nSigns of Bitcoin and its ilk are, quite literally, everywhere in this metropolis of 7 million. An environmental group advertises its NFT collection on a billboard by the Star Ferry terminal where you cross to Hong Kong Island from Kowloon.\n\nCrypto crazed\n\nThe crypto scene in Hong Kong these days is striking, given the existential levels of angst now rippling through the industry.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nIt’s true, Bitcoin is up more than 60% this year and ETH has jumped 40%, but with US regulators clamping down on the likes of Coinbase and Binance, and DeFi regularly roiled by hacks and heists there’s an unmissable vibe that the revolution is in trouble. So why is Hong Kong so crypto crazed?\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum ATMs still abound in Hong Kong. Photocredit: Shutterstock\n\nHard to say, but the evidence is ample. Walking through Central, the city’s business district, on a Saturday night, there’s a sign by the mid-level escalators for Bitcino, “where Bitcoin meets casino and drinks.”\n\nThe Bored Ape Yacht Club’s ApeFest is coming to Hong Kong later this year. Convenience stores stock an NFT magazine created by local enthusiasts.

You might find the occasional cafe in Singapore with an Azuki on the wall or countries like Thailand that give you NFTs when you visit certain tourist spots, but Hong Kong is next level.\n\nIt’s hard to believe that not too long ago there was a perception that crypto was dead in Hong Kong.\n\nIt’s hard to believe that not too long ago there was a perception that crypto was dead in Hong Kong.\n\nIn 2021, Henri Arslanian, former chair of the FinTech Association of Hong Kong, told The Financial Times that every large crypto company in the city had “already started a contingency plan to relocate their business due to the uncertainty.” He moved his firm, Nine Blocks Capital, to Dubai last year.\n\nThen the Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission announced plans to regulate exchanges. In June, the city launched a task force for promoting web3. Politicians including Johnny Ng are staking their reputations on this being the future in the city.\n\nCreative mashups of Bitcoin and other forms of recreation are plentiful in Hong Kong. Photocredit: Callan Quinn/ DL News\n\nWhy Hong Kong changed its mind about crypto is still not clear. Some put it down to improved understanding among regulators. Some say the government got a case of FOMO as Singapore and Dubai started trying to coax away their companies.\n\nStill others say it’s the guiding hand of Beijing — though, given China’s hard line on crypto, this raises more questions than it answers. Beijing, after all, has banned speculating on tokens and mining Bitcoin.\n\nBut perhaps the strangest thing you may notice in Hong Kong is how many over-the-counter crypto shops there are.\n\n‘Call Me Bitcoin Queen’\n\nForeign exchange outlets on Nathan Road now sit side by side with booths bearing names like Crypto King. The T symbol for Tether hangs at the entrance to Chungking Mansions, a notorious 60-year-old tower block that houses an eclectic collection of hostels, rent-by-the-hour rooms, phone repair shops, currency traders, fake watch sellers, doss houses, and cheap curry kitchens. Now it’s added crypto to its list of amenities.\n\nThe forex and remittance shops are still more popular than their crypto counterparts — one shopkeeper rolls his eyes when I ask about his crypto neighbour — but occasionally a person saunters over to one of the crypto desks.\n\nWant some USDT and fast food?

The decision allowed the SEC to file a motion, on Aug. 18, requesting permission to bring a case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Ripple will also be able to file an opposition to the motion. Torres ruled, on July 13, that Ripple’s XRP token is not a security when distributed in public sales, but the ruling considered XRP a security in institutional sales.

The crypto bloodbath led to billions of dollars worth of hedged positions being liquidated, and several traders lost millions of dollars in a single trade. According to CoinGlass data, a total of 176,752 traders got liquidated within hours, indicating a rapid rise in price volatility just days after BTC and ETH recorded their lowest daily volatility in several years. The price function in the crypto market was attributed to several factors, including the SpaceX Bitcoin write-down and macroeconomic factors.\n\nBitcoin-friendly El Salvador sees bond returns soar to 70% in 2023\n\nEl Salvador, which adopted Bitcoin as a legal tender in 2021, has seen its dollar bond outperform the majority of the emerging markets with a 70% return in 2023. The massive rally of the bond has now drawn interest from several institutional giants, including JP Morgan, Eaton Vance and PGIM Fixed Income, prompting President Nayib Bukele to say, “I told you so.” Apart from the institutional giants, the likes of Lord Abbett & Co LLC, Neuberger Berman Group LLC and UBS Group AG have also added debt security since April. El Salvador paid $800 million in debt in full within the due maturing time at the start of this year, raising confidence in the country’s bonds again.\n\nFirst EU spot Bitcoin ETF hits Euronext Amsterdam exchange\n\nEurope welcomed its first-ever spot Bitcoin ETF after the long-awaited launch of Jacobi Asset Management’s Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the ETH market is currently experiencing a bearish trend in the short term, as indicated by the decreasing open price, low network usage, and sell signal from the MACD. The news analyst report further supports this sentiment, highlighting mixed market conditions with potential downward pressure on prices, especially for altcoins like Ethereum. However, positive news such as Coinbase's approval to offer crypto futures may provide some support.

Taking into account the reflection analyst report, which emphasizes a balanced approach, strategic risk management, and prioritizing long-term trends, it is clear that a conservative trading strategy focusing on long-term gains is recommended in the current market environment. This approach aligns with the cautious market sentiment and the need to manage risk appropriately amidst market uncertainties and volatility.

Considering all the reports and the current market conditions, I would recommend a conservative trading action with a confidence level of 0.3. This reflects a cautious approach to trading ETH, prioritizing long-term gains and strategic risk management over short-term gains in the bearish market. By adopting this approach, traders can navigate the volatile market conditions effectively and capitalize on potential growth opportunities while managing risk appropriately.

DAILY RETURN:
-0.033255907603275014
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing a bearish trend in the short term, as indicated by the decrease in price and overall trading activity. However, the recent MACD buy signal suggests a potential reversal in the near future. The news analyst report further supports this bearish sentiment, highlighting the negative impact of Bitcoin's decline on the broader cryptocurrency market and the uncertainties surrounding regulatory crackdowns and market sentiment.

In reflection, it is evident that a conservative trading approach focusing on long-term gains and strategic risk management has been more successful in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. Given the current market conditions and potential for short-term fluctuations, it is important to prioritize long-term trends and manage risk effectively.

Therefore, the clear market trend for ETH is bearish in the short term, with potential for a reversal in the near future. To maximize overall profit and mitigate risks, a conservative trading approach is warranted. Considering these factors, I would take a cautious approach and assign a trading action of 0.3, reflecting moderate confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.
ACTION:
0.3
DAILY RETURN:
-0.014010033383640375
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is noted that the ETH market has been experiencing a downward trend, but there are signs of a potential bullish reversal with the MACD signal switching from sell to buy. The market activity remains high, indicating potential for a shift in the trend. 

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights the bearish sentiment in the overall crypto market, with Bitcoin experiencing significant drops due to various factors such as higher interest rates and negative news events. This could potentially impact ETH as well, given the correlation between the two cryptocurrencies.

In reflection, it is clear that a conservative trading approach focusing on long-term gains and strategic risk management has been successful in navigating the volatile market conditions. It is important to prioritize long-term trends and manage risk effectively to maximize overall profit.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is advisable to adopt a slightly conservative trading approach and prioritize long-term gains over short-term fluctuations. Therefore, my trading action would be to buy ETH with a confidence level of 0.5, indicating a moderate confidence in the potential bullish reversal in the market while also being cautious of the overall bearish sentiment in the crypto market.

Here's what sparked it, and why that volatility can persist - CNBC", 'content': 'Bitcoin\'s back to its volatile ways after its big move down late last week — but not for the reason investors expected. Volatility has been a defining characteristic of bitcoin in both positive and negative ways, but it\'s been almost completely absent from the market for several weeks. That was, until Thursday night, when the cryptocurrency suddenly tumbled as much as 9% . Aside from the mismanaged crypto lenders (and FTX) that plagued the crypto market in 2022, the Federal Reserve\'s inflation-fighting rate hiking campaign played a big part in bitcoin\'s downward price pressure. Though investors had started to think the Fed was done with rate hikes for the rest of this year, the minutes of the latest FOMC meeting released Wednesday showed central bank sees "upside risks" to inflation that could lead to more increases. That\'s when bitcoin\'s decline really began, and the volatility could linger, according to Mark Connors, head of research at Canadian investment fund manager 3iQ. "The volatility will have a persistence if we\'re going to stay here at an elevated real rate environment," he told CNBC. "We\'re not surprised when we see a stepwise function in yields, 25 basis points in a month to 4.25% on the 10-year – the highest in the long time. Mortgage rates are higher, the next hanging chads to drop is credit risk defaults." BTC.CM= 5D mountain Bitcoin (BTC) began falling after the July FOMC meeting minutes were released Wednesday. Market observers typically monitor where the benchmark fed funds rate is hovering, but "real rates" account for the difference between nominal rates and inflation indicators. Even if the Fed doesn\'t raise interest rates anymore, the crypto space seems more focused now on real rates and keeping them elevated to fight inflation. "These are just normal developments that happen when we\'re stepping into a new rate regime," he said. "This isn\'t like bad behavior from last year. The centralized, unregistered, unregulated bad actors and fraudsters hiding offshore entities – that was last year." A \'healthy bloodletting\' Investors expected volatility would return when regulatory headwinds turned into tailwinds — by seeing an SEC-approved spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund or clear crypto legislation enacted in Congress. That would also usher in the return of liquidity, which left the market after the banking crisis in the spring, and help create a better functioning market. "This is a healthy bloodletting of some of the active trade management and a reminder that we don\'t have liquidity and of why we need regulation," Connors said. "We need to have more active engaged market makers in this space to absorb and provide liquidity with guidance from developed markets like the U.S." Crypto needs regulatory clarity so institutional buyers can own crypto assets, Connors explained, likening the situation to high-yield debt in the 1980s: It\'s still a core holding even though it had its own notorious bad actors that\'ve gone away. "The market and institutions own it. It\'s a stable market because you have long bias market," he said. "If we get clarity … and we get the ability of institutions to just buy … then when you get these downdrafts of 10% or 15%, institutions won\'t rebalance their 1% to 2% holdings in bitcoin against equities, they\'ll add more." "When Bitcoin goes up … there\'ll be selling into people buying it. That\'s a healthy ecosystem," he added. Having institutions with an established long core holding would act as a stabilizing force for Bitcoin, Connors added. But currently, institutions are one the sidelines until they get clarity from regulators on how they can bring crypto into their business. That\'s why this summer\'s bitcoin ETF filings from BlackRock, Fidelity and other institutions are so critical. "Until this gets settled, capital can\'t go into the space to help provide that shock absorption," Connors said. —CNBC\'s Jeff Cox contributed reporting.'}, {'id': 5, 'time': 'Sun, 20 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Empowered files for Ark and 21Shares-branded bitcoin futures ETFs - Financial Times', 'content': 'Print this page\n\nSimply sign up to the Exchange traded funds myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nLatest news on ETFs Visit our ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools\n\nEmpowered Funds has filed to launch three bitcoin futures ETFs that will use the Ark Invest and 21Shares brands in their names.\n\nAlthough the ETFs will use the 21Shares and Ark brands, those two firms will function as the funds’ subadviser and sub-subadviser, respectively.\n\nEmpowered, a subsidiary of Alpha Architect doing business as EA Advisers, will serve as the funds’ adviser.\n\nThe Ark 21Shares Active Bitcoin Futures ETF will invest primarily in bitcoin futures traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.\n\nThis article was previously published by Ignites, a title owned by the FT Group.\n\nThe ETF will also serve as the underlying ETF in two other bitcoin-related ETFs.\n\nThe Ark 21Shares Active On-Chain Bitcoin Strategy ETF will invest at least 25 per cent of its assets in the Digital Asset and Blockchain Strategy ETF, its prospectus shows.\n\nThe on-chain ETF will use a proprietary trend indicator model to adjust its allocation strategy, depending on whether the bitcoin market trend is bullish or bearish.\n\nAccording to the prospectus, under bullish conditions, the ETF can invest 100 per cent of its assets in the underlying ETF.\n\nThis article was previously published by Ignites, a title owned by the FT Group.\n\nUnder bearish conditions, the fund will invest up to 75 per cent of its assets in US Treasury securities, money market instruments and repurchase agreements.\n\nDepending on the model’s trend assessment, the ETF’s investment team will adjust the fund’s exposure to bitcoin futures, the filing shows.\n\nThe ETF’s investment team will lean on the model but will have full discretion in determining the active ETF’s allocation to bitcoin futures.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ark 21Shares Digital Asset and Blockchain Strategy ETF will invest in the underlying ETF along with “investments that provide exposure to digital assets and in companies engaged in the blockchain, digital asset, technology and fintech industry”, its prospectus says.\n\nThat ETF can have up to an 80 per cent allocation to the bitcoin futures ETF or other assets and can invest up to 20 per cent of its assets in cash or cash equivalents, such as Treasuries, and in real estate investment trusts.\n\nFees for the ETFs were not disclosed.\n\n21Shares co-founder and president Ophelia Snyder will serve as portfolio manager on the funds, according to the filings.\n\nArk and 21Shares may be looking to diversify their range of bitcoin ETFs and could be attempting to launch their own futures ETF to use within their other ETF strategies, said Roxanna Islam, associate director of research at VettaFi.\n\n“While current news has revolved around spot bitcoin ETF filings, realistically there may still be a long time to approval,” she said. “It seems that Ark is trying to make use of current resources and continue to expand its current line-up of crypto funds, while keeping its eye on the goal of a spot bitcoin ETF.”\n\nLatest news on ETFs Visit the ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools helping you to understand everything from performance to ESG ratings\n\nThe two managers filed to launch a spot bitcoin ETF in April, but the Securities and Exchange Commission last week postponed its decision on whether to approve the ETF.\n\nArk amended its spot bitcoin ETF filing in June, following a slew of similar filings from large managers such as BlackRock, Fidelity and Invesco.\n\nEmpowered Funds’ parent company Alpha Architect offers 15 ETFs with $1.9bn in assets as of July 31, according to data from Morningstar Direct.\n\nInvestors piled $717mn into those funds in the year to that date.\n\n*Ignites is a news service published by FT Specialist for professionals working in the asset management industry.

It’s noteworthy that current Bitcoin prices have stabilized around levels observed before this announcement,” he added.\n\nThe low volume and volatility in Bitcoin, a rise in U.S. treasury yields, as well as concerns over China’s ailing economy contributed to Bitcoin’s sharp weekly decline, the CoinShares report found.\n\n“The outlook for the markets in the forthcoming months presents a blend of opportunities and challenges. It’s anticipated that the U.S. Federal Reserve will refrain from hiking rates further in September,” Butterfill said.\n\nStory continues\n\nA dovish shift in Fed policy could provide a boost to Bitcoin’s prospects, he added.\n\n“On the flip side, investors are eagerly awaiting the SEC’s verdict on the Grayscale ETF and BlackRock applications in September.

The recent drop in Bitcoin's price was sparked by the Federal Reserve's indication of potential rate hikes to combat inflation, leading to increased volatility in the market. However, despite the drop, Bitcoin and Ether have stabilized, with Bitcoin hovering above the $26,000 support level. The filing of bitcoin futures ETFs by Empowered Funds using the Ark Invest and 21Shares brands could indicate a growing interest in cryptocurrency investments. The potential approval of Ethereum futures-based ETFs by the SEC could further boost market sentiment.

"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing a bearish trend in the short term, as indicated by the decrease in price and overall trading activity. However, the recent MACD buy signal suggests a potential reversal in the near future. The news analyst report further supports this bearish sentiment, highlighting the negative impact of Bitcoin's decline on the broader cryptocurrency market and the uncertainties surrounding regulatory crackdowns and market sentiment.

In reflection, it is evident that a conservative trading approach focusing on long-term gains and strategic risk management has been more successful in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. Given the current market conditions and potential for short-term fluctuations, it is important to prioritize long-term trends and manage risk effectively.

Therefore, the clear market trend for ETH is bearish in the short term, with potential for a reversal in the near future. To maximize overall profit and mitigate risks, a conservative trading approach is warranted. Considering these factors, I would take a cautious approach and assign a trading action of 0.3, reflecting moderate confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.

Yahoo Finance Crypto Reporter David Hollerith explains that eight companies have filed for approval since BlackRock (BLK) did so back in June. Hollerith explains the situation, stating "The SEC has several opportunities from here to either approve, deny or push off approval for these applications." Hollerith notes that many argue that Bitcoin is "not regulated enough and too manipulatable" as reasons for pushback against the potential spot ETF.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, a lot of speculation has surrounded the chances of a Bitcoin spot ETF being approved, given how much scrutiny the sector is feeling from regulators. Let\'s bring in Yahoo Finance\'s David Hollerith to discuss this more. David, we know that-- we\'ve been hearing a lot about the potential for this, but not seeing any companies quite make it to the finish line just yet.\n\nDAVID HOLLERITH: Hey, Rachelle. Since BlackRock\'s filing, which happened earlier this summer, there\'s been eight other companies who\'ve refiled applications to list a spot Bitcoin ETF, and that\'s included ARK Invest, Bitwise, VanEck, WisdomTree, and Invesco.\n\nAnd now, the SEC has several opportunities from here to either approve, deny, or simply push off approval for these applications. They can\'t push off approval after six months from now. That\'s when we\'ll have a definite decision about whether or not the agency would be OK with listing these products.\n\nBut that being said, earlier this month, ARK Invest application was pushed off approval, and the deadline for these other applications from the other asset managers are coming at the beginning of September. And John Reed Stark, who is a former attorney for the SEC\'s enforcement division, weighed in on this at the beginning of-- or excuse me, the end of last week. And he had said, he puts the chances at slim to none.\n\nStory continues\n\nStark, obviously having worked for the agency, does know a lot about the enforcement division, and his thoughts are that the Bitcoin spot market is too-- it\'s a little bit too not regulated enough and a little bit too manipulable, which has been the argument in past years for a why there\'s been no approval.\n\nBut a lot of people have really come out around the BlackRock filing. And Bloomberg\'s ETF team-- Bloomberg Intelligence\'s ETF team, which has been more bullish on the prospects of approval in the coming six months has said, the question is really what could BlackRock know that these other filers didn\'t know at the time?\n\nThey added a surveillance sharing agreement, which has been taken as a new addition to this. And potentially, people have said that might be what will make the change for the SEC to approve it. But at this point, it is still pretty unclear about how things could go. We\'re looking at the Grayscale lawsuit with the SEC, which we\'re expecting a verdict on any week now. And that\'s expected usually on a Tuesday or a Friday is when these verdicts come out.\n\nAnd obviously, Grayscale is trying to convert their GBTC product into an ETF. And that\'s been a long battle. So we could see some more clarity into the SEC\'s thinking with that verdict or at least with what they have to do next, depending on the judge\'s interpretations. But we\'re not expecting it to be a clear path for ETFs either, given that the verdict could mean a few different things.\n\nBut that being said, Bloomberg\'s team, which again, I said, has been a little bit more bullish, has said the odds of a Bitcoin spot ETF, they\'ve placed it at around 65% at this point. So that\'s much better than it was before BlackRock filed for the product.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: I mean, you figure if BlackRock can\'t make it, what chance does some of these smaller companies have indeed? But thank you for getting us up to speed. And we will be taking a look at those enforcement actions as well. Our very own David Hollerith. Thanks so much.'}, {'id': 37, 'time': 'Mon, 21 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Bitcoin recovers after falling below $26,000 as the ETF excitement bubble bursts - Yahoo Finance', 'content': 'Bitcoin stabilized Tuesday morning in Asia after dropping below the key US$26,000 support level overnight. Ether also dipped but held the US$1,600 mark. All other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded flat to lower, with Polygon’s Matic leading the losers. Alternative asset manager CoinShares reported a US$55 million outflow in digital asset investment products last week. Analysts say disappointment from the stalemate on U.S. Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications has impacted sentiment. Meanwhile, the Forkast 500 NFT index continued its downward slide in the wake of NFT marketplace OpenSea’s decision to stop enforcing creator royalties. U.S. stock futures traded lower after Wall Street closed mixed on Monday.\n\nETF logjam and low liquidity damaging sentiment\n\nBitcoin dipped 0.10% in the last 24 hours to US$26,133.35 as of 07:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, expanding its weekly loss of 11.12%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world’s leading cryptocurrency dropped to a low of US$25,846.09 just after midnight, but rallied to reclaim US$26,000 as the night progressed.\n\n“As the beginning of the week turned positive for traditional markets, crypto markets seem to — for now — be back in stagnation mode,” said Justin d’Anethan, head of Asia-Pacific business development at Belgium-based crypto market maker Keyrock.\n\n“Many investors were understandably spooked by last week’s rapid rise in volatility and the subsequent price fall, which now means that a positive mood will only be just enough to keep crypto markets where they are.”\n\nFor some analysts, last week’s rapid decline in the price of Bitcoin is a correction for price increases since June caused by ETF hype in the U.S.\n\n“The recent turmoil led BTC price to trading levels that mirror the ones preceding the Blackrock filing for their BTC Spot ETF,” Matteo Greco, research analyst at Canada-based digital asset investment firm Fineqia International, said in an emailed note.\n\n“The fear-of-missing-out (FOMO) which lasted a few weeks after the filing seems to be now disappeared, waiting for news on the matter,” Greco added.\n\nStory continues\n\nLow liquidity in the crypto market also contributed to last week’s slide. Limited trading volume is driving market makers — which typically absorb sudden fluctuations in supply and demand and help provide a more predictable trading environment — to wind down their activities and wait for a better time to fully resume operations.\n\nGSR Markets, described by Greco as “one of the most important market makers,” has recently gone through two rounds of layoffs in response to worsening market conditions. Greco pointed out that before GSR, influential market makers Jane Street and Jump took similar actions citing difficulties with the state of the market.\n\nAlong with Bitcoin, Ether dropped 0.84% to US$1,667.73 and moved down 9.55% for the past seven days.\n\nAll other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded lower over the past 24 hours. Polygon’s Matic token led the losers. It dropped 3.53% to US$0.5589 for a weekly loss of 17.81%.\n\nDigital asset investment products saw an outflow of US$55 million in the week ending August 18. That followed a US$29 million inflow the previous week, according to a CoinShares report released Monday.\n\n“We believe this is in reaction to recent media highlighting that a decision by the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission in allowing a U.S. spot-based ETF is not imminent,” the company wrote in the report.\n\nBitcoin-linked investment products saw the majority of last week’s outflow, totaling US$42 million. Ethereum, Polygon, Litecoin and Polkadot also recorded outflows, while XRP-linked inflows totaled US$1.2 million.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dipped 0.62% in the past 24 hours to US$1.05 trillion, while trading volume rose 35.31% to US$29.31 billion.\n\nNFT marketplace Recur to shut down\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market.

The cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, experienced a period of instability and decline as rising bond yields and external pressures in China contributed to a sell-off in the market. Bitcoin fell almost 1% to $26,000, while altcoins like Ether, XRP, Solana, Polygon, and Cardano also saw losses. The uncertainty surrounding the approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission further dampened market sentiment.

But Bitcoin mining is extremely energy intensive, requiring powerful computers to run for days on end, solving complex mathematical problems in order to keep the Bitcoin system running. Researchers at the University of Cambridge have found the electricity consumption of the Bitcoin network is roughly equivalent to that of countries like Sweden, Norway, and Pakistan.\n\nAnd while Bitcoin bashers have labelled the digital currency a climate villain, one novel strategy being looked at is using crypto mining as a form of energy storage by converting stranded renewable energy into Bitcoin. Wind and solar energy can be unpredictable, with supply often exceeding immediate demand. As a result, grid-connected renewable energy sources often have to pause operations if they're producing too much energy, energy which can't be stored.\n\nOthers are not as convinced. Regulators in Sweden said even if Bitcoin could run on renewable energy, the country needs those energy sources for essential services. But Bitcoiners contend wind and solar farms are often located in remote locations, and electricity does not transmit efficiently over long distances. Bitcoin mines, however, can be located close to renewable projects.\n\nBitcoin mines could also tap into the wind, solar, and battery projects that are ready to produce energy but are still waiting to be connected to power grids. That's 1,300 gigawatts in the United States alone. Bitcoin is already being used to offset excess energy produced by several global fossil-fuel energy producers. US-based ConocoPhillips is selling stranded gas into Bitcoin miners in the Bakken, an oil-abundant region in the United States, while Exxon has agreed to redirect gas that would otherwise be wasted to mobile Bitcoin mines. TEPCO, Japan's biggest electric power company, is the first major player to send excess renewable energy into Bitcoin mining.\n\nCrypto miners also stand to benefit from arrangements like these, as pressure to lower their energy consumption grows. In 2022, New York State imposed a moratorium on fossil fuel-powered Bitcoin mines, and an ongoing regulatory crackdown on digital assets poses fresh challenges to the industry. Last year, President Biden also signed an executive order on digital assets and said the United States must take strong steps to reduce the risks they create when it comes to climate change and pollution. Another reason why major crypto miners are keen to find greener energy sources for their operations and lower their carbon footprint."}, {'id': 58, 'time': 'Tue, 22 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Crypto plunge gives Indian investors the jitters - The Economic Times', 'content': '\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMumbai: The sudden sell-off in major cryptocurrencies over the past few days has rattled Indian crypto investors, with Bitcoin seeing its most significant weekly drop since the November 2022 FTX crash In the past week, Bitcoin declined 11.5%, hitting $26,023.3, according to CoinGecko\'s data as of 5.30 pm on Monday.

Moreover, large Bitcoin holders selling off their investments in the futures market and China\'s second-largest property developer, China Evergrande, filing for US bankruptcy, added to the uncertainty to the economic landscape."Market sentiments changed very quickly after the Tesla news and then there was a bunch of negative news which just kept adding to the prevailing uncertainty.

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
The recent significant drop in Bitcoin's price below $26,000, the largest weekly decline since the FTX crash in November 2022, has rattled Indian crypto investors and led to a bearish sentiment in the market. The sell-off was exacerbated by factors such as Elon Musk's SpaceX divesting its Bitcoin holdings, concerns over possible interest rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve, and large Bitcoin holders selling off their investments. Additionally, regulatory uncertainty and a 30% tax on crypto earnings enforced by the Indian government have further dampened investor enthusiasm. Despite some inflows into European crypto ETPs following BlackRock's application to launch a Bitcoin fund, the overall market outlook remains bearish, with potential further corrections in Bitcoin's price expected in the short term.

The recent news articles suggest a mixed sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin experiencing a significant gain amid optimism surrounding central banks pausing interest-rate hikes, while Ether faces a risky chart outlook with a 12% decline in August. The overall crypto market bounced back from a recent sell-off, with Bitcoin rising to $26,500 and other tokens like Binance coin, Solana, Cardano, and Polygon also seeing gains.

You are an experienced ETH cryptocurrency trader and you are trying to maximize your overall profit by trading ETH. In each day, you will make an action to buy or sell ETH. You are assisted by a few analysts below and need to decide the final action.

ON-CHAIN ANALYST REPORT:
"""
Based on the recent data, the open price of ETH has been fluctuating around the $26,000 mark, with an average fee ranging from 0.00125 to 0.00168. The total value transferred has also varied, indicating some level of volatility in the market. However, the total size used and unique addresses have remained relatively stable. The number of coinbase transactions and total transactions have shown some fluctuations, but overall, the market seems to be experiencing a bullish trend as indicated by the MACD signal consistently showing a buy signal. This suggests that investors are optimistic about the future price movement of ETH.
"""

NEWS ANALYST REPORT:
"""
The recent news articles suggest a mixed sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin experiencing a significant gain amid optimism surrounding central banks pausing interest-rate hikes, while Ether faces a risky chart outlook with a 12% decline in August. The overall crypto market bounced back from a recent sell-off, with Bitcoin rising to $26,500 and other tokens like Binance coin, Solana, Cardano, and Polygon also seeing gains. Analysts are hopeful for Bitcoin's price to continue its upward trend, especially with potential positive catalysts like the XRP court ruling and upcoming halving event. However, market volatility and concerns about Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech at the Jackson Hole Symposium could impact the market in the short term. Overall, the market trend appears to be cautiously optimistic with potential for further gains in the near future.
