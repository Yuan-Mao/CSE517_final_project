After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that there is a high level of activity on the Ethereum network with a significant amount of value being transferred. However, the MACD signal indicating a sell suggests a potential bearish trend in the market. The news analyst report further supports this bearish sentiment, highlighting a general negative trend in the cryptocurrency market, including potential downward pressure on ETH due to regulatory issues and decreasing trading activity.

Reflecting on my past performance and the current market conditions, it is clear that a more conservative trading approach is necessary to minimize risks and preserve capital. It is crucial to stay informed about key trends and indicators in the market and adapt trading strategies accordingly. Implementing stop-loss orders and proper risk management strategies is essential to protect against potential losses.

In conclusion, the overall market trend appears to be bearish in the short term due to regulatory issues, decreasing trading activity, and the MACD signal indicating a sell. Therefore, a long-term strategy focused on risk management and capital preservation is recommended. 

Based on the synthesized reports and the need for a conservative approach, I would take a trading action of -0.5 to reflect my cautious stance in the current market environment.

[{'id': 5, 'time': 'Sun, 01 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Will Bitcoin Explode in Value? 1 Key Metric to Watch - The Motley Fool', 'content': 'When it comes to Bitcoin (BTC -1.61%), the conventional wisdom is that it is a risky, highly volatile asset prone to sharp price fluctuations. Indeed, for much of its history, Bitcoin has been characterized by very high volatility.\n\nBut that may be changing. Since April, Bitcoin\'s volatility has been on the decline. In fact, it touched historically low levels in late summer. Bitcoin\'s future price trajectory could depend on this metric, so let\'s take a closer look.\n\nBitcoin volatility\n\nBy just about any measure, Bitcoin\'s volatility (i.e., how much Bitcoin\'s price fluctuates within a given time period) is trending down and approaching all-time lows. This first became a phenomenon late last year when crypto traders began to complain that Bitcoin was becoming "boring." Instead of seeing massive price swings daily, the price of Bitcoin seemed to move within a very narrow band. And that same trend has persisted into 2023. If you\'re wondering why Bitcoin has not been able to punch through the $30,000 mark recently or why there\'s little to no movement after major news events, this is the reason.\n\nIn mid-August, a popular Bitcoin volatility index (known as the BVOL) touched a new low, and some crypto analysts were quick to point out the "exhaustion and apathy" for Bitcoin. You can see this on the chart below showing changes in Bitcoin\'s volatility in 2023:\n\nData by TradingView\n\nBut let\'s zoom out for a second and see how the current period stacks up against previous historical evidence. This chart shows Bitcoin\'s volatility since 2016, and it is eye-opening, to say the least. At a glance, you can see how Bitcoin\'s current volatility is clearly at historical lows. Annualized volatility previously approached 100% to 200% during certain periods, and now it\'s around 10%:\n\nData by TradingView\n\nIs this the new norm?\n\nOne view about this extraordinary change to Bitcoin volatility is that this is the new norm. As Bitcoin goes increasingly mainstream and as more institutional investors boost their allocation to crypto, Bitcoin could lose some of its volatility. Quite simply, large institutional investors (think pension funds and university endowments) have much longer investment horizons than speculators and traders, and this should help reduce some of the zigs and zags in Bitcoin\'s price.\n\nThere is some evidence to support this theory beyond just lower volatility figures. For example, the supply of Bitcoin on cryptocurrency exchanges appears to be on the downswing. The basic idea here is that, as more Bitcoin goes off-exchange for secure long-term holding, less Bitcoin can be traded on the major crypto exchanges, and this should reduce volatility.\n\nOr is it the calm before the storm?\n\nHowever, the opposing point of view is that the current period is the proverbial "calm before the storm." Quite simply, this unprecedented period of lower volatility could precede a major spike in volatility as Bitcoin explodes in value. In the past, this has been the pattern with Bitcoin. In two different cases, a prolonged period of relatively low volatility led to Bitcoin skyrocketing in value. Of course, past performance is no guarantee of future performance.\n\nImpact on Bitcoin price targets\n\nVolatility is important because it directly impacts the future price trajectory of Bitcoin. High volatility increases the chances of major price swings, both to the upside and the downside. In short, it\'s what makes huge Bitcoin rallies possible. These rallies draw in speculators and short-term traders, making Bitcoin even more volatile.\n\nThus, when you hear investors suggesting that Bitcoin could soar to $100,000 or skyrocket to $1 million within a very short period, they are likely assuming that Bitcoin\'s volatility will eventually return to its previous levels. This is what enables huge price swings over a relatively short period.\n\nBut what if lower volatility is the new norm? Well, then, the chances of Bitcoin spiking to $100,000 anytime soon are very much limited. At this point, it is still too early to say that Bitcoin\'s volatility is in permanent decline. Crypto has always been a risky, highly volatile asset class, and Bitcoin\'s current volatility could simply be a historical aberration.\n\nBut maybe it\'s not, considering all the new institutional money flowing into Bitcoin. So keep your eye on Bitcoin\'s volatility -- this might end up being one of the biggest factors determining whether or not it can soar in value heading into 2024.'}, {'id': 21, 'time': 'Sun, 01 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'So You Want To Become A Bitcoin Millionaire? - The College Investor', 'content': 'Investing in cryptocurrency and crypto assets is high risk.

Investing in cryptocurrency and crypto assets is high risk. Don’t invest unless you’re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nThere\'s an old aviation joke that asks "How do you make a million dollars in the airline business"? The punchline ("Start with two million dollars") is a bit of hyperbole but there is a kernel of truth to it. Much of the same can be said for investing in Bitcoin and other forms of cryptocurrency. Unless you got in on the ground floor in the early 2010s or get incredibly lucky, you\'re unlikely to make any life-changing amounts of money in cryptocurrency. In this article, we\'ll take a look at Bitcoin, what it means to invest in cryptocurrency and some alternatives that have a better track record of historical success.\n\nWhat Is Bitcoin? Because Bitcoin is the oldest and most popular form of cryptocurrency (introduced in 2009), many people use the two terms interchangeably. But Bitcoin is just one form of cryptocurrency — some other forms are Ethereum, Litecoin or Dogecoin. Cryptocurrency is a form of digital currency that is backed by a form of cryptography often referred to as the blockchain. Because of the way that cryptocurrencies are set up, they are nearly impossible to counterfeit. There are a few ways that you can invest in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. The easiest way to invest in Bitcoin is to simply get a Bitcoin wallet and buy Bitcoins. We recommend Coinbase for U.S. investors – it’s the easiest, links to your bank account, and allows you to buy and sell Bitcoins. Plus, if you open an new account, Coinbase will give you a $5 Bitcoin bonus when you make your first trade! Another way is to If you want to invest in an ETF through your broker, check out the GBTC. This ETF tracks Bitcoin, and you can invest in fractional shares. Another option is mining for Bitcoins, since as long as the markets remain active you can basically make money for nothing. But the problem is, mining is such a tough gig now that it is hardly worth it. Turning your computer into a miner will likely make it noisy and heat up. It would likely take you a long time to even mine a single Bitcoin, by which time you probably would have spent more on electricity. Keep in mind that investing in Bitcoin is incredibly volatile. For almost all people, it is not a good idea to invest the majority of your portfolio in any form of cryptocurrency. If you really want to dabble in crypto investing, set aside a small portion of your investments — only enough that you would be comfortable losing entirely.\n\nWhen You Would Have Needed To Invest in Bitcoin To Be A Millionaire\n\nThe history of Bitcoin is volatile and turbulent. Long gone are the days that you could make a token investment in Bitcoin and become a bitcoin millionaire seemingly overnight. To give you a bit of context:\n\nInvesting $10 in Bitcoin in January 2011 would have turned into $1.2 million by March 2022 .\n\n. You\'d have needed to invest $160 in Bitcoin in January 2012, $440 in January 2013 or $24,000 in January 2014 to have that same amount.\n\n\n\nBy January 2018, you\'d have needed to invest nearly $450,000 in Bitcoin in order to have $1.2 million today.\n\n\n\nOver the last few years, we\'ve seen a smaller and smaller rise in the price of Bitcoin. This doesn\'t mean that there isn\'t money to be made, but gone are the chances you can turn $10 into $1,000,000.\n\nThe "Risks" Of Becoming A Bitcoin Millionaire\n\nEven if you had invested in Bitcoin way back then, it would have taken nerves of steel to hold onto it through the year. Looking at the historical BTC chart, you\'d have had to survive and hold through several periods where your investment lost nearly 50% of its value within the period of a few weeks.\n\nWith hindsight, it\'s easy to say that "it\'s just $10" if that\'s all you invested originally. But would you have been willing to not panic when your Bitcoin portfolio had gotten up near $1M and dropped hundreds of thousands of dollars overnight? Another risk of having all of your money in Bitcoin is finding places that will accept it as payment for goods and services. While it is becoming more and more prevalent to find a business that will accept cryptocurrency as payment, it is still relatively rare. You\'re not likely to be able to get bread and milk from the corner store by paying with crypto. Instead, you\'ll have to change your currency, likely incurring additional fees and taxes.

This shows that the advantage is gradually tilting in favor of the buyers.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bears are trying to stall the rally near $27,500 but the bulls have not given up much ground. This shows that every minor dip is being purchased. This increases the odds of a break above $27,500. The BTC/USDT pair could then retest the crucial overhead resistance at $28,143. This level may again attract aggressive selling by the bears.\n\nIf the price turns down sharply from $28,143, the pair could retest the 20-day exponential moving average ($26,630). A strong bounce off this level could kick the price above $28,143. The pair may subsequently climb to $30,000.\n\nThis bullish view will be negated in the near term if the price turns down and dives below the solid support at $26,000.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 4-hour chart shows that the pair is taking support at the 20-EMA. This indicates that the bulls are trying to take charge. However, the bears are unlikely to give up easily and they will try to halt the recovery in the zone between $27,300 and $27,500. The sellers will then have to yank the price below the 20-EMA to seize control.\n\nConversely, if bulls pierce the overhead resistance at $27,500, it will pave the way for a possible rally to $28,143. This level may witness a tough battle between the buyers and sellers.\n\nMaker price analysis\n\nMaker (MKR) broke and closed above $1,370 on Sep. 26, indicating the start of a new uptrend. When an asset is in an uptrend, traders tend to buy on dips.\n\nMKR/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bears tried to stall the up-move at $1,600 but the bulls purchased the dip at $1,432. This indicates that the sentiment remains positive and lower levels are being bought. If bulls propel the price above $1,600, the MKR/USDT pair could rally to $1,760 and then sprint to $1,909.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the price turns down sharply and skids below $1,432, it could make room for a retest of the breakout level at $1,370. The bears will have to yank the price below this support to indicate that the uptrend may be over.\n\nMKR/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 4-hour chart shows that the bears are fiercely protecting the overhead resistance at $1,600. If bulls want to keep their chances of continuing the uptrend alive, they will have to buy the dips to the 20-EMA.\n\nIf the price snaps back from the 20-EMA, the buyers will once again try to overcome the obstacle at $1,600 and start the next leg of the uptrend. Alternatively, a collapse to $1,432 and then to the 50-simple moving average may begin if the pair drops below the 20-EMA.\n\nAave price analysis\n\nAave (AAVE) is trying to break above the long-term downtrend line, indicating a potential trend change. The rebound off the 20-day EMA ($62.42) on Sep. 28 indicates a change in sentiment from selling on rallies to buying on dips.\n\nAAVE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bears will try to stall the recovery at the downtrend line but if bulls do not allow the price to slip back below the 20-day EMA, it will increase the likelihood of a break above it.

If this level cracks, it will suggest that bears remain active at higher levels. That could pull the price down to the 50-day SMA ($58.82).\n\nAAVE/USDT 4-hour chart.

The news articles suggest that Bitcoin's volatility has been decreasing, potentially indicating a shift towards lower volatility levels as institutional investors enter the market. This could lead to a more stable price trajectory for Bitcoin, limiting the chances of extreme price swings and making it less likely for Bitcoin to reach high price targets in the near future. However, the recent positive monthly close for Bitcoin in September and the historical bullish track record of October could lead to a potential relief rally for Bitcoin, which may also boost interest in altcoins.

The news analyst report further supports this bearish sentiment, highlighting a general negative trend in the cryptocurrency market, including potential downward pressure on ETH due to regulatory issues and decreasing trading activity.

Reflecting on my past performance and the current market conditions, it is clear that a more conservative trading approach is necessary to minimize risks and preserve capital. It is crucial to stay informed about key trends and indicators in the market and adapt trading strategies accordingly. Implementing stop-loss orders and proper risk management strategies is essential to protect against potential losses.

In conclusion, the overall market trend appears to be bearish in the short term due to regulatory issues, decreasing trading activity, and the MACD signal indicating a sell. Therefore, a long-term strategy focused on risk management and capital preservation is recommended. 

Based on the synthesized reports and the need for a conservative approach, I would take a trading action of -0.5 to reflect my cautious stance in the current market environment.

Earlier this year, Babylon published a litepaper outlining its pioneering concept of native trustless Bitcoin staking to secure PoS chains. Recent data from Glassnode’s reinforces the pressing need for such an innovation. A staggering 66% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply, equivalent to 12.26 million BTC, remained dormant for a year. This indicates vast untapped potential, positioning idle Bitcoins to boost the economic security of PoS chains and decentralized applications (dApps) that rely on staking.\n\nBabylon positions itself as the first marketplace to connect the $500B decentralized trust to earn yield for providing security capital. The company was able to gain support from prominent Cosmos chains that are exploring to adopt Babylon’s Bitcoin Staking Protocol. Zaki Manian, co-founder of Sommelier Protocol, said, “For years interactions between bitcoin and the growing web3 application layer have been limited to bridging and swapping. Babylon Bitcoin staking lays the path for consensus layer integration with modular and app chains”.\n\nPoS chains have historically been tethered to their native assets for security. However, as the majority of capital gravitates to established protocols, emerging chains often grapple with limited staked resources, undermining their security. In addition, to attract staking, chains usually have to implement very high inflation to pay for high staking rewards, which affects its token utility and economic health. This has resulted in a fragmented ecosystem where networks are forced to compete for a limited pool of staked capital. Babylon’s Bitcoin Staking Protocol provides a way for PoS chains to stake Bitcoin instead of their native tokens. This allows PoS chains to acquire staking capital from the largest crypto asset in the world and enjoy high security. In addition, since Bitcoin has been serving as a store of value without much yield, using Bitcoin as a staking asset can greatly reduce PoS chain’s inflation pressure.\n\nStory continues\n\n"Babylon\'s protocol doesn\'t just harness these idle bitcoins, it transforms them into a security backbone for PoS chains," said David Tse, Co-founder, Babylon. "Our approach seamlessly integrates Bitcoin staking with almost any PoS protocols in a modular fashion, allowing any bitcoin holder to earn staking rewards from a wide variety of PoS chains. This not only amplifies economic incentives but paves the way for broader adoption, underscoring Bitcoin\'s diverse utility beyond its widely-recognized role as a store of value."\n\nBabylon overcomes the limitations of Bitcoin’s scripting language by amalgamating it with advanced cryptographic techniques. It allows bitcoin holders to lock their bitcoins on the Bitcoin network in a self-custodian way, yet the locked bitcoins can serve as a first-class staking asset for PoS chains with desirable properties such as yield-generation, slashability, and on-demand unstaking. In addition, Babylon\'s Bitcoin staking protocol does not require any soft or hard fork of Bitcoin.\n\nScreenshot of Bitcoin Staking Protocol MVP\n\nScreenshot of Bitcoin Staking Protocol MVP\n\nBabylon MVP showcases the first implementation of this new technology, where bitcoin testnet coins are staked to secure Babylon PoS chain, which will serve as the control plane for other PoS chains to access to the Bitcoin staking protocol. The MVP comes with a modern explorer and a very straightforward web application for bitcoin holders to test Bitcoin staking.\n\nAfter the MVP debut, Babylon will focus on adoption in various ecosystems. This includes the Cosmos ecosystem of blockchains, which is heavily reliant on native staking. Within Cosmos, the top ten protocols boast a combined $2.5 billion worth of staked assets, with an average staking ratio of 50%. Furthermore, 34 integrated PoS chains have shown a strong desire to reduce the 21 day unbonding time for assets staked in Cosmos. Demand for Babylon’s time-stamping protocol was made clear when the Osmosis governance proposal to utilize Bitcoin staking was passed with a 99.9% vote in favor.\n\nThe Company successfully secured a seed funding round, spearheaded by IDG and Breyer Capital—prominent early backers of Coinbase and Circle. With this momentum, the firm is actively seeking additional investment to bolster the advancement of the Bitcoin Staking protocol, among other initiatives.\n\nAbout Babylon\n\nBabylon is a blockchain project that designs security protocols for the decentralized world. Babylon’s origins come from a transformative research paper on Bitcoin security co-authored by Babylon co-founders David ...'}, {'id': 20, 'time': 'Mon, 02 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'FTX customers who lost a fortune on the bankrupt exchange are doubling down on crypto - CNBC', 'content': 'FTX\'s multibillion-dollar cryptocurrency blowup hasn\'t destroyed all faith in the industry. In a new documentary premiering Monday, FTX customers, insiders and investors tell CNBC that despite not receiving a single dollar\'s worth of cryptocurrency back, they\'re optimistic on the industry and plan to keep investing. Evan Luthra, an app developer, entrepreneur and angel investor, told CNBC he lost $2 million in the collapse of FTX. Luthra said he knew when FTX filed for bankruptcy protection in late 2022 that he wouldn\'t have "access to any of this money for the next few years." He continues to speak at crypto conferences.\n\nFTX customer Evan Luthra talked with CNBC in Miami before speaking at a crypto conference. CNBC\n\n"I do want everybody to understand that the mistake here was not bitcoin , the mistake was not crypto," Luthra said. "The fundamental reason why we buy bitcoin, why we use bitcoin has not changed." Luthra said his hefty loss on FTX hasn\'t shaken his bitcoin bullishness. "I know it\'s going to end up at over $100,000 sooner or later anyways, so for me it\'s a great buy," he said. Bitcoin is currently trading at about $26,900, down from a high of about $69,000 in December 2021. "All the success is made in the trenches, not when everybody\'s already celebrating," he said. FTX, once one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, spiraled into bankruptcy after its swift collapse last year. Shortly afterward, FTX investigators said they discovered $8.9 billion in customer assets were missing from the exchange. FTX founder and ex-CEO Sam Bankman-Fried faces seven criminal charges of fraud and campaign finance violations. He pleaded not guilty to all charges. Jury selection begins in New York on Tuesday.\n\nFTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried leaves Manhattan federal court in New York after a court appearance, June 15, 2023. Fatih Aktas | Anadolu Agency | Getty Images\n\nAt a bankruptcy hearing in April 2022, an attorney for FTX said $7.3 billion in cash and liquid crypto assets had been recovered from the exchange. So far, none of the customers interviewed by CNBC have received any of their money back. Jake Thacker, an FTX customer in Portland, Oregon, told CNBC he lost hundreds of thousands of dollars on the exchange shortly after he lost his job in the tech industry. "I\'m in quite a big hole right now," Thacker said. "I\'m probably going to have to file for bankruptcy."\n\nFTX customer Jake Thacker told CNBC he lost hundreds of thousands of dollars on the crypto exchange. CNBC\n\nThacker told CNBC he "would encourage people to still invest in crypto." "I probably would give them some different advice at this point," he said. That advice would come with the warning: "Here\'s what I learned, don\'t make the same mistakes I did." Bhagamshi Kannegundla said he first heard about FTX in an advertisement featuring comedian Larry David that aired during the Super Bowl. "I was like, oh my goodness, there\'s all these big name people utilizing FTX," Kannegundla said. "So I was like, OK, hey, I think I\'ll be safe using this." Less than a year later, Kannegundla said, he was out $174,000, representing around 60% of his crypto portfolio, from FTX\'s collapse.\n\nBhagamshi Kannegundla, an FTX customer, told CNBC he sold his bankruptcy claim to reinvest in crypto. CNBC\n\n"Based on all the other bankruptcies and everything that happened in the crypto market, I was really, really worried about getting anything back, and then how long I would have to wait," Kannegundla said. Instead of waiting for the recoveries to eventually be distributed to FTX customers, Kannegundla went online and found a company that would help him sell his bankruptcy claim for pennies on the dollar to get a little bit of cash more quickly. Kannegundla said his bankruptcy claim was for $174,000. He received around $19,000 in the sale. "The buyer was, after all the due diligence and everything, it went down to like 11% of the $174,000," he said. Years later, if the FTX bankruptcy process recovers more than the 11 cents on the dollar for his claim, the buyer pockets the difference. Kannegundla said he will have "zero regrets" if that money gets recovered because he has a different strategy. "I wanted to get the cash from the bankruptcy claim, primarily to invest in crypto again," he said. "I felt as if there was a good chance for me to make money in the next five to 10 years." Kannegundla said he understands that it may be an odd choice. "People might think I\'m crazy for this," he said. "After going through the FTX and all these other bankruptcies, why would you want to buy any more crypto?" "When you believe in something as far as technology, you will go through it, you know, it\'s kind of like the same person who bought like, let\'s say Amazon stock," he said. Another FTX customer, Sunil Kavuri, who has a background in traditional finance, said he moved his digital assets from rival exchange Binance to FTX because he believed it was a safe place for his money...'}]

Is that kind of what we\'re talking about?" This question, posed by Kevin O\'Leary during a recent discussion at Benzinga\'s Crypto Unlocked event, set the stage for a candid conversation about the future of cryptocurrency.\n\n"Yes. And it\'s a good thing. Listen, I\'m an investor. I want to see Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) at a hundred thousand dollars. It\'s never going to get there, ever, if it\'s never going to be owned by institutions. It\'s never going to be owned by institutions where the next crypto exchange gets sued every week. It\'s over. It\'s over. That\'s got to stop. And we\'ve got to figure it out," O\'Leary said.\n\nThe Shark Tank star and financial expert elaborated on the crucial need for institutional investment to drive the value of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to new heights. "If we want institutions to get a 1% to 3% allocation so that you can start to see capital appreciation on crypto assets, we\'re going to need real money. We can\'t do it with the crypto community. It\'s too small. There\'s a fraction. It\'s a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction of the world financial system."\n\n"We\'ve got to open it up, and we\'ve got to get rid of the role players and the fraudsters, and you know, that\'s over. It\'s just over. And it\'s boring too. I\'m sick of it," he added.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin\'s \'Fake Pump Seems Over:\' Crypto Analyst Capo Predicts Price Drop To $12K\n\nThe discussion, which took place ahead of Benzinga\'s upcoming conference in New York on Nov. 13, brought to light the challenges and opportunities facing the crypto space. O\'Leary\'s candid remarks underscore the need for a regulatory framework that encourages institutional investment while mitigating risks associated with fraudulent activities in the crypto space.\n\nO\'Leary is slated to be a keynote speaker at Benzinga\'s Fintech Deal Day & Awards, where attendees can use the code BZFINTECH to receive a 20% discount on their ticket purchase. The event, happening at Convene in NYC, will be followed by Benzinga Future of Digital Assets, further diving into the evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies and digital assets.\n\nHis conversation with Benzinga highlighted the urgent need for a shift from the \'Wild West\' era of crypto, which has been characterized by a lack of regulation and a high level of speculative trading, to a more mature and stable financial ecosystem that can attract substantial investments from institutional investors.\n\nIt\'s clear from O\'Leary\'s insights that for cryptocurrencies to realize their full potential, embracing institutional investment is a necessary evolution.\n\n"We\'ve got to get rid of the role players and the fraudsters" says @kevinolearytv at Crypto Unlocked, advocating for institutional crypto investment.\n\nCatch him as a keynote speaker at Benzinga Fintech Deal Day & Awards.\n\nJoin us in NYC, on NOV 13!https://t.co/KOznB6N3h7 pic.twitter.com/Ly0Cq6R1zy\n\n— Benzinga (@Benzinga) October 2, 2023\n\n© 2023 Benzinga.com.

In the meantime, Grayscale is lengthening its lead by applying to convert the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) to a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nGrayscale will be speaking at Benzinga\'s Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 14 in NYC.\n\nThe Grayscale Ethereum Trust represents 2.5% of all ETH in circulation and is the largest ETH investment vehicle in the world. Grayscale stated that the ETHE trust has always been on the path to becoming an ETF. Currently, the Ethereum underlying the trust is discounted at 30%, but the ETH would be worth $5.14 billion at full market value.\n\nShares of ETHE spiked 6.15% in value following the announcement of the spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nTim Draper, a prominent investor and entrepreneur known for successful investments in companies such as Tesla, Skype, and Coinbase, gave Benzinga exclusive comments on the Grayscale spot BTC ETF application. To Draper, approval seems to be a matter of time: "I am surprised it has taken so long. I\'m not sure why the SEC approved futures and not spot trading. It seems capricious," Draper said.\n\nHe expects the availability of a spot Bitcoin ETF to encourage more adoption and investments in BTC.\n\n"It will allow more people to participate in this new global, open, transparent, frictionless economy provided by Bitcoin and its blockchain. It will bring more light on the unbanked who can use Bitcoin to participate in the global economy," Draper said.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin\'s \'Fake Pump Seems Over:\' Crypto Analyst Capo Predicts Price Drop To $12K\n\nOne month ago, Circuit Judge Neomi Rao wrote a DC Circuit Court of Appeals opinion that favored Grayscale\'s application to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a more accessible Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). Rao\'s opinion said, in part, "The Commission failed to adequately explain why it approved the listing of two Bitcoin futures ETPs but not Grayscale\'s proposed Bitcoin ETP. In the absence of a coherent explanation, this unlike regulatory treatment of like products is unlawful. We therefore grant Grayscale\'s petition for review and vacate the Commission\'s order."\n\nOther applicants for a spot BTC ETF include ARK Investment, BlackRock, Bitwise, Fidelity/Wise Origin, GlobalX, Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF, VanEck, and WisdomTree.\n\nInvestor, author, and Forbes contributor Clem Chambers said: "It seems unlikely that there will be much of a gap between applicants if a BTC ETF is cleared… To me it\'s anyone\'s guess when it will be approved, but if the SEC had its way there will be no ETF unless they think it will be a negative for Bitcoin and crypto."\n\nThe legal victory in DC compels the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to revisit the Grayscale application for a spot BTC ETF after rejecting it.\n\nBloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart welcomed the news by raising the odds of the SEC approving a spot Bitcoin ETF to 75% by the end of 2023 and 95% by the end of 2024.\n\nFind out more about Bitcoin and its history.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that there is a high level of activity on the Ethereum network with a significant amount of value being transferred. However, the MACD signal indicating a sell suggests a potential bearish trend in the market. The news analyst report further supports this bearish sentiment, highlighting a general negative trend in the cryptocurrency market, including potential downward pressure on ETH due to regulatory issues and decreasing trading activity.

Reflecting on my past performance and the current market conditions, it is clear that a more conservative trading approach is necessary to minimize risks and preserve capital. It is crucial to stay informed about key trends and indicators in the market and adapt trading strategies accordingly. Implementing stop-loss orders and proper risk management strategies is essential to protect against potential losses.

In conclusion, the overall market trend appears to be bearish in the short term due to regulatory issues, decreasing trading activity, and the MACD signal indicating a sell. Therefore, a long-term strategy focused on risk management and capital preservation is recommended. 

Based on the synthesized reports and the need for a conservative approach, I would take a trading action of -0.5 to reflect my cautious stance in the current market environment.
ACTION:
-0.5
DAILY RETURN:
0.008317969476739018
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, we see a bearish trend in the ETH market with a potential decrease in demand and price. The decrease in unique addresses and the average fee, along with the sell signal on the MACD, all point towards a negative outlook for ETH. 

On the other hand, the news analyst report suggests a cautiously optimistic trend in the market, with a potential for a recovery in the near term due to positive monthly closes for Bitcoin and historical bullish trends in October. This could lead to a relief rally for Bitcoin and boost interest in altcoins, including ETH.

Reflecting on my recent trading performance and the current market conditions, it is clear that a conservative approach focused on risk management and capital preservation is crucial. While short-term gains may be tempting, it is important to prioritize long-term strategies that protect against potential losses and adapt to changing market conditions.

Considering the synthesized reports and the need for a cautious approach, I would take a slightly bearish stance on ETH and decide to sell a small portion of my holdings. My trading action would be -0.3, reflecting my moderate confidence in the bearish trend and my strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.
ACTION:
-0.3
DAILY RETURN:
-0.0033649180806775147
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is experiencing fluctuations with a potential downward bias. The MACD signal remains on sell, indicating a bearish trend, and the increase in average fees poses challenges for traders. On the other hand, the news analyst report suggests a bullish trend in the cryptocurrency market, driven by positive developments such as the launch of Ether futures exchange-traded funds and Bitcoin staking protocol.

Reflecting on the recent trading performance and considering the current market conditions, it is essential to adopt a cautious and conservative approach. While short-term gains may be tempting, prioritizing long-term strategies focused on risk management and capital preservation is crucial in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market.

Taking into account the synthesized reports and the importance of long-term strategies, I would recommend a conservative trading action. Therefore, I would opt for a slight sell action with a confidence level of 0.2 to manage risks appropriately and protect against potential losses in the uncertain market environment.

While public data often provides a partial view of cryptocurrency activities, this study utilized a novel approach, including the development of a new "global Bitcoin mapping system" that also reportedly incorporates non-public data from private companies.\n\nDetails about the proprietary system were not provided by the report. Notably, however, it did acknowledge that its data is likely imperfect given it remains possible to use Bitcoin anonymously and without identification.\n\nThe system tracked transactions, addresses, and wallet movements to paint a more complete picture of Bitcoin\'s cross-border payment activities, the report said.\n\nMoreover, the study revealed that Bitcoin was increasingly being used for remittances, providing a lifeline for individuals in regions with limited access to traditional banking services. Its borderless nature and ease of use made it an attractive option for sending funds across international boundaries.\n\nThe findings of this study are expected to stimulate further discussions among regulators, financial institutions, and policymakers regarding the role of cryptocurrencies in cross-border transactions.\n\nFounded in the 1930s, the BIS is owned by member central banks, and its primary goal is to "foster international monetary and financial cooperation."\n\nAs such, the report demonstrates a continued interest in Bitcoin among global central banks, some who want a stronger regulatory approach to the technology.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.'}, {'id': 2, 'time': 'Wed, 04 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Did bitcoin leak from an American spy lab? - The Economist', 'content': 'Listen to this story.

Most scientists think it jumped from wild animals to humans at a meat market in Wuhan. But it is also possible it escaped from a virology research lab in the same city.\n\nNow a similar argument has broken out around bitcoin, the first and most used cryptocurrency. Bitcoin’s accepted origin is that it was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonymous coder, who published a paper describing it in 2008 before later vanishing from sight.\n\nBut a theory circulating online holds that bitcoin was dreamed up by the National Security Agency ( NSA ), an American spy agency that also does cutting-edge cryptography research. “I think it was a shuttered internal R & D project which one researcher thought was too good to lay fallow on the shelf and chose to secretly release,” tweeted Nic Carter, a prominent bitcoin fan. Mr Carter and his fellow travellers think they have a smoking gun: a paper written in 1996 by NSA employees entitled “How to make a mint: the cryptography of anonymous electronic cash”. And the paper cites work by a researcher named “Tatsuaki Okamoto”.\n\nBut the paper is more smoke than gun. It is merely a survey of cryptographic ideas that might be used in digital cash. Unlike bitcoin, whose big innovation was its decentralised design, the schemes in the paper rely on an overseeing authority. It discusses the risks that electronic cash would pose to taxation and law enforcement. “Thus the idea that the NSA would develop a decentralised, trustless cryptocurrency as a ‘monetary bioweapon’ that would impair their own government’s functions” is implausible,” writes David Rosenthal, a cryptocurrency sceptic, on his blog.\n\nJust another conspiracy theory, then? Almost certainly. But something similar has happened before. In 1997 it emerged that Clifford Cocks, a mathematician at GCHQ , Britain’s NSA equivalent, had secretly invented a vital cryptographic technology that underlies both bitcoin and the internet in general, several years before the trio of American researchers who had been given credit.\n\nA better parallel between bitcoin and covid-19 may be that, like the virus, the cryptocurrency has proved hard to kill off. Despite a big crash last year, a bitcoin is still worth around $27,500. ■'}, {'id': 36, 'time': 'Wed, 04 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Bitcoin Edges Higher to $27.7K; AVAX, XRP Jump as Crypto Market Settles - Yahoo Finance', 'content': 'Bitcoin (BTC) edged higher Wednesday, gaining 1.3% over the past 24 hours as headwinds in traditional markets alleviated and crypto markets calmed after Monday’s sharp rally.\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was changing hands at around $27,700 during U.S. afternoon hours.

However, the initial surge on Monday lacked a significant follow-through, as BTC trading volume dropped to $11 billion from $19 billion.\n\nEnigma Securities, an institutional digital asset liquidity and advisory firm, forecasted Wednesday in a report that low volatility on crypto markets will prevail for the next months.\n\nMarkets will likely consolidate and chop sideways in October, extending the window for accumulation for long-term investors, Vetle Lunde, senior analyst at K33 Research, noted in a market report.\n\nThe broader crypto market-proxy CoinDesk Market Index inched 0.8% higher.\n\nTraditional markets calmed after a turbulent Tuesday session as fresh jobs data pointed to a cooling U.S. labor market.\n\nThe ADP reported earlier today that the U.S. economy added 89,000 jobs in September, significantly less than the 153,000 analysts expected and August’s 180,000.

"""
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, we see a bearish trend in the ETH market with a potential decrease in demand and price. The decrease in unique addresses and the average fee, along with the sell signal on the MACD, all point towards a negative outlook for ETH. 

On the other hand, the news analyst report suggests a cautiously optimistic trend in the market, with a potential for a recovery in the near term due to positive monthly closes for Bitcoin and historical bullish trends in October. This could lead to a relief rally for Bitcoin and boost interest in altcoins, including ETH.

Reflecting on my recent trading performance and the current market conditions, it is clear that a conservative approach focused on risk management and capital preservation is crucial. While short-term gains may be tempting, it is important to prioritize long-term strategies that protect against potential losses and adapt to changing market conditions.

Considering the synthesized reports and the need for a cautious approach, I would take a slightly bearish stance on ETH and decide to sell a small portion of my holdings. My trading action would be -0.3, reflecting my moderate confidence in the bearish trend and my strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.

You'll Want to Read This First - The Motley Fool", 'content': "Investors are discovering new ways to put their Bitcoin (BTC -2.59%) holdings to use as the cryptocurrency becomes more widely accepted in the financial world. One such option is to use Bitcoin as collateral to secure a loan.\n\nAs Bitcoin continues to move forward, there is a growing desire among holders to access the asset's liquidity without having to sell it. However, investors interested in obtaining a Bitcoin-backed loan will quickly realize that there are significant differences compared to traditional loans.\n\nHere's a detailed overview of what these loans entail to help investors make more informed decisions about Bitcoin-backed loans and the various options available.\n\nGeneral differences\n\nLike any other loan, the total value of the loan holders can obtain depends on the amount of collateral they can offer. Loans on some other assets, like some mortgage products with real estate as collateral, offer up to 97% loan-to-value (LTV), meaning they only need to offer up to 3% of the total loan as collateral. However, Bitcoin's extreme price volatility means that those seeking to leverage their holdings will face more stringent borrowing terms.\n\nActual conditions vary between lenders and depend on market conditions, but it isn't uncommon for Bitcoin loans to require LTV ratios as high as 50%. Under these circumstances, a potential borrower with $500,000 in Bitcoin could only borrow up to $250,000. Compare this to a prospective home buyer looking for a mortgage, where one might be able to borrow $485,000 toward a $500,000 home, assuming they meet specific criteria.\n\nNot only do Bitcoin loan borrowers have to pledge more collateral, but the interest rates tied to these loans are generally much higher. While the average mortgage interest rate hovers around 8% today, Bitcoin borrowers should generally expect rates to be even higher than this, at times up to 15%.\n\nAvailable options\n\nClearly, there are distinct differences to consider when looking to obtain Bitcoin-collateralized loans. But sometimes, personal conditions or financial goals warrant exploring Bitcoin loans. For those interested, there are two main routes to obtain Bitcoin loans: Centralized and decentralized lenders.\n\nCentralized lending platforms provide a more traditional approach to obtaining loans using Bitcoin as collateral. These platforms, operated by a centralized authority such as a company or bank, are usually more straightforward and accessible. Typically, users can choose to receive loans in fiat currency or in stablecoins. The advantages of centralized lenders include a less complicated process, higher loan amounts compared to decentralized platforms, and potential access to a broader range of assets for borrowing. Popular centralized options include Unchained Capital, Binance, and Bitfinex.\n\nHowever, the centralized platforms aren't without their risks. During the recent crypto winter and market volatility hit, multiple crypto lenders became insolvent, ultimately putting borrowers' assets at risk.\n\nDecentralized Bitcoin loans, facilitated through decentralized finance (DeFi) blockchains like Stacks or Wrapped Bitcoin, offer an alternative to collateralize Bitcoin without having to trust or rely on a centralized intermediary. By locking up Bitcoin, users can generate a loan in stablecoins or other cryptocurrencies. This method substantially reduces counterparty risk, as the process is managed by smart contracts, providing transparency and security.\n\nLike the centralized platforms, there are some drawbacks with DeFi lenders. The interest rates on DeFi loans are often not fixed and can be highly volatile. Additionally, the DeFi space can be complex, potentially posing challenges for less experienced users.\n\nFinal considerations\n\nFor investors seeking swift access to liquidity without triggering taxable events, Bitcoin loans can present a valuable financial opportunity. However, as with any financial decision, careful consideration of individual circumstances and alignment with personal goals is crucial.\n\nWhether people are opting for centralized lenders with their established systems or decentralized platforms offering alternatives, understanding the collateralization process, loan terms, and associated risks like interest rates and potential smart contract vulnerabilities is paramount. Ultimately, the decision to leverage Bitcoin as collateral for loans demands a balance between financial objectives and risk tolerance."}, {'id': 0, 'time': 'Thu, 05 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Visa is Bringing Bitcoin Pollution Everywhere You Want to Be - greenpeace.org', 'content': 'Visa is Bringing Bitcoin Pollution Everywhere You Want to Be\n\nVisa is just about everywhere with its credit and debit card offerings accepted by millions of merchants around the globe and used by millions of people to make their daily purchases. Now, the world’s largest payment processor is also exploring new ways for customers and businesses to use Bitcoin.\n\nVisa is just about everywhere with its credit and debit card offerings accepted by millions of merchants around the globe and used by millions of people to make their daily purchases. Now, the world’s largest payment processor is also exploring new ways for customers and businesses to use Bitcoin. This support for Bitcoin contradicts the company’s stated commitments to sustainability and reducing climate warming emissions because Bitcoin is an electricity hog, often powered by dirty energy. Bitcoin operations could become even worse due to adoption driven by Visa’s new services.\n\nWhile Visa has extensive expertise on cryptocurrencies, the company is not putting those resources to work on cleaning up Bitcoin’s pollution and climate impacts despite making strong corporate climate action pledges.\n\nHelping Grow Bitcoin’s Pollution\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin is primarily a speculative investment in which people bet on whether its price goes up or down. With support from Visa and other large financial services companies, that could change. Visa is making it easier for people to buy, trade, and spend bitcoin which is vital for the cryptocurrencies growth and its actual use for transactions. Visa is collaborating with crypto exchanges to let people buy their morning cup of coffee or weekly groceries using bitcoin. For example, people in the U.S. who store bitcoin in a Coinbase wallet can spend it at any merchant in Visa’s vast network thanks to a card issued in partnership with Coinbase.\n\nMore widespread use and greater demand means a higher bitcoin price, which has historically contributed to Bitcoin’s enormous energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. [1] Here’s why: when the price of bitcoin is high, there is incentive for “miners” to employ more computing power and electricity in the digital guessing game to win new bitcoin and fees.\n\nMuch of Bitcoin’s electricity use is generated by fossil fuels: 62% globally according to estimates from Cambridge University researchers. And dirty coal is the largest single source.\n\nBitcoin miners using more energy also puts more demand on often-strained electrical grids and uses energy that could be directed towards other socially necessary uses including the rapid expansion of electrification that is needed to address the climate crisis.\n\nPutting Dirty Bitcoin in Your Wallet\n\nVisa is one of several large financial services companies leading the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nVisa has multiple crypto-linked credit and debit cards that enable customers to spend and earn rewards in bitcoin. One such card is offered in partnership with Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the United States. The Coinbase card automatically converts Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to US Dollars at point of sale with any retailer in Visa’s network. Customers can also earn reward points in bitcoin. Visa also partnered with Crypto.com, another large crypto exchange company, to support a prepaid card that customers can load with bitcoin. This joins other bitcoin rewards debit cards like the one offered by Fold in collaboration with Visa which has reportedly rewarded over $30 million in bitcoin since launching in 2020.\n\nConcerningly, Visa is also expanding its crypto offerings around the world despite mounting evidence of Bitcoin’s climate impact. The company recently launched a debit card in collaboration with EU crypto exchange Lama that allows customers to spend their bitcoin. Visa created a long-term strategic partnership with Wirex, a crypto platform and exchange company, to expand in the United Kingdom and Asia-Pacific by offering crypto debit and prepaid cards.\n\nPartnerships with crypto companies and products that enable using bitcoin have created a growing business for Visa. In the first quarter of 2022, Visa reported that customers made $2.5 billion worth of purchases on their Visa crypto cards. The company said its network of crypto wallet partners grew from 54 to 65 by early 2022, including Coinbase, Circle, and BlockFi, and that almost 100 million merchants now accept crypto, including bitcoin, on the Visa network. In February 2023, Visa leaders denied a Reuters report claiming the company was pausing new crypto partnerships and services, and reaffirmed that the company was still moving forward into the crypto sector.\n\nVisa also helps other companies adopt cryptocurrencies. And because Bitcoin has the largest market cap of any cryptocurrency, this certainly includes Bitcoin.

While short-term gains may be tempting, prioritizing long-term strategies focused on risk management and capital preservation is crucial in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market.

Taking into account the synthesized reports and the importance of long-term strategies, I would recommend a conservative trading action.

Given the current market conditions and the potential for further price declines in ETH, it is advisable to prioritize capital preservation and cautious trading decisions.

Therefore, my trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.7, reflecting a high level of caution and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately in the current market environment.

Bitcoin Beach, an innovative initiative, has not only changed lives but also paved the way for El Salvador\'s historic Bitcoin legal tender law. The documentary "Dare to Dream: A Story From El Salvador," directed by Joe Delahunty, along with producer and funder Graham Rittener, unravels the true narrative behind this groundbreaking movement, dispelling myths and showcasing the transformative power of Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nOn a visit to El Zonte, Rittener was inspired by the work Bitcoin Beach and Hope House were doing to improve their community. He noticed that although there is a lot of technical and macroeconomic content, there was a gap in covering the human stories behind Bitcoin, especially regarding the rise of Bitcoin Beach. Rittener, especially saw the positive aspect that Bitcoin was having in changing people\'s lives. He also wanted to make the content relevant not just to Bitcoiners but to the general public as a whole through qualitative stories that they could connect with.\n\nTo that end, it was important that the film took the audience through answering the question of "what is money?" Here, Bitcoin philosopher and podcaster Robert Breedlove, in a friendly and accessible manner, guides the audience through this complex question.\n\nThe Genesis of Bitcoin Beach\n\n"Dare to Dream" illuminates the origins of Bitcoin Beach, dispelling the mystery that surrounded its inception. With meticulous precision, Delahunty traces the roots of this groundbreaking movement, unearthing untold stories that led to an unprecedented financial revolution in El Zonte.\n\nThe film vividly portrays Bitcoin\'s potential, surpassing mere speculation. Through intimate vignettes, we witness the profound impact of Bitcoin as a tool, liberating El Zonte from violence and despair, offering a beacon of hope, and a chance for young individuals to remain rooted in their community.\n\nAs the legal tender law gained momentum, what began as a grassroots movement got entangled in political debate. The media frenzy threatened to misrepresent Bitcoin Beach, yet at its core, the project remained steadfast, apolitical, and a testament to the enduring power of community-driven initiatives.\n\nPersonal Journeys: Hopes, Dreams, and Love for Community\n\n"Dare to Dream" introduces us to the individuals who birthed Bitcoin Beach, giving voice to their aspirations and love for family, community, and country. Roman Martinez (Chimbera) and Jorge Valenzuela, lifelong friends turned trailblazers, candidly share why Bitcoin became a lifeline. The film also unravels the enigmatic story of the anonymous Bitcoin funder, shedding light on how Mike Peterson, in collaboration with Chimbera and Valenzuela, turned this vision into reality.\n\nDocumentary still shot provided by Joe Delahunty.\n\nThe educational efforts by Chimbera and Valenzuela went beyond Bitcoin, equipping the community with technical knowledge to navigate Lightning Bitcoin wallets and bridging the gap for an unbanked non-technical audience, tailoring the education and wallet solutions to suit unique community needs.\n\nThe educational facet became a catalyst for holistic empowerment, extending to English language classes and diverse skill-building initiatives. Surfing, soccer, art, and drama classes emerged as strategic investments in the personal development of the community\'s future leaders.\n\nDocumentary still shot provided by Joe Delahunty.\n\nMultifaceted Realities: El Salvador\'s Bitcoin Adoption\n\n"Dare to Dream" features the testaments of renowned figures in the Bitcoin space, providing a unique perspective on the ongoing evolution of Bitcoin adoption. Max Keiser, who relocated to El Salvador and committed significant resources, shares some of his insights on Bitcoin adoption, while Nicolas Burtey, CEO of Galoy, emphasizes the role of Lightning as a means to empower communities. The documentary also shows podcaster John Vallis conducting interviews with locals and industry players.\n\nAdditionally, the film delves into a comprehensive exploration of how Bitcoin is integrating into the fabric of Salvadoran society. It reveals a tapestry of benefits beyond digital currency, from innovative remittance methods to a burgeoning tourism boom and merchant empowerment through reduced fees.\n\nDocumentary still shot provided by Joe Delahunty.\n\nA Beacon of Possibility\n\nWhile audiences are required to pay to view the film, it was created as a non-profit project, and if the film makes any profit, 90% of the proceeds will go directly to help the educational outreach efforts of Bitcoin Beach and Hope House.\n\n"Dare to Dream: A Story From El Salvador" is a powerful testament to Bitcoin\'s potential to bring tangible change. It transcends borders, representing a beacon of possibility for a more inclusive and prosperous world. Every Bitcoiner and anyone intrigued by the potential of Bitcoin should witness this story, f...'}]

The recent news articles indicate a mixed sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin experiencing a slight decline following the U.S. jobs report release, while Ethereum-based financial products, particularly Ether ETFs, gained attention and saw positive developments. Bitcoin's price movements may be influenced by factors such as interest rates and inflation data, while Ethereum's rise in popularity and institutional investment flows could contribute to a positive market trend.

"""
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, we see that the ETH market is experiencing fluctuating trends with potential downside risks in the near term. The MACD signal remains on sell, indicating a bearish trend. The total transactions and total size used are increasing, but the average fee has been inconsistent, suggesting volatility in transaction costs.

On the other hand, the news analyst report presents a mixed sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, with concerns about potential price drops in BTC but optimism surrounding institutional investment and mining efficiency, which could drive the value of cryptocurrencies like ETH to new heights.

Reflecting on the reports, it is clear that a cautious and conservative approach is necessary in managing risks and preserving capital in the volatile cryptocurrency market. While there may be short-term fluctuations and uncertainties, prioritizing long-term strategies focused on risk management and adaptability to changing market conditions is crucial.

Considering the conflicting signals and uncertainties in the market, I would take a conservative approach and assign a trading action of 0.3, reflecting moderate confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately. This approach will help mitigate potential losses and safeguard against market fluctuations, aligning with the need for a more conservative trading strategy in the current market environment.

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the ETH market is currently experiencing volatility and a bearish trend, as indicated by the MACD signal and fluctuating market activity. The news analyst report, on the other hand, presents a cautiously optimistic outlook with a potential bullish bias towards Bitcoin, leading to investors rotating into Bitcoin from Ether due to underperformance. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a conservative trading approach, focusing on long-term strategies and risk management in the face of market uncertainties.

Synthesizing these reports, it is clear that while short-term gains may be tempting, a long-term strategy focused on risk management and adaptability is crucial in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. Given the current market conditions and the potential for further price declines in ETH, it is advisable to prioritize capital preservation and cautious trading decisions.

Therefore, my trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.7, reflecting a high level of caution and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately in the current market environment. By taking a conservative approach and prioritizing long-term strategies, I aim to maximize overall profit and navigate the evolving cryptocurrency landscape effectively.

Factors such as a surge in the US 10-year Treasury yield by 11 basis points to reach 4.8% on Tuesday, and traders capitalizing on recent profits, led to a period of consolidation.The immediate resistance levels for Bitcoin on the upside are located around US$27,650 and subsequently US$28,000. A decisive breakthrough above the US$28,000 resistance level could trigger another bullish run. However, if Bitcoin fails to maintain its upward momentum, the next support level is positioned around US$27,400, with further support possibly at US$27,200.It\'s noteworthy that Bitcoin has demonstrated a remarkable year-to-date performance, surging by 65%, although it remains down by 59% from its all-time high.In parallel with Bitcoin, Ethereum closely followed a similar trajectory in its price action. Ethereum initiated an attempt at recovery, originating from the US$1,630 zone. Key resistance levels for ETH are seen at US$1,650 and then US$1,720. Failing to breach these immediate resistance levels could lead to a retracement, with the next crucial support situated at US$1,600. Despite a 66% decline from its all-time high, Ethereum has shown resilience in 2023, registering a 34% increase year-to-date.In an interesting turn of events, Ethereum futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have commenced trading in the US. Diverse investment firms, including ProShares, VanEck, Bitwise, Valkyrie, Kelly, and Volshares, collectively launched a total of 9 ETFs on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), marking a significant milestone in the crypto investment landscape.Furthermore, the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) has taken a proactive stance by offering guidance to cryptocurrency exchanges and issuers regarding their interim approach to what they term "value-referenced crypto assets." This guidance, with a specific focus on stablecoins , provides much-needed clarity and a regulatory framework for crypto-service providers operating in Canada.Lastly, following ongoing efforts to convert its Bitcoin Trust into an exchange-traded fund, Grayscale has now revealed its intentions to pursue a similar transformation for its Ethereum product, highlighting the growing interest and demand for crypto ETFs as traditional financial institutions embrace digital assets.Coming to the price action, among the top 100 cryptos by market cap, here are the best and worst-performing cryptos over the past week:As per prices on Friday.1. Trust Wallet Token is up by 20%2. Solana is up by 15%3. Bitcoin SV is up by 14%4. Avalanche is up by 13%5. Render is up by 13%1. Frax Share is down by 12%2. ApeCoin is down by 11%3. Pepe is down by 10%4. Compound is down by 9%5. Curve DAO Token is down by 9%(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

However, he didn’t specify how soon the crypto token would see such a rally. He made this assertion in response to a CNBC article about the current decline in the financial market amid economic and inflation concerns.\n\nIn a subsequent tweet, Keiser once again reiterated that Bitcoin would rise to $220,000 as he claims that “Central banks will print a wall of money visible from outer space.” His belief seems to stem from the fact that many will be looking to use Bitcoin as a hedge against rising inflation.\n\nHe even alluded to the fact that the US dollar was losing its purchasing power “at a very rapid pace.” He gave an instance of how paying $100 for hamburgers years ago looked like a joke, but he had just spent “$84 for a very ordinary hamburger.”\n\nFor the longest time, Keiser has been bullish on the foremost cryptocurrency. In 2011, he called Bitcoin the “currency of the resistance” and the “biggest story of the decade.” Additionally, he always touted a financial collapse as what would spark a massive rally in the Bitcoin price. Then, he stated that Bitcoin’s adoption and price will increase as banks collapse.\n\nArthur Hayes, the co-founder of BitMEX, also shares similar sentiments with Keiser. He recently stated that the government would likely resort to money printing to save the bond market, which could lead to a meteoric rise in Bitcoin’s price and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nBTC bulls struggle to maintain control | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nIs Inflation Good Or Bad For Crypto?\n\nThere seem to be divergent views on how rising inflation could affect Bitcoin and the crypto market by extension. While people like Keiser and Hayes see rising inflation as bullish for Bitcoin, others like Crypto analyst Nicholas Merten believe that inflation could spell more trouble for Bitcoin’s price.\n\nAccording to Merten, the Federal Reserve needs to keep hiking interest rates to bring down the inflation rate as there is excess money in the system due to the “excess printing of money.” Meanwhile, Bloomberg analyst Mike McGlone warned that the rising interest rates could cause a further decline in the Bitcoin price.\n\nThere also seems to be a correlation between the stock and crypto markets. As such, it doesn’t seem like Bitcoin and the crypto market exist in isolation, as any financial crisis could significantly impact it.\n\nFeatured image from The Face, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

"The market suffers from attention deficit disorder, so it always thinks every rally is the beginning of the next great bull market."\n\n2. "If everything works out badly, I would not be amazed if the S&P went to 2,000. That would require a couple of wheels to fall off, and wheels tend to fall off in the great bubbles\' unraveling, but it doesn\'t mean they have to. The S&P would be unlikely not to get to something close to 3,000."\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. "The simple arithmetic suggests you\'ll either have a dismal return forever, or you\'ll have a nice bear market and then a normal return. And the nice bear market will be hopefully less than a 50% decline, but it won\'t be a huge amount less than 50% from the peak in real terms."\n\n4. "You increase the pressure on a very complicated system until a few things snap. That is the pattern — something breaks and nobody seems to know what it is. It\'s always a surprise, but you always have a surprise, so the idea of a surprise is totally unsurprising."\n\n5. "My guess is we will have a recession. I don\'t know whether it will be fairly mild or fairly serious, but it will probably go deep into next year."\n\n6. "The most vulnerable area in my opinion is the Russell 2000. It often has no collective earnings at all. It has a very high density of zombies — companies that really can only pay their interest payments by issuing more debt. They\'re vulnerable on the debt front, vulnerable on the financial front, and vulnerable on a broad economic front."\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. "An over 40-year period of driving down mortgage rates, of course you drove up house prices all over the world, pretty much. And now the rates have gone up, of course it will drive down."\n\n8. "House prices are worse for the ordinary household. They\'re worse for the economy than stocks because they\'re substantially more broadly owned. It\'s really an important part of the median family\'s income picture and capital picture. The motto should be, \'Don\'t mess with housing.\' The super motto should be, \'Never have a housing bubble at the same time as you have a stock-market bubble.\'"\n\n9. "Although we didn\'t get carried away with ridiculous subprime this time, the multiple of family income actually went higher than it did in 2007. So in terms of actual long-term vulnerability posed by overpricing, this housing market was more overpriced, and it was accompanied by a much more overpriced and classically bubbly stock market than 2007."\n\n10. "Don\'t invest in real estate, don\'t invest in the US. If you have to invest in the US, quality has been the mispriced asset for 100 years. They outperform in bear markets. They underperform in bull markets, because you want to own Tesla, you want to own meme stocks, you want to own what\'s flying. You don\'t want to own Coca-Cola, it\'s just too boring."\n\nAdvertisement\n\n11. "When it comes to quality, they have less risk of every kind. They have less debt, they go bankrupt less, they have less volatility, they have a lower beta. Yet they outperform. That is a free lunch."\n\n12. "Bitcoin is, of course, an elaborate scam, really."\n\n13. "Commodities break your heart because just as they\'re doing well, they have a wipeout for 18 months, and then they go roaring back to a new high."\n\n14. "Artificial intelligence is absolutely for real. Is it big enough, soon enough to stop the deflating? No, I don\'t think it is. It\'s a 10-, 20-year, multi-decadal effect going off into the distant future, and it will be potentially vast in its effects."\n\nAdvertisement\n\n15. "I\'m not a great believer in economists. They\'ve lost the plot for the last 70 years. They\'ve forgotten their job description, which is to be useful. They drown in assumptions and closed systems, which are largely irrelevant for everything except their reputation inside their industry."\n\n16. "You should not be surprised if th...'}]

The cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, has shown signs of consolidation and recovery following recent price movements. Bitcoin is consolidating around the $27,500 to $27,800 range, with potential resistance levels at $27,650 and $28,000. Ethereum is also attempting a recovery, with key resistance levels at $1,650 and $1,720. Additionally, the launch of Ethereum futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US and regulatory guidance on stablecoins in Canada indicate growing institutional interest in the crypto market. However, contrasting views on inflation's impact on Bitcoin, along with warnings of a potential market crash and recession from experts like Jeremy Grantham, suggest a cautious approach may be warranted. Overall, the market trend appears to be cautiously optimistic with potential for further price movements based on regulatory developments and macroeconomic factors.

NEWS ANALYST REPORT:
"""
The cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, has shown signs of consolidation and recovery following recent price movements. Bitcoin is consolidating around the $27,500 to $27,800 range, with potential resistance levels at $27,650 and $28,000. Ethereum is also attempting a recovery, with key resistance levels at $1,650 and $1,720. Additionally, the launch of Ethereum futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US and regulatory guidance on stablecoins in Canada indicate growing institutional interest in the crypto market. However, contrasting views on inflation's impact on Bitcoin, along with warnings of a potential market crash and recession from experts like Jeremy Grantham, suggest a cautious approach may be warranted. Overall, the market trend appears to be cautiously optimistic with potential for further price movements based on regulatory developments and macroeconomic factors.

Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin (BTC) scraped the bottom of the barrel in the third quarter of the year, registering a loss of 11.1% for investors, barely beating long-term treasuries, which netted -11.9% over the same timeframe.\n\nGreg Cipolaro, Global Head of Research at Bitcoin firm NYDIG, wrote about the crypto’s poor performance and how it defies recent events in the crypto space.\n\nCipolaro pointed to favorable court cases, macroeconomic changes, the recent “quagmire” over government funding, the debate on U.S. debt, and the “ongoing efforts to secure approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF,” highlighting how none of these developments managed to push Bitcoin past the upper bound of its current range–which he said sits at $31,000.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin, however, wasn’t the only asset to register losses last quarter. In fact, almost every asset class—including gold and other precious metals, the U.S. stock market, and real estate—suffered important percentage drops.\n\nNotably, only four assets celebrated wins in the quarter, with commodities gaining 15.5%, seconded by cash at 1.3%.\n\nEconomist for the Heritage Foundation, Peter St. Onge, said a momentary pause in rising prices might be behind Bitcoin’s meager performance. “I think the main driver near-term has been inflation looking more sedate,” he told Decrypt, adding that gold also feels these effects.\n\nThis trend might not be long-lived, however. St. Onge pointed out that recent events in Israel might trigger price action in financial assets. “We’ll have to see what happens in the Middle East,” he said, explaining that “hard assets tend to shore up, but risk assets go down.”\n\nFor him, “Bitcoin is a bit of both.”\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSt. Onge’s views differ from those of NYDIG’s global head of research.\n\nCipolaro sees “persistently” high inflation, rising interest rates, “recession worries,” and seasonality weighed on returns, highlighting that Bitcoin tends to showcase dismal performances in the third quarter of every year. Perhaps in an effort to give investors hope, however, he wrote that the “lackluster performance” has a silver lining: the fourth quarter is historically one of the asset’s best quarters.\n\nIn spite of its most recent quarterly performance, Bitcoin investors will have to wait and see if the top cryptocurrency recovers its early 2023 trend, which has seen the asset on fire. Bitcoin has gained 63% on the year, only one of four to register double-digit gains, and is eclipsing its closest contender, U.S. Large Cap Growth Funds by more than double.'}, {'id': 1, 'time': 'Sun, 08 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Bitcoin bulls encircle $28K as trader says 'big' buyer must step in - Cointelegraph", 'content': "Bitcoin (BTC) kept up renewed pressure on $28,000 into the Oct. 8 weekly close as geopolitical uncertainty entered traders’ radar.\n\nBTC/USD 1-hour chart.

Going to require a big spot buyer to crack that area imo,” he told X (formerly Twitter) subscribers.\n\n“Perps are shorting every LTF bounce into $28K as well.”\n\nBitcoin order book data. Source: Skew/X\n\nSkew further described Bitcoin’s reaction to both that level and the 200-day moving average (MA), currently at $28,040, as “not the best kind.”\n\nFellow trader Daan Crypto Trades meanwhile cautioned on going short BTC should a sudden breakout occur, as this might form the start of further upside.\n\n“I will say that with BTC sitting around this big $28K level which has the Daily/Weekly 200MA sitting there, I am personally not very keen on shorting any deviations above,” part of an X post stated.\n\n“In the past, we’ve often seen a weekend breakout at these kinda spots which tend to not retrace as easily as they otherwise would.”\n\nAn accompanying chart showed the closing price of last week’s CME Bitcoin futures markets, this apt to form a price “magnet” going into the new week.\n\n“Trading around the CME price is best practiced during a ranging & choppy environment,” he added.\n\n“We are still in such environment but that would likely change upon a strong break above this region. Hence me not being too eager to short immediately in case we'd see a weekend pump.”\n\nBTC/USD annotated chart with CME Bitcoin futures data.

This exponential increase has caused concern and reflection on the nation’s fiscal path.\n\nAlarming surge: US adds more than half the market value of bitcoin to its debt in a single day\n\nIn a staggering turn of events, the US added a colossal $275 billion to its national debt in a single day, catapulting the nation’s total debt to an unprecedented $33.44 trillion.\n\nTo put things in perspective, this astronomical daily increase in US debt was more than half of the entire market capitalisation of bitcoin, a sum equivalent to around 10 million BTC.\n\nThis remarkable development underlines the continuing expansion of the US debt mountain, with billions of dollars being added to it every day.\n\nAstonishingly, this daily accumulation of debt exceeds the total market capitalisation of most cryptocurrencies. In this article we look at the implications and ramifications of this fiscal phenomenon.\n\nUS debt: half of bitcoin’s market capitalisation in debt\n\nOn 4 October, renowned Bitcoin pioneer Samson Mow astutely compared the monumental increase in US debt to the market capitalisation of bitcoin.\n\nThe result was astonishing to say the least: the increase in debt exceeded half of bitcoin’s market capitalisation of around $267 billion.\n\nTo put this figure into perspective, it is equivalent to around 10 million BTCs, a staggering sum that makes one ponder the relative value of $27,000 as a potential purchase price.\n\nFurthermore, the increase in debt has surpassed the entire market capitalisation of Ethereum, which currently stands at just under $200 billion.\n\nIn essence, this daily debt escalation represents a quarter of the total market capitalisation of cryptocurrencies, which is seamlessly integrated into the burgeoning national debt.\n\nNotably, this surge in US debt came just two weeks after the $33 trillion threshold was crossed, reflecting the exponential growth of US financial obligations.\n\nTo provide further context, this means that the US is adding $32 billion of debt every day, a pace that could potentially result in $1 trillion of debt maturing in a single month. This is double the previous rate of $14 billion per day.\n\nRising US debt servicing costs\n\nGoldman Sachs analysts have predicted that the cost of servicing the US’s colossal debt load will hit a new record by 2025.\n\nThe rise in borrowing costs over the past year, largely due to the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes, has put upward pressure on the cost of managing the gigantic national debt.\n\nIn 2022 alone, the US government will spend as much as $476 billion, or about 2% of national GDP, on servicing interest on the debt. However, interest payments are projected to rise to 3% of GDP by 2024, with an alarming projection of 4% of GDP by 2030.\n\nThe Peter G. Peterson Foundation has estimated that the US will have to spend the colossal sum of $10.6 trillion on interest payments on the national debt over the next decade.\n\nIn addition, other estimates have predicted an accelerated rate of growth in the debt-to-GDP ratio. According to a projection by the Congressional Budget Office, the federal debt could reach a staggering 181% of national GDP by 2053.\n\nDebt ceiling unlimited until 2025\n\nFinally, it is important to note that the debt ceiling, which limits the amount of debt the US can accumulate, will remain suspended until January 2025.\n\nAs a result, the staggering numbers associated with this surge in US debt will become the new normal, raising critical questions about the nation’s long-term fiscal sustainability.\n\nThe dramatic rise in US debt, which in a single day exceeded half the market capitalisation of bitcoin, is a financial phenomenon that demands attention and scrutiny.\n\nThe implications of this continued fiscal expansion go far beyond the cryptocurrency space and have profound implications for the US economy, interest rates and the country’s long-term financial stability.\n\nAs the United States continues to accumulate debt at an unprecedented rate, policymakers, economists and investors must grapple with the complex challenges and uncertainties this poses for the nation’s fiscal future.'}]

The news articles highlight a mix of factors impacting the cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin and its performance in the third quarter of 2023. Bitcoin experienced a loss in the quarter, reflecting a broader trend of losses across various asset classes.

Ether dropped as much as 5.4% to $1,639 on Monday, and the original cryptocurrency slipped as much as 2.3% to $27,290.'}, {'id': 17, 'time': 'Mon, 09 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Bitcoin Is Better Than Digital Gold: Matrixport - Yahoo Finance', 'content': 'The connection between gold and bitcoin (BTC) as stores of value is obvious, and the demand for BTC as a digital store of value was a big reason why the cryptocurrency grew in popularity, crypto services provider Matrixport said in a report Monday.\n\nBitcoin’s market capitalization is $540 billion, equivalent to 10.8% of the market cap of physical financial gold, Matrixport said, adding that gold exchange-traded-funds (ETFs) are valued at $200 billion.\n\nThis is why potential approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of a U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETF could result in inflows of $20 - $30 billion, potentially triggering a large rally in the cryptocurrency, the report said.\n\nThe SEC has dragged its heels on approving a spot bitcoin ETF, and in August said it was delaying its decision on all new applications until October. The crypto market is hopeful that such an approval will trigger a flood of mainstream money into the sector.\n\nStill, bitcoin has an edge over gold as the private keys can be memorized, which eliminates the risk of confiscation, the report said.\n\n“Even today, storing assets in the form of gold has not only become unfashionable in the digital age, but comes with significant restrictions when crossing borders,” wrote Markus Thielen, head of research at Matrixport, adding that “bitcoin offers a solution to this dilemma, enabling the swift and relatively inconspicuous movement of value across borders.”\n\n“Therefore, considering the current state of technological developments, bitcoin’s primary roles are likely as a store of value akin to gold and a speculative financial asset,” the report added.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin Price May Boom in October, Could Hit $37K by Year-End: Matrixport'}, {'id': 26, 'time': 'Mon, 09 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Joe Rogan Tells Sam Altman That Bitcoin Can Become A 'Universal Viable Currency' — Admits CBDCs 'Scares The Sh ... - Nasdaq", 'content': 'Podcaster Joe Rogan expressed his optimism for Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), highlighting its potential to become a “universal viable currency.”\n\nWhat Happened: In an episode of The Joe Rogan Experience podcast on Friday, Rogan said that Bitcoin’s limited supply and decentralized mining process make it an intriguing candidate for broader adoption.\n\nHe said, “The real fascinating crypto is Bitcoin. To me, that’s the one that I think has the most likely possibility of becoming a universal viable currency. It’s limited in the amount that there can be [and] people mine it with their own [computer]. That to me is very fascinating. I love the fact that it’s been implemented.”\n\nRogan invited Sam Altman, co-founder of OpenAI who also expressed his excitement about Bitcoin, stating, “I think this idea that we have a global currency that is outside of the control of any government is a super logical and important step on the tech tree.”\n\nWill The SEC Finally Approve Long-Awaited Bitcoin Spot ETF?

The push to that is not for the overall good of society, that’s for control.”\n\nEarlier in August, musician Post Malone joined Rogan to discuss the potential risks associated with CBDCs. Malone asked Rogan about his views on the government’s digital currency. Rogan strongly opposed CBDCs, stating, "No f**ing way. That\'s what I think. That\'s checkmate. That\'s game over." Malone agreed, adding, "That is f**ing checkmate."\n\nIn addition, Altman expressed disappointment with the U.S. government’s handling of the cryptocurrency industry, calling it a “war on crypto.” Altman believes that maintaining the freedom and independence of cryptocurrencies is crucial, stating, “We can\'t give this up, like we\'re going to control this and all that. That’s the thing that makes me quite sad about the country.”\n\nPhoto by AlyoshinE on Shutterstock\n\nRead Next: Here’s How Much You Should Invest In Shiba Inu Today For A $1M Payday If SHIB Hits 1 Cent?\n\n© 2023 Benzinga.com.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain, news, and reflection analyst reports, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing volatility and uncertainty. The on-chain data indicates fluctuating metrics and a consistent sell signal from the MACD indicator, suggesting potential downward pressure. The news report highlights mixed sentiment in the overall cryptocurrency market, with positive developments for Ethereum-based financial products but potential negative influences on Bitcoin's price movements. The reflection report emphasizes the importance of a conservative trading approach, focusing on long-term strategies and risk management to navigate market fluctuations effectively.

Considering the conflicting signals and uncertainties in the market, it is prudent to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains. By focusing on capital preservation and cautious trading decisions, investors can mitigate potential losses and safeguard against market volatility. While short-term gains may be tempting, a conservative approach is warranted to manage risks appropriately and maximize long-term profitability.

Based on the synthesized reports and the emphasis on long-term strategies, I would take a cautious approach and assign a trading action of -0.5, reflecting moderate confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately. This decision aligns with the recommendation to proceed with caution and closely monitor market developments, ensuring a balanced approach to trading ETH in the current uncertain market conditions.

DAILY RETURN:
-0.00016841417135293746
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the ETH market is currently bearish, with a downward trend in prices and a decrease in overall activity. The MACD signal consistently indicates a sell trend, further supporting the bearish outlook. 

On the other hand, the news analyst report presents a cautiously optimistic view of the market, highlighting signs of consolidation and recovery in both Bitcoin and Ethereum. The launch of Ethereum futures ETFs and regulatory guidance on stablecoins indicate growing institutional interest in the market.

Reflecting on the importance of a conservative approach and long-term strategies in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market, it is clear that prioritizing capital preservation and cautious trading decisions is crucial. Given the uncertainties and conflicting signals in the market, it is essential to manage risks appropriately and focus on maximizing long-term profitability.

Considering the synthesized reports, the market trend for ETH appears to be bearish in the short term but cautiously optimistic in the long term. Therefore, I would take a conservative approach and prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains. 

As a result, my trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.5, reflecting my cautious stance in the current market environment and my strategic decision to manage risks appropriately.

The fluctuations in unique addresses, coinbase transactions, average fees, total size used, and total value transferred all suggest uncertainty and potential price declines in the near future.

On the other hand, the news analyst report presents a more optimistic view, highlighting potential upward trends driven by geopolitical uncertainty, price catalysts, and forecasts of Bitcoin moving towards $30,000. However, concerns about US national debt and its impact on the cryptocurrency market add a layer of complexity to the overall market outlook.

In line with the reflection analyst report, which emphasizes a conservative approach based on long-term strategies and risk management, it is crucial to prioritize capital preservation and cautious trading decisions in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. Given the conflicting signals and uncertainties in the market, a conservative trading approach is warranted to manage risks appropriately and maximize long-term profitability.

Considering the synthesized reports, the overall market trend for ETH appears to be uncertain in the short term, with potential for further price declines but also the possibility of upward movements driven by external factors. Therefore, it is advisable to focus on long-term strategies over short-term gains to navigate the market effectively.

Bitcoin (BTC) outperformed the broad benchmark by declining -10.9% while ether (ETH) underperformed, posting a loss of -12.5% for the last 3 months.\n\nIt's helpful to view these numbers in the context of their year-to-date performance, where Bitcoin has gained an impressive 64%, and Ether has risen by 41%. This underscores the resilience of these cryptocurrencies as some of the top-performing assets in 2023. This quarterly outperformance of BTC versus ETH and the broader CMI is a continuation of a trend we’ve seen throughout the year. Institutional demand for Bitcoin ETFs continues to support BTC, while the continued regulatory pressure on alternative tokens drives the bifurcation in the crypto market between the established majors (Bitcoin and Ether) and other digital asset protocols and projects.\n\nSector-by-sector\n\nLooking within sector quarterly performance with the CoinDesk DACS framework, the trends and preferences towards larger capitalization tokens are less clear. Over Q3 of 2023, Computing (CPU, +3%) and DeFi sectors (DCF, -8%) were relative out-performers, while Smart Contract Platform (SMT, -13%), which contains Ether, and Culture and Entertainment (CNE, -22%) were relative under-performers. See the chart below for a full sector performance breakdown for Q3 of 2023.\n\nDACS Q3 2023 Performance (CDI Research)\n\nNews related to U.S. regulation was a key driver of price movements this quarter, with SEC actions featuring prominently in this. This followed regulatory enforcement action against Coinbase and Binance earlier in June. Meanwhile, regulatory filings for spot ETFs by some of the world's largest asset managers introduced a lot of price action ahead of potential approval dates.\n\nWhile July and August were relatively muted months for the market, September saw the outperformance of DeFi, Digitization and the Computing sector off the back of the partial Ripple court case win earlier in the month, and investor enthusiasm for AI, which propelled Chainlink (LINK), an on-chain data provider and the largest token of the Computing sector, to rise 24% for the month.\n\nStory continues\n\nSeptember also marked the one-year anniversary of Ethereum’s successful transition to a “Proof-of-Stake” consensus mechanism. This reduces the amount of computational work needed to verify blocks and transactions, effectively eliminating its carbon footprint. So far, the network has been operating as intended with staking assets becoming a popular way for crypto investors to enhance returns. CoinDesk Indices Composite Ether Staking Rate (CESR), a metric used to proxy the expected income from Ethereum staking activities, averaged 4% (annualized) over the quarterly period, trending lower to end September at 3.6%.\n\nOne significant shift in the cryptocurrency landscape in this quarter is the reduced level of risk, as defined by standard risk measures. We are now seeing lower levels of volatility, decreased correlation with traditional equities, and slightly reduced correlation among the top-30 tokens, as shown below.\n\nRolling Sector Correlations and Volatility (CDI Research)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis shift could be an indication of a maturation of the market, as investors are becoming more discerning across token sectors, or it could be an artifact of market illiquidity, as trading volumes continue to decrease across large cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nWhere next?\n\nBond yields are rising sharply off of a relatively hawkish September FOMC, where the summary of economic projections (i.e. “the dot plot”) eliminated the expectation for interest rate cuts in the near term. This dot plot guidance allowed the Federal Reserve to be clearer and more concise in indicating to the market that interest rates would have to be held higher for longer. While rising interest rates haven’t immediately impacted the price of digital assets, the tightening of financial conditions and strengthening of the U.S. dollar should be expected to add further headwinds to the price appreciation for crypto currencies. Coincidentally, the CoinDesk Bitcoin and Ether Trend Indicators have registered neutral to slightly negative trend signals over the first few days of Q4.\n\nA catalyst to break through the macroeconomic headwinds of tightening financial conditions could come in the approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF.\n\nWhy?\n\nFirstly, it would greatly enhance accessibility, allowing a broader range of investors to easily gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of direct purchase and storage, like how gold ETFs, starting in the early-2000s, simplified the process of gaining exposure to physical gold. This in turn could shift and diversify the investor base in cryptocurrencies, from tech-savvy enthusiasts to more mainstream, longer-term investors seeking diversification, which could result in a reduction in volatility across the digital asset market.\n\nAdditio..."}, {'id': 26, 'time': 'Tue, 10 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'The Bitcoin 16 Year Cycle, And Its Correlation To The Internet Bubble - Nasdaq', 'content': "Everyone has heard about the 4-year cycle that Bitcoin is going through, but have you ever thought of the idea that Bitcoin might be going through a bigger cycle? And could this bigger cycle reflect the way humans adopt new technologies? And is it possible we have seen something similar before with another technology like the internet? In this article, we will be diving into a new theory that suggests that Bitcoin is moving through a larger 16-year cycle which can help us predict the direction of the Bitcoin price in the coming years.\n\nThe Regular 4 Year Cycle\n\nBitcoin tends to go through 4-year cycles which are divided into 2 parts, the uptrend and the downtrend. A regular 4-year cycle consists of a 3-year uptrend followed by a 1-year downtrend also known as a bear market. So far Bitcoin has completed 4-year cycles and they’ve shown incredible accuracy which catches the attention of the market participants.\n\nChart from TradingView.\n\nThe DOTCOM Cycle\n\nOne can’t ignore the similarities between the market structure of the S&P500 during the DOTCOM cycle and the Bitcoin cycle. The regular financial markets also went through clear 4-year cycles with the majority of the cycle being in an uptrend and the downtrend, also known as a bear market, shortly lived. From my perspective, the DOTCOM cycle started around 1986 as this was the moment that Microsoft went public, one of the biggest companies of the DOTCOM cycle. The first 3 4-year cycles of Bitcoin look very similar to the first 3 4-year cycles of the S&P500 starting from 1986.\n\nChart from TradingView.\n\nThis really spiked my interests as both periods are based on the adoption of a completely new technology that shifts the way our society perceives and uses information. The personal computer and the internet changed our lives completely to the point that it’s almost unthinkable to be unconnected to the internet for more than 24 hours. In the future it will as well be unthinkable to not own and use any Bitcoin, we’re just still in the early phase of its adoption.\n\nSo could the structure of the DOTCOM cycle help us to determine a potential path for Bitcoin? First of all, I would like to emphasize the fact that market cycles in my honest opinion are one of the best ways to use rough price predictions and ascertaining when to enter and when to exit a particular market. But I really want to emphasize the word “rough”. There goes a saying, “history\n\ndoesn’t repeat itself but it sure does rhyme”, and I think this applies to cycles too. Nothing is ever a 100% replication of anything that happened before, but it can give us a rough estimate of what might happen.\n\nAs you can see in the structure of the DOTCOM cycle, the first 3 4-year cycles are very similar, a long bull market followed by a short but sometimes shallow bear market or correction. It's only that the last 4-year cycle is different, the tables are flipped upside down. It starts with an acceleration in the price which doesn’t last that long and is followed by a multi-year long bear market. Could Bitcoin do something similar, disappointing the ones who expect a regular 4-year cycle and surprise the majority with a multi-year-long bear market?\n\nMicrosoft is following a similar path. It starts with 3 4-year cycles that are right-translated, followed by a 4-year cycle that is left-translated, so a prolonged bear market in an asset that has been in a strong bull market for years.\n\nChart from TradingView.\n\nMicrosoft topped in the year 2000, marking a long-term top in the price at approximately $60. And it wasn't until 2015 that that level was broken again. It took 15 years from that high to completely recover and surpass that level again. If we were to take the money supply into consideration it actually takes longer for Microsoft to recover and break the high 21 years later in May 2021.\n\nChart from TradingView.\n\nBoth of these charts, Microsoft and the S&P500, really demonstrate the magnitude of a correction after a prolonged bull-market. It’s challenging to imagine from one's perspective a prolonged bear market of an asset you’ve experienced mostly going up. Is it possible that we’re going to see, in rough terms, something similar with Bitcoin?\n\nConfluence Between Cycles\n\nSo let’s have a look at what these cycles are forecasting for Bitcoin and how we potentially could prepare for these outcomes. First of all, it's interesting to note that one date is forecasting the same outcome in the regular 4-year cycle, the 16-year cycle.\n\nA regular 4-year cycle would suggest that we’re staying in an uptrend until 2025, followed by a 1- year decline. This is a typical 4-year cycle which we’ve seen 3 times in the history of Bitcoin.\n\nThe 16-year cycle would suggest that we would follow a similar path as the DOTCOM bubble as mentioned above. Bitcoin would peak within the first half of the cycle, so by the latest at the end of 2024, this would be followed by a multi-year-long decline going into 2026 to form new lows.\n\nHow To Spot ..."}]

Reflecting on the importance of a conservative approach and long-term strategies in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market, it is clear that prioritizing capital preservation and cautious trading decisions is crucial. Given the uncertainties and conflicting signals in the market, it is essential to manage risks appropriately and focus on maximizing long-term profitability.

Considering the synthesized reports, the market trend for ETH appears to be bearish in the short term but cautiously optimistic in the long term. Therefore, I would take a conservative approach and prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains.

However, concerns about US national debt and its impact on the cryptocurrency market add a layer of complexity to the overall market outlook.

In line with the reflection analyst report, which emphasizes a conservative approach based on long-term strategies and risk management, it is crucial to prioritize capital preservation and cautious trading decisions in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. Given the conflicting signals and uncertainties in the market, a conservative trading approach is warranted to manage risks appropriately and maximize long-term profitability.

Considering the synthesized reports, the overall market trend for ETH appears to be uncertain in the short term, with potential for further price declines but also the possibility of upward movements driven by external factors. Therefore, it is advisable to focus on long-term strategies over short-term gains to navigate the market effectively.

He also declined comment when asked about Felton’s comments in a letter to Bitcoin Depot’s chief operating officer that said the funds were seized in error.\n\nScott Buchanan, COO for Bitcoin Depot, said in a statement that the company cully cooperated with McLennan County law enforcement throughout the process. Buchanan reiterated Bitcoin Depot’s “diligence in protecting its customers from illegal activity, cooperating with law enforcement officials to reach a resolution and enacting procedures to help identify and eliminate future bad actors seeking to take advantage of unsuspecting citizens.”\n\nFelton did not respond to messages from KWTX on Wednesday.\n\n“The seizure of the money at that time was an error based on a misunderstanding that the funds belonged solely to the customer, not the company,” Felton wrote in a letter to Bitcoin Depo obtained by KWTX. “…Due to the timing of the communication and the return of the funds happening at the same time, the money was not maintained by law enforcement officials and, instead, was provided to the victim.”\n\nFelton wrote that because of a “misunderstanding and the difficulty in communication,” McLennan County officials were not aware of the company’s terms and conditions. He acknowledged the money no longer legally belonged to the customer at the time the cash was returned.\n\n“The release of the money to the McLennan County resident was based on a good faith belief that there were no competing claims for the legal interest of the money,” Felton wrote. “Officials later determined that it was premature to have distributed the money which was seized for ‘evidentiary purposes.’”\n\nFelton wrote he appreciated the company’s cooperation in trying to identify the scammer.\n\nWaco attorney Mike Dixon, who represents the county, said Bitcoin agreed to dismiss the lawsuit and the woman got to keep her money. The county paid Bitcoin Depot nothing, he said.\n\n“All Bitcoin wanted was a letter showing they weren’t the bad guys here, that they had procedures and warnings in place to try to stop this from happening and that they tell people not to send Bitcoin to wallets the person does not control,” Dixon said. “So it was more about making it clear that Bitcoin Depot wasn’t the scammer. This was a third-party international scammer and Bitcoin Depot was helpful in assisting and trying to locate the scammer.”\n\nThe Crawford woman reported the elaborate scam to the sheriff’s office on April 27, and a detective got a search warrant on May 3 to seize the money from the Bitcoin kiosk.\n\nAccording to the search warrant affidavit, the woman said she was online looking up cooking recipes when she received an email with a link to view a recipe. She clicked the link, which the affidavit said appears to have activated a “Ransomware” computer virus.\n\nShe contacted “customer support” and was transferred to a “fraud investigator,” the affidavit states. She was told all her personal information had been compromised and that the fraud department could help her work through the problem.\n\nThe woman said she should contact her bank and law enforcement but was told it was not necessary because at that point, nothing had happened with her bank account and a “computer virus” was not something law enforcement would respond to, according to the affidavit.\n\nNext, the “fraud investigator” asked if she had written a check for a laptop. She said no, and the “fraud investigator” said a check just cleared the bank that someone wrote to pay for a laptop.\n\n“The ‘fraud investigator’ then told (the woman) he could see where a check was written to a construction company in the amount of $15,000, which had not cleared yet. (The woman) was then given instructions on how to prevent the loss of this amount of money,” the affidavit states.\n\nThe woman was told to drive to her bank, make a $15,000 cash withdrawal and then go to the store and deposit it into the Bitcoin ...'}, {'id': 1, 'time': 'Wed, 11 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "What Grayscale's Victory in Bitcoin Case Means for Crypto Market - Bloomberg Law", 'content': 'The US Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit grabbed the attention of legal and crypto communities when it ruled, in Grayscale Investments v. SEC, that the agency had acted unlawfully in denying Grayscale’s application for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund or ETF.\n\nAlthough the decision was a significant win for Grayscale and the crypto industry, commentators may have missed important nuance. The decision appears to reflect a technical application of standard administrative law doctrine—and perhaps not, as commentators have assumed, a blanket rebuke of the SEC’s reluctance to embrace crypto.\n\nGrayscale Decision\n\nThe case stems from the SEC’s denial of Grayscale’s application to list a spot Bitcoin ETF, versus a Bitcoin futures ETF, on a national exchange. An ETF is an investment vehicle designed to track an asset’s value. While spot ETFs hold the asset itself, other ETFs hold derivates such as futures, which are contracts to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on a later date.\n\nThe SEC’s decision teed up a quintessential administrative law issue: whether the agency’s action was “arbitrary and capricious,” and therefore unlawful, under the Administrative Procedure Act or APA.\n\nIn a unanimous opinion, a three-judge panel ruled that the SEC’s action was indeed arbitrary and capricious, as the agency’s denial of Grayscale’s spot Bitcoin ETF couldn’t be squared with the agency’s prior approvals of Bitcoin futures ETFs.\n\nAccording to the panel, the SEC’s inconsistent treatment of the products violated a bedrock principle of administrative law: An agency must treat like cases alike.\n\nAlthough the SEC had attempted to thread the needle between them—noting that Bitcoin futures ETFs enjoy superior market-surveillance and fraud-detection mechanisms compared with spot Bitcoin ETFs—the panel rejected the SEC’s proffered distinctions.\n\nFor both products, the panel observed, the relevant surveillance-sharing agreements were identical and equally likely to detect fraud. The panel also highlighted the SEC’s failure to explain why fraud in the spot Bitcoin market was no obstacle to approving Bitcoin futures ETFs but was a basis to reject spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nSignificant But Limited Victory\n\nSoon after, commentators celebrated the Grayscale decision as a resounding rebuke of the SEC’s reluctance to embrace, if not hostility toward, the crypto industry. They particularly emphasized the panel’s unanimity.\n\nThe opinion’s Trump-appointed author, Judge Neomi Rao, had joined an Obama-appointee, Judge Sri Srinivasan, and a Carter appointee, Judge Harry Edwards, to rein in the SEC and safeguard crypto from the agency’s power grab. Reports also seized on the harsh phrase that the panel had repeatedly employed to describe the SEC’s conduct: “arbitrary and capricious.”\n\nThen again, to quote former D.C. Circuit Judge Abner Mikva, “‘arbitrary and capricious’ is a term of art in the hands of a reviewing court and has connotations less pejorative than the plain meaning of the words would suggest.”\n\nThe APA’s arbitrary-and-capricious review, as US Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh explained, requires a court to “ensure[] that the agency has acted within a zone of reasonableness and, in particular, has reasonably considered the relevant issues and reasonably explained the decision.”\n\nPut simply by former Justice Byron White, the standard’s touchstone is “reasoned decision-making.” Across a broad array of subjects, courts have routinely applied this familiar formula to strike down agency actions as “arbitrary and capricious.”\n\nFrom this perspective, the decision may not represent the resounding legal and political rout that the crypto community has deemed it. The case was technical, narrow, and the latest in a series of decisions reflecting methodical and dispassionate applications of APA arbitrary-and-capricious review.\n\nThe three panelists here—Judges Rao, Srinivasan, and Edwards—are known for their scholarly approaches to appellate judging and deep expertise in administrative law.\n\nWhat Comes Next?\n\nThe SEC may petition for a rehearing with all the D.C. Circuit’s judges. But such en banc review requires a majority vote and is warranted only to “maintain the uniformity of the court’s decisions” or to resolve “questions of exceptional importance.” It’s doubtful the panelists’ peers would view this straightforward case as a worthy candidate.\n\nThe SEC may also petition the Supreme Court for certiorari review. But even assuming that the panel erred, the court isn’t in the business of mere error correction, and the decision—a run-of-the-mill application of the APA—doesn’t appear to raise an issue that would move the court to exercise its jealously guarded certiorari jurisdiction. Nothing is certain, however.\n\nIf the SEC doesn’t appeal the decision, it must comply. Yet the agency has room to maneuver. For example, the SEC could approve all spot Bitcoin ETF applications simultaneously—not only Grayscale’s, but also its competitors’—thus d...'}]

Given the conflicting signals and uncertainties in the market, a conservative trading approach is warranted to manage risks appropriately and maximize long-term profitability.

Considering the synthesized reports, the overall market trend for ETH appears to be uncertain in the short term, with potential for further price declines but also the possibility of upward movements driven by external factors. Therefore, it is advisable to focus on long-term strategies over short-term gains to navigate the market effectively.

The crypto market continues to struggle from low volume and liquidity that have dragged on for most of the year. It has traded in a narrow range between $25,000 and $30,000 all year, which many had seen as encouraging, demonstrating that although investors weren\'t building positions, they weren\'t exiting either. "That changed this week with Monday seeing over $105 million in crypto liquidations, and the equal weight crypto index we track breaking down in turn," Wolfe Research\'s Rob Ginsberg said in a note Wednesday. "We have repeatedly touched on how uninspiring the price action has been outside of bitcoin, and it appears the cracks are finally starting to show." "While the resiliency of Bitcoin continues to be the one silver lining, it\'s growing increasingly clear just how alone it stands," he added. "[It\'s] rolling over again in the near term, but our thesis on bitcoin is simple: [as] long as $25,000 support is holding, we\'ll remain long." It takes a patient investor, however. Although bitcoin is up about 61% this year, it\'s off its all-time high by as much. Not only has it been unable to break out to new highs above $30,000 this year after hitting it for the first time this year as early as April, but it has also underperformed equities for the better part of two years. On top of that, Treasury yields remain high amid stubbornly high inflation and uncertainty around the Israel-Hamas war. "Higher yields have historically proven to be a headwind to crypto and growth alike," Ginsberg said. "Having failed to take advantage of this pullback thus far, if yields reaccelerate like we think, it should throw some added pressure on BTC." Crypto stocks are also trading down, but may be finding support now, according to Wolfe. "If these bases are for real … which we believe they are, a next leg higher will have to come soon," Ginsberg said. He also highlighted the Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF , which is back to its February highs and up about 90% this year. — CNBC\'s Michael Bloom contributed reporting.'}, {'id': 8, 'time': 'Thu, 12 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Investors sit out ether futures ETFs as spot bitcoin fund hangs in limbo - CNBC', 'content': 'Investor appetite for ether futures exchange-traded funds has remained muted, despite a surge in new listings.\n\nSix new ether futures funds from Bitwise Asset Management, ProShares and VanEck launched on Oct. 2. As of Thursday\'s close, all six funds have posted losses of 5% or greater since their debuts.\n\nThe broader outlook for crypto is partly to blame, Ric Edelman, founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, told Bob Pisani on CNBC\'s "ETF Edge" last Monday.\n\n"When [the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) ] generated a billion dollars on its launch of bitcoin futures, that was because it was brand new," said Edelman. "Frankly, bitcoin was doing fabulous at the time in 2021 and a lot of folks really didn\'t understand exactly what that fund was, being bitcoin futures. You fast-forward a couple of years, people have learned a lot."\n\nThe six ether futures funds that debuted Oct. 2 attracted just $1.92 million collectively on their first day of trading, according to LSEG. When the BITO ETF — a futures product based on bitcoin — launched in late 2021, it saw approximately $1 billion of inflows in its first two trading days alone.\n\nCryptocurrencies underlying the futures-based products are still well off their all-time highs reached in November 2021. Bitcoin is hovering near $27,000 — more than $40,000 below its peak — while ether is down more than 60% from its high, currently valued near $1,500.\n\nEdelman added that the nature of futures ETFs may be keeping some investors on the sidelines.\n\n"People are recognizing, \'I don\'t ordinarily buy futures, so if I\'m not buying futures in the stock market, why would I buy futures in the crypto market?\'"\n\nCurrently, regulators are weighing the approval of cryptocurrency spot ETFs that trade based on the current market price of the underlying asset, rather than futures contracts.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has previously blocked spot bitcoin ETFs from coming to market, but a federal appeals court in August overturned a ruling that would prevent Grayscale from converting its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF. The SEC has until Friday to appeal the decision.\n\nAccording to Edelman, consumer safety is at stake.\n\n"The absence of a spot bitcoin ETF isn\'t stopping people from buying crypto. It\'s just forcing them to pay for exotic products that cost more and have less liquidity and higher risk," he said.\n\nDisclaimer'}, {'id': 51, 'time': 'Thu, 12 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Crypto Price Today: Bitcoin falls below $27,000; Ethereum holds above $1,550 level - The Economic Times', 'content': '\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe crypto tokens were trading mixed in Thursday\'s trade with a negative bias.

At the same BTC price, Ethereum was trading at $1,800 in July but now it is trading at $1,560. This trend will likely continue through this month. BTC has to reclaim $27,400 in the upcoming days to negate its bearish momentum. Risks of increased oil prices and negative jobs outlook continue to dampen spirits in the crypto ecosystem," Vikram Subburaj, CEO of Giottus Crypto Platform, said.On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin demonstrated its technical position at $26,780, with a critical point set at $27,000. Notable resistance levels include $27,300, $27,745, and up to $28,280. Conversely, immediate support lies at $26,414, with additional levels at $26,186 and $25,989.

The investor said Bitcoin might be the only asset on the planet with higher demand that can’t have the supply increased.\n\n“ [If] you have higher demand for gold, we’ll build more mines. Bitcoin has a finite supply.”\n\nScaramucci told Benzinga that he has a couple of hundred million dollars invested in the cryptocurrency space, including holding Bitcoin on the SkyBridge and his own personal balance sheet.\n\nThe investor also partnered with FirstTrust to launch the FirstTrust SkyBridge Crypto Industry and Digital Economy ETF (NYSE: CRPT) in 2021.\n\nThe ETF “has publicly traded companies that are linked to digital assets,” Scaramucci said.\n\nA look at the top holdings shows the following five companies:\n\nMicroStrategy Inc (NYSE: MSTR): 23.9%\n\nCoinbase Global (NASDAQ: COIN): 21.2%\n\nRiot Platforms (NASDAQ: RIOT): 9.2%\n\nMarathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ: MARA): 8.4%\n\nGalaxy Digital Holdings (OTC: BRPHF): 7.4%\n\nRelated Link: Trump's Former Communication Director Casts Doubt On FTX's Revival\n\nWhat’s Next: Like other Bitcoin investors, Scaramucci is optimistic about the cryptocurrency's potential price surge, a sentiment that could be bolstered by future Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nScaramucci said that nobody knows where the price of Bitcoin is heading, but a look at SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE: GLD) ETF could illustrate what inflows into Bitcoin ETFs could do. Scaramucci highlighted that when investments poured into the gold ETF, gold's price rose. He suggests that as financial institutions venture into Bitcoin through ETFs, a similar trend might occur.\n\nIf Bitcoin ETFs do $100 billion in allocation to Bitcoin, the price of the cryptocurrency could go to $150,000 or $250,000, Scaramucci added.\n\n“I believe it could.”\n\nScaramucci mentioned many stocks that have gone up by 10x or more in the past and added that Bitcoin going to $150,000 to $250,000 is only a five to eight-bagger. “If I’m right, we could be sitting at $150k, $250k Bitcoin.”\n\nCatch the full episode of Anthony Scaramucci on The Raz Report Friday at 11 a.m. ET.\n\nRead Next: Exclusive: Mark Yusko On Bitcoin's Future, 2024 Price Target\n\nMeet and engage with transformative Digital Asset and Crypto business leaders and investors at Benzinga's exclusive event - Future of Digital Assets.

However, the Fed has since hiked interest rates once in July, following which cryptocurrencies took a hit once again. In fact, Bitcoin has been falling since hitting its 52-week high in early July.\n\nHowever, it has also solidified its position over the past few weeks and is now hovering around $26,900 after falling as much as $25,400 in late August and September.\n\nThe rebound has been taking place since the Fed kept its benchmark policy rate unchanged in its September FOMC meeting to its current range of 5.25-5.25%.\n\nA higher market interest rate has a negative impact on high-growth sectors such as technology, consumer discretionary and cryptocurrencies. The Fed’s aggressive monetary tightening policy has also raised worries that the economy might slip into a recession.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell, in his first post-FOMC comment, said that inflation remains elevated, which might require the central bank to hike interest rates by another 25 basis points before it starts cutting interest rates in 2024.\n\nFollowing Powell’s hawkish comments, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury Note surged to its highest level since 2007. The 10-year Treasury yield holds immense significance as it mirrors market participants' outlook on the nation's economic situation, influencing consumers, businesses and government entities.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, cryptocurrencies are once again trying to rebound from their recent lows as investors’ sentiments have been upbeat following dovish comments from a number of Fed officials. These officials believe that the recent tightening of credit conditions may make the central bank decide not to go for another interest rate hike in its November FOMC meeting.\n\nOur Choices\n\nNVIDIA Corporation NVDA is a major player in the semiconductor industry and has been one of the standout success stories of 2023.

The cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, is currently facing downward pressure as both assets have experienced a consistent decline in price over the past four days. Bitcoin has fallen below $27,000, while Ethereum is holding above the $1,550 level. Investor appetite for ether futures ETFs remains muted despite new listings, with six funds posting losses since their debut. Additionally, the market is awaiting regulatory approval for cryptocurrency spot ETFs, which could potentially impact market sentiment. Analysts are cautious about the current market conditions, with concerns about inflation, high Treasury yields, and uncertainty surrounding geopolitical events. Overall, the market trend appears bearish in the short term, with potential for further downside if key support levels are breached.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that there is a bearish trend in the ETH market, with a consistent decrease in open price, activity on the network, and a sell signal from the MACD indicator. The news analyst report highlights the growing popularity and potential long-term growth opportunities for Bitcoin, indicating a shift in market dynamics that could impact investor sentiment. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a cautious and conservative approach, prioritizing long-term strategies and risk management in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market.

Synthesizing these reports, it is clear that while there may be short-term fluctuations and uncertainties in the market, a long-term approach focused on capital preservation and informed decision-making is crucial. Despite the potential for further decrease in ETH price in the near future, the long-term growth opportunities for Bitcoin and the importance of managing risks appropriately suggest a conservative trading strategy is warranted.

Therefore, I would take a cautious approach and decide to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.7, indicating a moderate level of confidence in the bearish market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately for long-term profitability.
ACTION:
-0.7
DAILY RETURN:
-9.039953256584354e-05
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that ETH has been on a downward trend with decreasing open prices and a bearish MACD signal indicating a sell trend. The number of unique addresses has also been fluctuating, suggesting potential instability in the market. Additionally, the news analyst report highlights mixed sentiment towards Bitcoin and ETH, with regulatory pressure and market dynamics potentially impacting ETH's performance. However, a cautious and conservative approach based on long-term strategies and risk management has proven effective in navigating the volatile market.

Considering the conflicting signals from the reports and the importance of long-term strategies, it is prudent to adopt a conservative trading approach. While short-term gains may be tempting, prioritizing capital preservation and making informed decisions based on key indicators and external factors is crucial for long-term profitability. Therefore, the market trend for ETH is likely to continue being bearish in the near future, influenced by regulatory developments and investor sentiment towards Bitcoin.

Given the current market conditions and the emphasis on long-term strategies, I would take a cautious approach and sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.7. This decision reflects my understanding of the market trend and my strategic choice to manage risks appropriately for long-term profitability.
ACTION:
-0.7
DAILY RETURN:
-6.561796057502622e-05
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the market trend for ETH is bearish, with potential further price declines in the near future. The decreasing trend in unique addresses, coinbase transactions, and total transactions, along with the MACD signal consistently indicating a sell trend, all point towards a challenging market environment for ETH traders.

On the other hand, the news analyst report presents a mixed picture for the cryptocurrency market, with external factors impacting Bitcoin potentially leading to short-term volatility in the ETH market. However, the long-term outlook remains positive due to institutional interest and regulatory clarity evolving in the cryptocurrency space.

In reflection, a conservative approach based on long-term strategies and risk management has been effective in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. Key indicators such as the MACD signal and market sentiment towards Bitcoin have been crucial in informing trading decisions.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is clear that while short-term volatility may be expected, a long-term positive outlook for ETH remains. Therefore, it is advisable to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains to manage risks appropriately and maximize profitability.

Based on this analysis, my trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.5, reflecting a cautious approach towards the bearish market trend and the importance of capital preservation in uncertain market conditions.

The ethos and mentality of the members of early counter-culture groups like the cypherpunks and extropians laid the ideological foundation of the cultures we see thriving in Bitcoin today.\n\nThese same people also laid the technical foundations Bitcoin itself was built upon, through early attempts at digital cash systems like David Chaum’s ecash, to Wei Dai’s b-money.

The Times reported that the mining operation is linked to five different companies, with one company, Bit Origin Ltd., previously registered as a pork-processing company in the Cayman Islands.\n\nLi Jiaming, the president of Bit Origin Ltd., said that the Microsoft data center or the nearby military base had nothing to do with why the area was chosen. Instead, the mine was placed there because a local utility company agreed to work with Bit Origin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n"Even though we are a Microsoft neighbor and a couple of miles from the base, without power it is nothing — the business cannot succeed," Jiaming told the Times.\n\nOfficials who spoke with the Times cited concerns that the mines, which use an immense amount of electricity in their operations, would be used to purposefully overwhelm electrical grids to cause planned blackouts and complete other cyberattacks.'}, {'id': 29, 'time': 'Fri, 13 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "EXCLUSIVE: Scaramucci On What Warren Buffett Gets Wrong About Bitcoin, Doesn't Understand 'The Whole History Of ... - Nasdaq", 'content': "SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the digital asset space with a belief the price of assets such as Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) will go up.\n\nIn an exclusive interview, Scaramucci fought back against Bitcoin bears like Warren Buffett.\n\nWhat Happened: Legendary investor Buffett is best known as the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE: BRK-A)(NYSE: BRK-B), a conglomerate that owns many companies and invests in multiple public companies.\n\nFor those in the cryptocurrency space, Buffett is familiar as one of the biggest bears of Bitcoin, an asset he once famously called “rat poison squared.”\n\nScaramucci said the bear case by Buffett and others is that Bitcoin is just a cryptograph on the internet, worth nothing, shouldn’t have value and should be banned.\n\n“They really don’t understand the concept and the whole history of money,” Scaramucci said on a recent episode of “The Raz Report.”\n\nScaramucci said paper money is worthless by definition but we ascribe a value to it.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that ETH has been on a downward trend with decreasing open prices and a bearish MACD signal indicating a sell trend. The number of unique addresses has also been fluctuating, suggesting potential instability in the market. Additionally, the news analyst report highlights mixed sentiment towards Bitcoin and ETH, with regulatory pressure and market dynamics potentially impacting ETH's performance. However, a cautious and conservative approach based on long-term strategies and risk management has proven effective in navigating the volatile market.

Considering the conflicting signals from the reports and the importance of long-term strategies, it is prudent to adopt a conservative trading approach. While short-term gains may be tempting, prioritizing capital preservation and making informed decisions based on key indicators and external factors is crucial for long-term profitability. Therefore, the market trend for ETH is likely to continue being bearish in the near future, influenced by regulatory developments and investor sentiment towards Bitcoin.

Given the current market conditions and the emphasis on long-term strategies, I would take a cautious approach and sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.7. This decision reflects my understanding of the market trend and my strategic choice to manage risks appropriately for long-term profitability.

In reflection, a conservative approach based on long-term strategies and risk management has been effective in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. Key indicators such as the MACD signal and market sentiment towards Bitcoin have been crucial in informing trading decisions.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is clear that while short-term volatility may be expected, a long-term positive outlook for ETH remains. Therefore, it is advisable to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains to manage risks appropriately and maximize profitability.

Based on this analysis, my trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.5, reflecting a cautious approach towards the bearish market trend and the importance of capital preservation in uncertain market conditions.

Coinkite\n\nCoinkite has announced their latest product, Satslink. The under-production device sits at the intersection of many different areas of communications and mobile hardware, empowering developers to build a whole slew of different applications.\n\nRather than leaning on an opinionated framework, Satslink leverages open and flexible hardware enclosed by the Coldcard Q1’s exterior to bring variety and flexibility to developers. Those in possession of this device can choose what to do with it, and let their builder mentalities run wild on the many different possibilities the piece of hardware can offer.\n\nAt its core, Satslink is a peer-to-peer, hackable multi-purpose device. It features a secure element, as typical of Coinkite products, allowing the user to securely store private keys within the device. While it shares the external design with the Coldcard Q1, the internals are totally different from the company’s latest hardware wallet. Instead of focusing on air gapped security, the Satslink aims to bring secure communications to the day to day in ways that few would’ve considered possible.\n\n“Being dissatisfied with the connected and DIY options, we felt the need to create a better hot platform,” NVK, founder at Coinkite, told Bitcoin Magazine. “Bitcoin is expanding scripting/mpc options and we now have Nostr. Someone had to make a good connected and portable device for developers and enthusiast to create the next generation of freedom functionality.”\n\nSatslink leverages ESP32-S3, a low-power MCU-based system on a chip (SoC) with integrated 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy (Bluetooth LE). It consists of high-performance dual-core microprocessor (Xtensa® 32-bit LX7), a low power coprocessor, a Wi-Fi baseband, a Bluetooth LE baseband, RF module, and numerous peripherals. Satslink is programmed in micropython, with its source fully-available, and it is completely field upgradable with no locked-down ROM areas. Coinkite’s product also features a MicroSD slot for data transfer.\n\nSatslink seems to join together many different fields in bitcoin, technology and communications. Coinkite\n\n“The initial target is developers and enthusiasts,” NVK said. “But, because of the consumer friendly form factor, they will be able to start using anything the community creates. Like hot and sovereign lightning wallets and Nostr clients!”\n\nNostr, the open communications protocol that went viral after Block CEO and Twitter founder Jack Dorsey started endorsing and funding the project, is top of the list of possible use cases for Satslink. Given its peer-to-peer communication capabilities, Satslink can be used as a Nostr client, and since it can also work as a relay, one could send and receive messages as Nostr posts without those ever hitting the internet. Imagine a localized Nostr made up of many Satslink devices talking to each other through a sort of mesh network instead of the open web. That could be possible with this device.\n\nAnother interesting use case that many bitcoiners could relate to is having a sovereign controller for their home-based bitcoin stack. As some bitcoiners run bitcoin nodes and sometimes even self-hosted servers at home, one could program the Satslink to connect to their home stack on demand and perform desired actions remotely and securely given its networking capabilities. Satslink could be used to run a transaction coordinator, for instance, or be used as a whole wallet –– though Coinkite doesn’t recommend using the Satslink as your go-to cold storage solution for large bitcoin amounts.\n\nSatslink’s communication features also boast NFC and a QR code reader, enabling even more use cases for its eventual users. Notably, this combination paired with Satslink’s versatility and programmability could even be used to turn it into a hardware wallet of another manufacturer. Whether that’s desirable or not, truth is it could be possible to turn a Satslink into Blockstream’s JADE wallet or other similar DIY hardware wallets.\n\nWhile the possibilities are endless, what users actually build with this product remains to be seen. Coinkite’s device is currently available to preorder on the company’s website at a $189 price tag, and it is still unclear when the product will start shipping to buyers."}]

On Friday, Reuters reported the SEC opted against appealing an August court ruling that said its rejection of Grayscale\'s ETF proposal was "arbitrary and capricious."

You might even know someone who has invested in Bitcoin or one of the thousands of other ‘cryptos’ that exist. But has cryptocurrency and its blockchain technology fully landed in Europe?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nZug, a small Swiss canton nestled by a shimmering lake and framed by the Alps, is famous for its traditional cherry pie - which was particularly loved by actress Audrey Hepburn - and for its blockchain start-up hub.\n\nThere you may not be able to pay for your coffee in Bitcoin just yet, but you\'ll find yourself surrounded by folks working in crypto - who are actually able to pay their taxes in Bitcoin.\n\nIn this new episode of the Euronews Tech Talks podcast, we visit Zug, the heart of Europe\'s so-called "Crypto Valley", talk about trust in decentralised banking systems, and see how renewable energy sources are changing Bitcoin mining in Europe.\n\nCryptocurrency and blockchain companies have spread very quickly in the European area between Switzerland, Liechtenstein and northern Italy.\n\nAccording to recent research by CV VC, a Zug-based venture capital firm, there are more than 1,100 blockchain-related entities thriving between Switzerland, Liechtenstein and northern Italy.\n\nThese companies employ nearly 6,000 people and are worth a combined $185 billion, as of December 2022. That\'s more than the GDP of countries like Kuwait or Morocco.\n\nYet blockchain, the technology that underpins it, remains widely misunderstood and distrusted by Europeans.\n\nOver the next three episodes, the Euronews Tech Talks team will explore the world of blockchain from a European perspective to find answers to these questions: how is blockchain already impacting life in Europe? And will crypto ever become mainstream?\n\nBitcoin, the visible face of cryptocurrencies\n\nBitcoin, ether, tether, Dogecoin, Cardano. None of these terms existed before 2008, but over a decade later, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology are radically disrupting the world of finance.\n\nBitcoin is the most recognisable among them. It was created in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto. The name is a pseudonym for the mysterious person or persons who developed it. Blockchain, the technology behind cryptocurrency, has its roots as far back as 1991, when two scientists Stewart Haber and Scott Tanita, proposed a system to protect timestamps on documents from being interfered with.\n\nUnlike traditional currencies issued by central banks, Bitcoin is not controlled by any government or financial institution. It allows for peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries.\n\nBut blockchain technology goes beyond Bitcoin and crypto. In our next episode, we’ll feature a conversation between two experts who will tell us how it works with web3, smart contracts and NFTs.\n\nEuronews Tech Talks Podcast: Unravelling Europe\'s Digital Landscape\n\nIn our previous episodes, we delved into the world of generative AI from a European perspective.\n\nDo you want to know if software such as ChatGPT or Dall-e are already replacing the workforce in Europe or if we are facing a nuclear winter or a robotic paradise? You can listen to it here.'}, {'id': 6, 'time': 'Sun, 15 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Should You Buy Bitcoin While It's Below $30,000? - The Motley Fool", 'content': "While Bitcoin (BTC -2.89%) has soared more than 60% in value in 2023, it's still also more than 60% below its all-time high from November 2021. The current price sits at just around $26,750, pressured by higher interest rates and uncertain economic backdrop.\n\nWith this top cryptocurrency trading below $30,000 for the past 2 1/2 months, investors might be smart to take a closer look at adding Bitcoin to their portfolios. Here are some compelling reasons that's a good move.\n\nNear-term catalysts\n\nLooking out even 12 months from now, it's possible that Bitcoin's price will be significantly higher than today, which means buying it for less than $30,000 would look like a real steal in hindsight. Some powerful potential catalysts are on the horizon in the near term.\n\nEvery four or so years, Bitcoin undergoes what's called a halving. This is when the amount miners are rewarded for processing transactions gets cut in half, essentially reducing the rate at which new coins are created. Looking at past halving cycles shows us that Bitcoin could see major bullish sentiment. Between the last halving on May 11, 2020, to Bitcoin's all-time high, the price skyrocketed 661%.\n\nBasic economic theory can explain what's going on. If Bitcoin's supply of new issuance gets cut in half but demand remains steady or even rises, there is support for a higher price. The next halving is scheduled for April of next year.\n\nThe biggest news coming from the world of Bitcoin in the past several months has been that huge asset management firms have filed applications with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. While the SEC hasn't made any decisions yet, instead pushing back its deadlines, there is a lot of enthusiasm that these financial products will get approved.\n\nThe belief is that if this happens, the floodgates will open, introducing fresh capital -- and lots of it -- with a regulated, accessible, liquid, and easy way to gain exposure to Bitcoin. Should this happen, it could be viewed as a major milestone for Bitcoin, transforming it into a legitimate financial asset. And again, with higher demand, the price could soar.\n\nAnother catalyst, the most unpredictable, is the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. Since March 2022, the central bank has been on an aggressive path of hiking interest rates with the sole intention of getting inflation back to its 2% target. There might be one more rate hike before 2023 ends.\n\nHowever, I have the view that interest rates will have to come down sooner rather than later, mainly due to how much debt the government carries. Unless the government wants interest payments to keep taking up a sizable chunk of public spending, a looser monetary policy, characterized by lower interest rates, will need to happen.\n\nA more accommodative Fed is usually the key ingredient for a very favorable backdrop for risky assets, Bitcoin included. Investors will go further down the risk curve to achieve better returns. And this, again, can be a boon for Bitcoin's price.\n\nPatience is key\n\nThese near-term catalysts could be powerful price drivers for Bitcoin, but their potential positive impact is far from a sure thing. I'm always skeptical of price targets any Wall Street analyst, economist, or strategist comes up with. The world is inherently uncertain, with a million different variables that can affect the prices of financial assets.\n\nLet me be clear. If you are indeed bullish on Bitcoin, do not buy it hoping that it shoots up in value in 12 months. Instead, add it to your portfolio with the intention of owning it for the next decade. There's a good chance your patience will be rewarded."}, {'id': 12, 'time': 'Sun, 15 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Cathie Wood's Latest Bitcoin Insights: Is Now the Time to Buy? - The Motley Fool", 'content': 'Ark Invest, led by the visionary Chief Executive Officer Cathie Wood, has risen to prominence in recent years due to its innovation-centric investment strategies. Its priorities on assets with disruptive potential such as DNA sequencing, artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain technology make the firm a natural fan and notable advocate of Bitcoin (BTC -2.89%) thanks to its status as the most decentralized, secure, and valuable cryptocurrency.\n\nTo shed more light on Bitcoin, Ark publishes a comprehensive report every month delving into blockchain-based metrics, investor behavior trends, and macroeconomic factors, providing valuable context on the crypto\'s status and potential trajectory. In the firm\'s most recent report, for the month of September, several crucial insights and trends were highlighted, suggesting the path Bitcoin might take in the coming months.\n\nLong-term holders: A steadfast base\n\nOne of the key indicators emphasized in Ark\'s report is the remarkable rise in the percentage of long-term holders. Now at an all-time high, 76% of Bitcoin\'s total available supply hasn\'t moved in more than 155 days, the point at which short-term holders change to long term.\n\nThis time frame might seem arbitrary, but analytics firm Glassnode has found it to be a statistically significant benchmark as those who hold past 155 days are more likely to be smart-money investors and can provide insight into market sentiment.\n\nArk\'s analysts point out that this trend of an increasing number of long-term holders aligns with other transitional periods in Bitcoin\'s history, suggesting that this bear market might not be fundamentally different from previous ones.\n\nTypically, long-term holders enter the market in droves and pick up coins on the cheap, creating an accumulation phase usually associated with post-bear markets and early stages of bull markets. Moreover, the increase in long-term holders further reduces the digital currency\'s already scarce supply, potentially setting the stage for a significant price surge should a bull market return.\n\nMetrics suggest oversold conditions\n\nArk\'s embrace of innovation and admiration for Bitcoin extends beyond just an anecdotal report. The firm also creates unique metrics and indicators to assess its current position relative to past cycles. The latest report highlighted two specific statistics supporting Ark\'s stance that the cryptocurrency is currently trading at a relative discount.\n\nThe profit/loss ratio, comparing the number of coins transacted at a profit to those at a loss, currently hovers just above 1, indicating a decline in investor "exuberance" compared to earlier in the year, when Bitcoin\'s price jumped more than 80% in just five months. When reaching these levels in the past, the crypto was either in the depths of a bear market or clawing its way back into a bull market. Ark sees it as the latter.\n\nArk highlighted another crucial metric, the realized-profits-to-realized-cap ratio, which is currently at its lowest point since the beginning of the year, further indicating oversold conditions. This ratio measures profit-taking among Bitcoin investors against its realized cap, rather than the more commonly used market cap. Since realized cap is calculated by multiplying the last price at which every Bitcoin was transacted instead of valuing every coin at its current price, it offers a more sensitive and less misleading assessment than market cap.\n\nBy quantifying the amount of realized profits against Bitcoin\'s realized cap, Ark is able to measure buying and selling activity more clearly. Considering Bitcoin has historically entered the oversold territory of this ratio only seven times in its history, today could be an opportune moment for investors.\n\nThe macroeconomic landscape: Challenges and optimism\n\nArk\'s report doesn\'t shy away from acknowledging current unfavorable macroeconomic conditions and the potential challenges they pose to Bitcoin\'s bull market return. The prolonged interest rate hikes and tighter liquidity anticipated in markets globally could present hurdles for cryptocurrencies since typically these assets have thrived in environments with liquidity surpluses.\n\nHowever, despite short-term challenges, Ark remains bullish on Bitcoin in the long run. Its analysis suggests that the cryptocurrency\'s resiliency and favorable developments of on-chain metrics such as the number of active owners and mining difficulty, put it in a potentially lucrative position as it navigates the fine line between bear and bull markets.'}]

"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain, news, and reflection analyst reports, it is evident that the overall sentiment towards the ETH cryptocurrency market is bearish in the short term. The on-chain analysis indicates a downward trend in the market, with decreasing user activity and a consistent sell signal from the MACD indicator. The news report further supports this bearish sentiment, highlighting the downward pressure on both Bitcoin and Ethereum prices, as well as concerns about regulatory approval for cryptocurrency ETFs and geopolitical events.

In light of these reports, it is crucial to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains in order to navigate the current market conditions effectively. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a conservative trading approach, focusing on risk management and capital preservation. Given the bearish trend in the ETH market and the potential for further downside, it is prudent to adopt a cautious stance and make informed decisions based on key indicators and external factors.

Therefore, my trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.8.

Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is experiencing fluctuations in various key indicators such as open prices, unique addresses, coinbase transactions, average fees, and total value transferred. The mixed sentiment among traders indicated by the MACD signal suggests uncertainty and potential for further market fluctuations.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights growing optimism and potential catalysts for Bitcoin, which could potentially have a positive impact on the overall cryptocurrency market sentiment. The insights from Ark Invest also suggest oversold conditions and the potential for a significant price surge, indicating a bullish trend in the market.

Reflecting on the recent trading performance, it is evident that a conservative approach based on long-term strategies and risk management has been effective in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. Prioritizing information on market trends, regulatory developments, and institutional interest has been crucial for maximizing profitability in the long run.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is advisable to adopt a conservative trading approach and prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains. The market trend appears uncertain in the short term, but the overall sentiment is positive for potential long-term growth opportunities.

Therefore, my trading action would be to buy ETH with a confidence level of 0.5, indicating a moderate level of confidence in the potential long-term growth of the market while also acknowledging the short-term uncertainties and fluctuations. This decision aligns with the emphasis on capital preservation and cautious trading actions highlighted in the reflection analyst report.

But the coin quickly gave up those gains as that report was unable to be confirmed by major media. BlackRock told CNBC the iShares Bitcoin ETP application is still under review by the SEC. Sources close to the SEC said that Monday\'s report was not accurate.\n\nCryptocurrencies jumped to start the week as hopeful investors weighed the likelihood that the U.S. will finally see a bitcoin ETF in the coming months.\n\nIn recent trading, bitcoin rose about 5.28% to $28,454.17, according to Coin Metrics, while ether added 1.86% to trade at $1,589.10.\n\nLast week, bitcoin had jumped on Friday on news that the SEC would not appeal a ruling in Grayscale\'s lawsuit against regulators. In June of 2022, Grayscale sued the SEC over its denial of the company\'s application to convert the popular Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to an ETF.\n\n"The Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure\'s 45-day period to seek rehearing has now passed. The Court will now issue its final mandate within seven calendar days," a Grayscale spokeswoman told CNBC. "The Grayscale team remains operationally ready to convert GBTC to an ETF upon the SEC\'s approval, and we look forward to sharing more information as soon as practicable."\n\nIt\'s possible the SEC could again deny Grayscale\'s request, but the commission has recently been losing momentum in its attempt to broadly regulate crypto, with Grayscale in particular proving an obstacle. For example, the D.C. Court of Appeals called the SEC\'s denial "arbitrary and capricious." Many investors read Friday\'s news as a signal that the SEC could be close to allowing Grayscale to list GBTC shares.\n\n"Many people think the fact that the SEC chose to ask questions is a change of behavior and therefore I do think hopes are rising that a or a number of bitcoin ETFs will be approved," Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood said on CNBC\'s "Halftime Report" Monday.\n\nTo be sure, bitcoin is coming off its worst week since Aug. 18 and first negative week in six. It lost 4.35% for the week, closing at $26,755.66, according to Coin Metrics. Ether lost 6.36% for the week and ended the week at $1,544.24.\n\nBitcoin and ether may also be benefiting from worries about a recession, which has Paul Tudor Jones last week to Bernstein this morning touting bitcoin as a safe haven trade in an uncertain macroeconomy.\n\nStill, the price of bitcoin is under some pressure as the regulatory uncertainty in the U.S. crypto industry has investors apathetic about boosting their positions. As a result, the market has been plagued by low volume and liquidity and bitcoin has been unable to reach new highs above $30,000.\n\nThe optimism Monday morning lifted other crypto assets. Ripple\'s XRP and Binance Coin , the top coins by market cap behind bitcoin and ether excluding stablecoins, were higher by 1.77% and 2.42%, respectively. Smart contracts platform Solana\'s sol token was up 9% and Polygon\'s matic token added 2.8%.\n\nCrypto equities, which have also struggled recently, are outperforming crypto assets. On Monday morning Coinbase was higher by more than 2% in early trading. Mining stocks including Riot Platforms and Marathon Digital , were up about 5% across the board.\n\n— CNBC\'s Jesse Pound, Nick Wells and John Melloy contributed reporting.\n\nDon\'t miss these CNBC PRO stories:'}, {'id': 28, 'time': 'Mon, 16 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "A Bitcoin ETF is coming to the US. Here's what to expect when that happens - Yahoo Finance", 'content': 'Since its inception 15 years ago this month, Bitcoin has become the star around which the rest of the blockchain industry revolves. It remains the most widely known and best-understood project in the broader crypto ecosystem, and it continues to galvanize interest in digital currencies across the world.\n\nOne thing that unites all Bitcoin holders is trust in unchangeable code. Every day, the network’s miners convert real-world energy into a scarce digital asset that exists on an immutable public ledger. But one place where this trust has yet to take hold is traditional finance, where many big players are unwilling to hold Bitcoin outside of a familiar investment instrument.\n\nThere are any number of reasons for this state of affairs. Though the process of buying, storing, managing and transferring Bitcoin has gotten much simpler, it’s still easy to misplace private keys or send Bitcoin to the wrong address — to say nothing of persistent concerns regarding its regulatory prospects. Ultimately, what this means is that traders operating within institutions beholden to restrictive investment rules have effectively been locked out of a promising and potentially highly profitable new arena.\n\nThe most obvious solution to this problem would be an exchange-traded fund specializing in Bitcoin. An ETF is a basket of investments that can be traded on a stock exchange. A spot Bitcoin ETF, therefore, is effectively the same thing as making Bitcoin tradeable on such an exchange. While self-custody is preferable for some folks, this would furnish a straightforward way for other investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without needing to directly manage it themselves.\n\nAbsent an ETF, investors — particularly institutions that aren’t allowed to own Bitcoin directly — are limited to instruments like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. While GBTC indirectly grants exposure to Bitcoin, it doesn’t allow for immediate redemptions. This means that at various times it has traded at either sizable premiums or sizable discounts to Bitcoin, leading to incredibly inefficient cryptoasset markets. An ETF would allow many more investors to get direct exposure to Bitcoin, including major institutions that will bring an air of legitimacy to the broader digital asset space.\n\nStory continues\n\nHow close are we to a Bitcoin ETF in the United States? The short answer is: much closer than we were even a few months ago. The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington D.C. recently sided with Grayscale in its attempt to overrule the Securities and Exchange Commission’s denial of their earlier request to establish a Bitcoin ETF. A few months before that the largest asset management company in the world, BlackRock, submitted its own proposal for a Bitcoin ETF, with many other blue-chip institutions following suit. Outside of the U.S., recent efforts in this direction have included the introduction of Europe’s first spot Bitcoin ETF, along with multiple successful approvals of Bitcoin ETFs in Canada over the past two years.\n\nIn addition to various other legal and economic justifications, global analysts offer these two examples as proof of the inevitability of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. JPMorgan’s Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou recently stated that the SEC would either be forced to approve GBTC’s Bitcoin ETFs or would have to suffer the embarrassment of retroactively withdrawing a prior approval of similar ETFs based on futures contracts. Bloomberg’s James Seyffart, in addition, predicted that spot Bitcoin ETF approvals would be a “done deal” by 2024.\n\nAt this point, the destination is inevitable; how much longer it takes to get there remains to be seen.\n\nAs for the question of “why now,” two core reasons stand out as especially important. First, in a world marked by a growing distrust of authority, Bitcoin represents a comforting mathematical certainty. A core tenet of Bitcoin is that its supply is capped at 21 million, making it one of the only assets whose supply is completely unaffected by demand. Given that increasing Bitcoin’s supply ahead of its pre-programmed emissions schedule is impossible, the only way to address an increase in demand is to make it more accessible with instruments like ETFs.\n\nThe second reason stems from the fact that more and more people are building on top of the underlying Bitcoin network. Earlier this year, NFTs and fungible tokens were introduced to the Bitcoin blockchain, causing demand for network capacity to skyrocket. Though we’re no doubt in the early stages of these developments, they are nevertheless glimpses into a future where Bitcoin contributes to the governance of complex systems with uniquely credible neutrality.\n\nAs things stand, Bitcoin is now attempting to gain access to the traditional financial system, but there is the intriguing possibility that it will compete with that system in a much more fundamental way. Rather than an ETF being a basket through which investors hold Bitcoin, for example, “tokenization” — the issuance ...'}, {'id': 8, 'time': 'Mon, 16 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Fight to launch spot bitcoin ETF in the US passes another hurdle - Financial Times', 'content': 'Print this page\n\nThe long-running fight to launch a US exchange traded fund investing directly in bitcoin has passed another hurdle after the regulator declined to contest a court ruling made against it.\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission had until Friday to appeal against an August federal appeals court ruling that it had been wrong to reject an application from cryptocurrency house Grayscale Investments to convert its $16.7bn Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the world largest crypto fund, into an ETF.\n\nJudge Neomi Rao, writing for a three-judge panel, said the SEC had been “arbitrary and capricious” in failing to explain why it had rejected applications for “spot” bitcoin ETFs — which invest directly in the digital token — while giving the green light to ETFs trading in bitcoin futures contracts.\n\nInvestors reacted to the deadline passing for an SEC appeal by cutting GBTC’s discount to net asset value to about 14 per cent, according to Bloomberg, its narrowest margin since November 2021, having hit a record 48.9 per cent in December 2022. Bitcoin rose 3.7 per cent to $27,757 between Friday and noon UK time on Monday on the news, before spiking above $28,000 on unfounded reports that a rival BlackRock spot bitcoin ETF had been approved, a rumour later denied by both BlackRock and the SEC.\n\nGiven that the discount is expected to disappear entirely if the private trust is able to convert into an ETF, it is widely perceived as a barometer of investors’ expectations.\n\nTodd Rosenbluth, head of research at VettaFi, a consultancy said the SEC’s decision not to appeal suggested the future launch of spot bitcoin ETF looked more likely.\n\n“Combined with the regulator’s ongoing interactions with other asset managers seeking to launch a spot bitcoin ETF is a sign that a US spot bitcoin ETF is more likely to come to market in the near future. We could see new products trading in early 2024 after years of the SEC rejecting such plans.”\n\nGrayscale said it “remains operationally ready to convert GBTC to an ETF upon the SEC’s approval”.\n\nThe regulator had based its opposition to GBTC’s conversion on a view that bitcoin, which trades on unregulated exchanges, is prone to fraud and market manipulation, whereas bitcoin futures were an acceptable asset for a mainstream retail fund because they traded on regulated venues such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.\n\nThe SEC’s decision not to appeal against the ruling now leaves it with the option of opposing GBTC’s conversion on alternative grounds or ultimately approving it, which would seemingly open the floodgates to a wave of spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nAlongside Grayscale, 10 other managers, including BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, Fidelity, Ark Invest, WisdomTree, VanEck and Valkyrie, have outstanding filings in place to launch spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nSeveral of these applicants have amended their filings in recent days to say that their assets would be held in segregated accounts by their custodian and not commingled with either corporate or other customer assets.\n\nThe list of risk factors has also been extended in many cases. Ark, for instance, in its joint filing with 21Shares now refers to “the actual or perceived use of bitcoin and other digital assets in illicit transactions, which may adversely affect the bitcoin industry and an investment in the trust”.\n\nIt further says that “digital asset mining operations can consume significant amounts of electricity, which may have a negative environmental impact and give rise to public opinion against allowing, or government regulations restricting, the use of electricity for mining operations”.\n\nThe fact that many of the applicants have adopted additional wording has given rise to speculation that the SEC is actively engaging with them rather than planning to reject the filings outright, as it has done with every application for the past decade.\n\nBradley Duke, chief strategist at ETC Group, a provider of crypto exchange traded products, said that while it was possible the SEC might find another reason to oppose spot bitcoin ETFs “it’s becoming increasingly difficult for them to do that”.\n\n“More and more of the largest American financial services firms are opening up some sort of bitcoin or crypto-backed business,” Duke said, mentioning the likes of BlackRock, Fidelity and Charles Schwab.\n\n“There is a feeling of inevitability around crypto and a spot bitcoin ETF in the US,” he added, with Patrick McHenry, chair of the House Financial Services Committee, last month criticising the SEC’s “crusade against the digital assets ecosystem”, which he argued had caused “lasting damage”.\n\nSimilar exchange traded products already exist in Canada and Europe, where their advent has so far proved uncontentious.\n\n“We have had the equivalent of spot bitcoin ETFs in Europe for many years and they have traded well and efficiently with no problems,” Duke added.\n\nRosenbluth believed the SEC would be likely to follow the pattern it set with this month’...'}, {'id': 23, 'time': 'Mon, 16 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Bitcoin's Lightning Network Scaling Solution Seeks Resurgence After Losing Way - Yahoo Finance", 'content': '(Bloomberg) -- When Bitcoin development company Lightning Labs first launched the Lightning Network in 2018, it was all the rage. The protocol, built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, was designed to make cryptocurrency transactions faster and cheaper.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nAt the time, Lightning Labs had raised $2.5 million of seed financing from investors including Twitter’s Jack Dorsey and PayPal’s David Sacks, who dubbed it “the most important protocol being built on Bitcoin.”\n\nBut soon after launching, murmurs of failed transactions on the Lightning Network began popping up on X, and suddenly, the next big thing for Bitcoin seemed anything but. Users reported liquidity issues and security vulnerabilities, creating a perception that the Lightning Network was an over-complicated, unreliable protocol.\n\nRead More: The ‘Blockchain Trilemma’ That’s Holding Back Crypto: QuickTake\n\nAs the volume of activity on Bitcoin increases, transactions can become slower and costlier. The reason Bitcoin transactions take a while to process is the underlying technology, which ensures decentralization and security by recording each transaction on an encrypted chain.\n\nThe demand for so-called “Layer-2” scaling solutions like Lightning Network has only grown, but those for Bitcoin in particular, have struggled with capital constraints. About 99% of venture capital investments over the past few years flowed into other crypto products, not Bitcoin, according to a 2022 report by Trammell Venture Partners. Since its inception, Lightning Labs has raised $82.5 million in funding compared with one of Ethereum’s leading Layer-2 solutions, Polygon, which brought around $450 million in its latest funding round.\n\nStory continues\n\n“When the Bitcoin scaling wars were happening from 2015 to 2017, it was decided that Lightning Network was going to be the layered approach that Bitcoin would pursue,” Nic Carter, a partner at Castle Island Ventures, said in an interview. “But Bitcoin itself is a very difficult protocol to change. And whenever there has been change, it’s been highly contentious.”\n\nRead More: Technology Meant to Make Bitcoin Money Again Goes Live\n\nOn the Rise Again\n\nThe protocol was first proposed by Thaddeus Dryja and Joseph Poon in 2015 as a solution to Bitcoin’s scaling limitations. While traditional digital payment companies like Visa can process around 24,000 transactions per second, Bitcoin can only process seven. Lightning Network seemed to be on the path to change that.\n\n“Historically, Bitcoin has not been the place where venture capitalists tend to be focused,” Carter said. “The Bitcoin space is very ideological, and a lot of Bitcoiners have a negative view of venture capital.”\n\nEarlier this year, two of the largest crypto exchanges, Binance and Coinbase, announced their integration with Lightning Network, joining companies like Lightspark, a crypto startup which works on Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, and digital payments firm Strike.\n\nAlthough Coinbase was eying Lightning Network “for a long time,” the technology only recently reached a place the exchange company felt “a lot better about,” Viktor Bunin, who leads the Protocol Operations team at Coinbase, said in a recent interview on the Galaxy Brains podcast.\n\n“For many years Lighting has been quite challenging to use and run,” Bunin continued. “The non-custodial experience is still severely lacking relative to the custodial experience.”\n\nBut, as a company that is “unequivocally pro-Bitcoin,” Bunin adds, Lightning Network’s eventual integration only made sense for Coinbase.\n\nLightning Labs and Binance did not respond to a request for comment. Coinbase declined to comment.\n\nBitcoin rose about 2% to $27,760 on Monday in New York. That’s less than half the record high of almost $69,000 reached in November 2021.\n\n‘An Integral Step’\n\nLast year, Lightning Labs announced the creation of Taproot Assets, formerly known as Taro, a protocol that allows users to instantly transfer other digital currencies, like stablecoin and nonfungible tokens, on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nChristopher Calicott, managing director of Trammell Venture Partners, said Taproot Assets is an integral step to Lightning Network’s development, as wider adoption is one of the primary obstacles the Layer-2 solution faces. A 2022 report by Arcane Research said that more than 80 million people have access to Lightning Network.\n\nWhile Lightning Network theoretically has the capability to support one million transactions per second, its ability to reach that potential is dependent on its wide-scale usability. And as a peer-to-peer network, it’s difficult to gage how many transactions are happening at any given point, according to Graham Krizek, the founder & CEO of Voltage, a Lightning as a Service (LaaS) provider.\n\nRead More: Valor, Brevan Howard Back Lightning to ‘Bitcoinize the Dollar’\n\n“You’d have to ask everyone that’s using Lightning Network how many transactions they are doing, how frequently, all of t...'}]

After reviewing the on-chain, news, and reflection analyst reports, it is clear that the Ethereum (ETH) market is currently experiencing mixed signals. The on-chain data shows fluctuations in various metrics, indicating uncertainty in the market trend. However, there is a positive outlook in terms of growing interest and activity in the Ethereum network. The news analyst report suggests a positive sentiment in the broader cryptocurrency market, with optimism surrounding the potential approval of a Bitcoin ETF and advancements in scaling solutions.

Some experts are viewing this outcome as a watershed moment.\n\nIn October 2021, Grayscale announced it had filed with the SEC to convert its Bitcoin Trust into a Bitcoin Spot ETF “on the heels of the SEC’s clearance of a Bitcoin Futures ETF,” according to an announcement. The filing faced opposite from the SEC, however.\n\nIn August, in a highly anticipated decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the SEC’s decision.\n\n“The denial of Grayscale’s proposal was arbitrary and capricious because the Commission failed to explain its different treatment of similar products. We therefore grant Grayscale’s petition and vacate the order,” court documents read.\n\nA Grayscale spokeswoman indicated the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure’s 45-day period to seek rehearing has now passed.\n\n“The Court will now issue its final mandate within seven calendar days. The Grayscale team remains operationally ready to convert GBTC to an ETF upon the SEC’s approval, and we look forward to sharing more information as soon as practicable,” she added.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlso: 8 Best Cryptocurrencies To Invest In for 2023\n\nIs An Approval Likely To Arrive Soon?\n\nAccording to Thomas Hogan, former chief economist from the U.S. Senate Banking Committee and economist with the American Institute for Economic Research, although there has been no official word from the SEC, there are hints that the approval of a Bitcoin ETF is becoming more likely.\n\n“Major investment companies like BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, have joined the many firms filing applications for Bitcoin ETFs. Almost 100% of BlackRock’s previous ETF filings have been approved, so they probably would not have filed an application unless they thought approval was likely,” said Hogan.\n\nSeveral experts echoed the above sentiment, including Nihar Neelakanti, CEO and co-founder of Ecosapiens. Neelakanti said it seems an approval of a spot BTC ETF is actually right around the corner — and, at the latest, is poised to happen early next year.\n\n“There’s just too much political pressure placed on the SEC for it not to approve, especially when you think about what institutions are involved here, such as BlackRock and Vanguard,” said Neelakanti. “Legally, with courts having essentially weighed in in favor of Grayscale and its proposed ETF, it’s now almost impossible to resist an approval.”\n\nNeelakanti added that when an approval happens, we will see a wall of money flooding into the space.\n\n“We saw a hint of this when there was false news reported recently about an approval of the iShares BTC ETF,” said Neelakanti, referring to the erroneous news published earlier this week. “The price of BTC shot up 10% in seconds when that false approval news was reported. This tells me we will see something similar, and likely far more pronounced, when an actual approval happens.”\n\nWhat Would a Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval Mean for Investors?\n\nZachary Townsend, co-founder and CEO of Meanwhile, said the SEC’s deadline for appealing the decision around Greyscale’s ETF application passed a few days ago — that it’s less a matter of if it will be approved, but rather when.\n\nAnd when a spot BTC ETF is approved, he said he expects tens of billions of dollars to flow into Bitcoin and then, indirectly, the broader digital asset ecosystem.\n\n“So many investors are keen on getting exposure to Bitcoin, but they don’t want to go through the hassle of self-custody, which is difficult for even seasoned Bitcoiners,” said Townsend.\n\nIn turn, he added that an approved spot BTC ETF will provide that kind of investment vehicle for investors — and that such a vehicle will also make it far easier for investment advisors to advise their clients in getting BTC exposure via one of these approved ETFs.\n\n“There’s just a tremendous amount of passively invested money that is poised to go into these BTC products, which are likely going to be available for 401k-like investments and such,” he said. “The issue now is timing, and...'}, {'id': 35, 'time': 'Tue, 17 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'The secret life of Jimmy Zhong, who stole – and lost – more than $3 billion - CNBC', 'content': 'Athens, Georgia, is home to the University of Georgia, and the police there are used to college town-type crimes: break-ins, bar fights and assorted rowdiness. That kind of thing. But the 911 call that came in on the night of March 13, 2019, was unlike anything the Athens-Clarke County Police Department had ever encountered. On the phone was 28-year-old Jimmy Zhong, a local party boy and Georgia alum who frequented Athens\' drinking establishments. He wasn\'t like the other town rowdies – Zhong was also a computer expert who had an unusually robust digital home surveillance system. Now, he was calling to report a crime: hundreds of thousands of dollars in crypto currency that he said had been stolen from his home. Thinking of all that lost money, Zhong was distressed.\n\nIn March 2019, someone broke into Zhong\'s home, shattering the window. Source: Athens-Clarke County Police\n\n"I\'m having a panic attack," Zhong told the dispatcher, according to a recording obtained by CNBC. Zhong turned down the dispatcher\'s offer of an ambulance, and began trying to explain the situation. "I\'m an investor in bitcoin , which is like an online thing," he said. What happened next would bring an end to a nearly decade long manhunt and solve one of the biggest crimes of the crypto era. And it also would lead to the largest seizure of cryptocurrency from an individual in the history of the Department of Justice. Zhong\'s emergency call that winter evening sent investigators down a long digital trail that led back to the earliest days of bitcoin and revealed a dark truth about the universe of hackers and coders responsible for the creation of cryptocurrencies. It\'s a world where heroes and villains traded places and could even be the same people. None of it would go at all the way Zhong wanted. The 911 call didn\'t produce a suspect in the theft from Zhong\'s house. Athens police were dealing with one of their first crypto cases and unfamiliar with the shadowy underworld, and they failed to make progress in the case. So Zhong turned to local private investigator Robin Martinelli, who owns and operates Martinelli Investigations in nearby Loganville, Georgia.\n\nRobin Martinelli, Martinelli Investigations owner and private investigator. CNBC\n\nA former sheriff\'s deputy turned PI, Martinelli was far from an expert in crypto. She specialized in process serving, cheating spouses and custody investigations, the type of probes that once got her firm featured on an episode of "The Montel Williams Show." Martinelli had recently undergone surgery to amputate one leg, leaving her to conduct her surveillance operations with the help of a prosthetic. Still, she was motivated to solve Zhong\'s case. "When you wake up and don\'t put two feet on the ground, but you still have to run a company, you got to get out there and kick ass," Martinelli told CNBC in an interview for the new documentary, "Crypto 911: Exposing a Bitcoin Billionaire." She began by examining Zhong\'s robust surveillance video archive of his home. In looking at footage from the night of the crime, Martinelli spotted a slender male figure.\n\nSurveillance footage CNBC obtained captures someone breaking into Zhong\'s home in March 2019. Source: Athens-Clarke County Police\n\n"We could tell that they had like a hood on – a gray hood – but then they had almost like a black ski mask," Martinelli said. The suspect appeared to know his way around Zhong\'s house, which led Martinelli to believe that he was a friend or at least someone who had heard Zhong boast about his bitcoin stash. From the video, Martinelli was able to determine the suspect\'s height and even the size of his hands. She said she began her investigation by putting Zhong\'s friends under surveillance, following them to their homes and downtown bars on Broad Street and College Avenue. She put trackers on cars and scoured social media and conducted background checks. As she watched Zhong\'s bar friends come and go, Martinelli formed a low opinion of the group. She described them as "very, very casual, plastic, not really caring, maybe using Jimmy a little bit." Martinelli said Zhong appeared resistant to her theories, especially when they began to focus on his circle of friends. Martinelli eventually settled on one suspect in particular who she believed had stolen 150 bitcoins from Jimmy. At the time, that amount of the digital currency was worth nearly $600,000. Zhong didn\'t want to hear it, she said. "He would get upset when I would kind of mention somebody would had to have known where this cash was," Martinelli said. And she understood why Zhong was so hurt by the idea that someone close to him could have betrayed him. "Jimmy wanted to be loved," she said. "Jimmy wanted friends." Even as Martinelli soured on the friend group, she was warming up to her client, who she perceived as an odd man in search of friends. "Jimmy was a good guy," she said. A lot of people around Athens felt similarly about him. In the years before the theft, Zhong...'}]

Speaking on the condition of anonymity, U.S. government officials told The New York Times last week that they had been tracking the Wyoming operation for months.

On Monday, Oct 16, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) briefly crossed the $30,000 mark on reports that the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) approved BlackRock, Inc.’s BLK application to launch a BTC ETF. The news turned out to be a rumor.\n\n“The iShares Spot Bitcoin ETF application is still under review by the SEC,” a BlackRock spokesperson clarified. On this, the price of the benchmark crypto coin settled back down below $29000, falling sharply by about 8%. The SEC, too, gave a cryptic yet stern message on social media, stating, "Careful what you read on the internet. The best source of information about the SEC is the SEC."\n\nHowever, the sharp uptick in the price of Bitcoin on these rumors has started speculations that an actual approval may not be far off. The regulations body has been struggling in recent days to keep the rising optimism about Bitcoin ETFs at bay, and the best it has been able to do is to delay passing its verdict on various applications. Traditional finance giants seem to have decided to go mainstream with crypto, and the market appears prepared for it.\n\nOf late, the major development in this next-stage crypto move has been the Court of Appeals siding with Grayscale in its lawsuit against the SEC. Previously, the SEC had denied Grayscale’s application to convert its popular Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to an ETF. The SEC had until Friday to appeal the judge’s opinion that it had failed to provide a coherent explanation for its denial. But they did not take up that option in a significant act of omission. This will now pave the way for various companies from the traditional sector that are waiting for the SEC’s approval to jump into the crypto fray.\n\nStory continues\n\nApart from BlackRock, which is probably the biggest player in the race, the SEC is currently reviewing applications from major investment companies like Invesco Ltd.

Discussions about these predictions by Scaramucci could form a riveting part of the narrative as industry experts explore the potential future of cryptocurrencies.\n\nScaramucci postulates a bullish scenario for Bitcoin, attributing his confidence to the post-halving cycle which historically propels a surge in demand, in an interview with Altcoin Daily.\n\nHe states, “I believe six to 12 months after the halving cycle, there’s no reason why Bitcoin couldn’t be at $100,000. Just given what I know about demand and given what I know about the cycle and where the miners are, and so forth, plus, we may get some interest rate relief. That’s a 3x bump.”\n\nHis prediction reflects a tripling in Bitcoin’s value, which he analogizes to the technological advancements that have historically witnessed such price surges.\n\nWhile Scaramucci admits to not being as intimately acquainted with Ethereum, he nonetheless holds a positive stance.\n\nAlso Read: Fed Governor Michelle Bowman Says Creation Of US CBDC 'Could Pose Significant Risks'\n\nHighlighting the technological improvements and the increasing utility that Ethereum offers, he said, “Could Ethereum be $4,500 by then? Why not? You know it’s a great utility. Speeds have improved. The layer-2s have helped it. Why not? Why couldn’t it be $4,500? These things are maturing.”\n\nHis optimism extends to Algorand, albeit with a tempered tone due to its current trading price. Despite the crypto’s present modest trading range of around $0.09 to $0.10, Scaramucci sees potential for growth.\n\nHe envisions a path to $0.30 per token as Algorand continues to develop and garner adoption, especially from corporations enamored by its technology.\n\nHe adds, “I’m bullish. I thought at $1 it could have easily gotten to $5... but could Algorand from here... could it be a $0.30 token as they continue their development and continue the adoption of what they’re doing and bringing in corporations that love the technology?

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is experiencing fluctuations in various key indicators such as open prices, unique addresses, coinbase transactions, average fees, and total value transferred. The mixed sentiment among traders indicated by the MACD signal suggests uncertainty and potential for further market fluctuations.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights growing optimism and potential catalysts for Bitcoin, which could potentially have a positive impact on the overall cryptocurrency market sentiment. The insights from Ark Invest also suggest oversold conditions and the potential for a significant price surge, indicating a bullish trend in the market.

Reflecting on the recent trading performance, it is evident that a conservative approach based on long-term strategies and risk management has been effective in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. Prioritizing information on market trends, regulatory developments, and institutional interest has been crucial for maximizing profitability in the long run.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is advisable to adopt a conservative trading approach and prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains. The market trend appears uncertain in the short term, but the overall sentiment is positive for potential long-term growth opportunities.

Therefore, my trading action would be to buy ETH with a confidence level of 0.5, indicating a moderate level of confidence in the potential long-term growth of the market while also acknowledging the short-term uncertainties and fluctuations. This decision aligns with the emphasis on capital preservation and cautious trading actions highlighted in the reflection analyst report.
ACTION:
0.5
DAILY RETURN:
0.03686295268348383
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain, news, and reflection analyst reports, it is clear that the Ethereum (ETH) market is currently experiencing mixed signals. The on-chain data shows fluctuations in various metrics, indicating uncertainty in the market trend. However, there is a positive outlook in terms of growing interest and activity in the Ethereum network. The news analyst report suggests a positive sentiment in the broader cryptocurrency market, with optimism surrounding the potential approval of a Bitcoin ETF and advancements in scaling solutions.

In reflection, it is evident that a conservative approach based on long-term strategies and risk management has been effective in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. Given the mixed signals and uncertainties in the current market, a cautious trading strategy with a focus on long-term growth opportunities and risk management is recommended.

Therefore, I would take a conservative approach and maintain a neutral position in the market by holding onto my current ETH holdings. My trading action would be 0.0, reflecting my confidence in the market trend and my strategic decision to manage risk appropriately. By prioritizing long-term strategies over short-term gains, I aim to maximize profitability and navigate the uncertainties in the market effectively.

DAILY RETURN:

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that there are mixed signals in the ETH market. While there is growing interest and activity indicated by the increase in unique addresses and coinbase transactions, the fluctuating average fees and total value transferred suggest uncertainty. The MACD signal switching between buy and sell further adds to the ambiguity in market sentiment.

The news analyst report, on the other hand, paints a more positive picture for the cryptocurrency market, particularly for Bitcoin and Ethereum. The potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF and the overall bullish sentiment indicate a favorable outlook for both cryptocurrencies.

In reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a conservative approach based on long-term strategies and risk management has been effective in navigating the volatile market. Prioritizing information on market trends, regulatory developments, and institutional interest has been crucial for maximizing profitability in the long run.

Considering the mixed signals in the market and the emphasis on long-term strategies, it is advisable to take a cautious approach. While the news analyst report suggests a positive sentiment, the uncertainties highlighted in the on-chain analyst report call for a conservative trading strategy.

Therefore, I would take a slightly cautious approach and assign a trading action of 0.3, reflecting moderate confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately. This approach aligns with the emphasis on long-term growth opportunities and risk management highlighted in the reflection analyst report.

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain, news, and reflection analyst reports, it is clear that the Ethereum (ETH) market is currently experiencing mixed signals. The on-chain data shows fluctuations in various metrics, indicating uncertainty in the market trend. However, there is a positive outlook in terms of growing interest and activity in the Ethereum network. The news analyst report suggests a positive sentiment in the broader cryptocurrency market, with optimism surrounding the potential approval of a Bitcoin ETF and advancements in scaling solutions.

In reflection, it is evident that a conservative approach based on long-term strategies and risk management has been effective in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. Given the mixed signals and uncertainties in the current market, a cautious trading strategy with a focus on long-term growth opportunities and risk management is recommended.

Therefore, I would take a conservative approach and maintain a neutral position in the market by holding onto my current ETH holdings.

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that there is uncertainty in the ETH market with a possible bearish trend in the near future. The decrease in total transactions and unique addresses, along with the shifting MACD signal from buy to sell, indicate a potential reversal in the market trend. Additionally, the news analyst report highlights weakening demand for ETH compared to positive developments for XRP and BTC, suggesting a bearish short-term outlook for ETH.

In line with the reflection analyst report, a conservative approach focusing on long-term strategies and risk management is recommended in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. It is crucial to prioritize information on market trends, regulatory developments, and institutional interest to maximize profitability in the long run. Given the mixed signals in the market and the uncertainty surrounding ETH, a cautious trading strategy is advised.

Considering the synthesized reports and the emphasis on long-term growth opportunities and risk management, I would take a slightly conservative approach in my trading decision. Therefore, I would lean towards selling ETH to manage risk appropriately and potentially capitalize on the bearish trend in the short term. My trading action would be -0.5, reflecting moderate confidence in the market trend and my strategic decision to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains.

*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the ETH market is currently experiencing volatility with a possible downward trend in the near future. The mixed investor interest, varying transaction fees, and sell trend indicated by the MACD signal all point towards a cautious approach in trading ETH.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights positive developments in the cryptocurrency market, particularly with Bitcoin. The growing institutional interest and positive market trend for Bitcoin could potentially have a positive impact on other cryptocurrencies, including ETH.

Reflecting on the reports, it is clear that a cautious and conservative approach focusing on long-term strategies and risk management is crucial in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. By closely monitoring key indicators and market trends, informed trading decisions can be made to maximize profitability in the long run.

Considering the mixed signals in the market and the uncertainties present, a slightly conservative trading approach is warranted. Therefore, I would recommend a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately and prioritize long-term gains over short-term profits.

Based on the synthesized reports and the emphasis on long-term strategies, I would take a trading action with a confidence level of 0.3, indicating a slightly positive outlook on the market trend for ETH.

While Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) has seen a notable uptick this week, Vays is urging traders to tread cautiously.\n\nWhat Happened: Bitcoin experienced a 10% increase in value last week. However, Vays expressed reservations about its potential to sustain this momentum and hit the $32,000 mark.\n\nIn a YouTube video last week, he said, “Let’s not go crazy here. I still think there’ll be a pullback sometime in November. I don’t think this is rallying to $32,000.”\n\nVays predicted that Bitcoin would fall to around $28,000 before taking out the top of the range at $31,000 and rallying above $34,000.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $29,923.75, up 11 percent in the last seven days.\n\nTurning his attention to Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), Vays pointed out a potential double-bottom pattern forming against Bitcoin.\n\nAlso Read: Crypto Analyst Confident About Bitcoin\'s Surge, But There\'s A Catch\n\nHe predicted that Ethereum could face challenges ahead.\n\nHe stated, “Ethereum is making new lows against Bitcoin. This is not surprising. Ethereum is in a very critical support area… On a monthly scale, Ethereum still has significantly more downside. This is a very nasty double bottom. This is very bad for Ethereum. This sets up Ethereum to go significantly lower.”\n\nAt present, the ETH stands at 0.0543 BTC, equivalent to $1,608.\n\nSpeaking of Litecoin (CRYPTO: LTC), Vays anticipated a continued decline in its value relative to Bitcoin. Drawing from historical data post-LTC halving events, he said, "Litecoin is on its way to an 80% destruction. I’ve made this very clear many times. Every time Litecoin halves, the price of Litecoin goes down 80%. This happened after the Litecoin halving in 2015, after the Litecoin halving in 2019, and likely after the Litecoin halving in 2023. We’re down 30%. We need to go 80%.”\n\nAt the time of writing, LTC was trading at $64.16.\n\nNow Read: Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Bull Market Is On The Horizon: \'This Is The Beginning\'\n\nJoin Benzinga’s Fintech Deal Day & Awards on Nov. 13 and Future of Digital Assets on Nov. 14 in New York City to stay updated on trends like AI, regulations, SEC actions, and institutional adoption in the crypto space.

Here's why Warren Buffett remains a crypto hater - CNBC", 'content': 'Cryptocurrencies are on the rise again, helped by optimism surrounding the possible introduction of a spot bitcoin ETF. But no matter how strong this rally gets, it won\'t convince one of the industry\'s biggest critics — Warren Buffett. Bitcoin surged 10% over the past week, at one point briefly topping $30,000, as hopes grew that a spot bitcoin ETF will soon be approved. The idea among boosters is that such a vehicle would further legitimize the digital token and attract a wave of investment dollars, pushing the price of bitcoin even higher. But whether a bitcoin ETF soon becomes reality or not, it won\'t alter the Oracle of Omaha\'s thesis on cryptocurrencies, which is that they are highly speculative, non-productive assets. Buffett, who once famously called bitcoin "probably rat poison squared," has compared the bitcoin phenomenon to the tulip bulb mania in the Netherlands in the early 1600s . "All you\'re counting on is whether the next person is going to pay you more because they\'re even more excited about another next person coming along. But the asset itself is creating nothing," Buffett said in a 2018 CNBC interview. "It\'s been a very speculative, kind of Buck Rogers type thing, and people buy and sell them because they hope they go up or down just like they did with tulip bulbs a long time ago," said Buffett, Berkshire Halthaway\'s CEO. "If you just look at something and say that\'s magic, you can do it with shark teeth or seashells, or anything." Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger is an even a more vocal crypto hater, once saying digital currencies are a malicious combination of fraud and delusion, "good for kidnappers." Munger supports a ban of cryptocurrencies in the U.S. Wouldn’t buy ‘all of the bitcoin in the world’ for $25 Buffett believes that the digital token has no value because it doesn\'t deliver anything. Unlike farms, which produce food, and real estate, which produces rent, cryptocurrencies rely on market sentiment and supply-demand dynamics. "If you said … for a 1% interest in all the farmland in the United States, pay our group $25 billion, I\'ll write you a check this afternoon," Buffett said at Berkshire\'s 2022 annual meeting. "[For] $25 billion I now own 1% of the farmland. [If] you offer me 1% of all the apartment houses in the country and you want another $25 billion, I\'ll write you a check, it\'s very simple." "Now if you told me you own all of the bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25 I wouldn\'t take it because what would I do with it? I\'d have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn\'t going to do anything," he added. \'Not a currency\' The legendary, 93-year-old investor also said that bitcoin failed to meet the definition of a currency as its price fluctuates with the dollar. Crypto bulls tend to think bitcoin is a superior means of payment given its underlying, decentralized technology. "It is not a durable means of exchange. It\'s not a store of value," Buffett said in a 2014 CNBC interview. "People say \'well I\'ll sell you goods in bitcoins,\' but they change the price of those every time the price of the dollar changes.... they are pricing off the dollar."

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that there is uncertainty in the ETH market with a possible bearish trend in the near future. The decrease in total transactions and unique addresses, along with the shifting MACD signal from buy to sell, indicate a potential reversal in the market trend. Additionally, the news analyst report highlights weakening demand for ETH compared to positive developments for XRP and BTC, suggesting a bearish short-term outlook for ETH.

In line with the reflection analyst report, a conservative approach focusing on long-term strategies and risk management is recommended in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. It is crucial to prioritize information on market trends, regulatory developments, and institutional interest to maximize profitability in the long run. Given the mixed signals in the market and the uncertainty surrounding ETH, a cautious trading strategy is advised.

Considering the synthesized reports and the emphasis on long-term growth opportunities and risk management, I would take a slightly conservative approach in my trading decision. Therefore, I would lean towards selling ETH to manage risk appropriately and potentially capitalize on the bearish trend in the short term. My trading action would be -0.5, reflecting moderate confidence in the market trend and my strategic decision to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains.

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market has been experiencing price fluctuations and uncertainty, with mixed signals such as a potential increase in demand but a sell trend indicated by the MACD signal. On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights positive developments in the cryptocurrency market, particularly for Bitcoin and Ethereum, with optimism surrounding the approval of a Bitcoin ETF.

In reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a cautious and conservative approach is necessary in navigating the current market conditions. While there is potential for further price increases in the short term due to positive regulatory developments, the on-chain indicators suggest a level of uncertainty and potential for price fluctuations.

Considering the mixed signals and the need for a conservative approach, it is advisable to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains. By focusing on long-term growth opportunities and managing risk appropriately, traders can better position themselves to capitalize on potential market reversals.

Therefore, my trading action would be to buy ETH with a confidence level of 0.5. This decision reflects a balanced approach, taking into account the positive news developments while also acknowledging the uncertainty in the market highlighted by the on-chain indicators.

As it plans and executes more sophisticated sales worth hundreds of millions, bitcoiners consider its influence as a major whale.\n\nBy Landon Manning\n\nFrom years of various seizures and confiscations, the U.S. government has become one of the world’s largest holders of Bitcoin, with its 200k bitcoin worth more than $5 billion.\n\nThroughout the many years of Bitcoin’s ascendancy into a worldwide phenomenon, its millions of supporters have had extremely diverse backgrounds and viewpoints, even as they have all been united in the pursuit of a worldwide decentralized currency. Among this cohort, naturally, there have been a few criminals. Even now in October 2023, new details are still coming to light about the prosecution of Bitcoin-related crimes that took place more than a decade ago. Jimmy Zhong, who was finally sentenced to prison this year, was convicted of stealing some 50k bitcoin from the now-defunct Silk Road in 2012. The government has long since confiscated his bitcoin, but many of them essentially remained frozen as the legal battle proceeded. Obviously, during a decade, this bitcoin has accumulated tremendous value.\n\nIt must be remembered, however, that this particular example is one of many, and a very early one at that. Over the years, it has come to light that the federal government has accumulated a massive stockpile of bitcoin, approximately 200,000. It seems that the presence of red tape has been a surprising aid in profit for the government’s “investment”, as lengthy trials have only led to a complicated asset liquidation process. In short, it costs the government nothing to keep these bitcoin in the wallet of an incarcerated person, or else hold them directly, often for years at a time. All the while, growth for Bitcoin has been rocketing at unbelievable rates. Jared Koopman, executive director of the IRS’s cyber and forensics services section, denied any deliberate strategy when he claimed to the Wall Street Journal that “We don’t play the market. We basically are set by the timing in our process”.\n\nThat may be the case so far, but the way that the government has sought to profit off of this bitcoin has grown more sophisticated over the years. For example, federal agencies would initially sell these coins at an auction to interested buyers, selling confiscated coins tens of thousands at a time in 2014. However, since a pilot attempt by the Marshals Service in 2021, they have switched to directly selling on exchanges. Even as the government paid service fees that were derided as extortionary, it has still netted hundreds of millions from its repeated sales, with no sign of stopping. In a particular irony, one federal agency can even use an exchange to sell off these assets, while a different agency can open a lawsuit against it soon after! If this dynamic was abused, it could create a tidy revenue stream.\n\nIt’s in this light that the bitcoin community has been asking itself one question: What happens if the US government enters the space in a more major way? Obviously, federal agencies have no interest in practically adopting a currency that is in any way free of state control. El Salvador famously is the only world nation to accept bitcoin as legal tender, and part of the motivation for this move was explicitly to undermine the hegemony of the dollar. Although the United States may not believe in the mission of Bitcoin, it doesn’t change the fact that it is currently one of the largest whales in existence. And whales, historically, have had a tremendous impact on bitcoin’s price fluctuations.\n\nJust consider the state of the markets today, and a simple thought experiment. What would it look like if the federal government started acting more deliberately like a Bitcoin whale, maximizing its gains and attempting directly to influence the price of its assets? By making its liquidation process more sophisticated, it has already made the first step in becoming a robust bitcoin-selling machine. And the market these days is active and volatile, full of opportunities to act. For example, as bitcoin miners worldwide have been preparing for the next halving, Bitcoin’s hashrate has been exploding for more than a year. Even now, it continues to reach new heights of productivity.\n\nSource\n\nAll these miners have been preparing for the halving, consolidating and modernizing their equipment and facilities while even preparing political efforts. And in this ecosystem, the government has planned to sell off assets worth hundreds of billions. How many individuals controlling these sales would really be necessary to take some deliberate action? How difficult would it really be, when the halving sends shockwaves through the entire space, for a federal agency to make a few big sales that cause a crisis of confidence? Even if it sells at a loss relative to 2024’s prices, these will dwarf the massive gains...'}]

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
The recent surge in Bitcoin's price, surpassing $31,000, has been driven by optimism surrounding the potential approval of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) and the US federal government's significant holdings of Bitcoin. The approval of a Bitcoin ETF is expected to boost liquidity and trading volumes, while the government's sophisticated sales of its Bitcoin holdings could potentially impact price fluctuations. With these factors in play, the market trend for Bitcoin appears to be bullish, with the potential for further price increases as regulatory developments and government actions continue to influence the cryptocurrency's value.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market has been experiencing price fluctuations and uncertainty, with mixed signals such as a potential increase in demand but a sell trend indicated by the MACD signal. On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights positive developments in the cryptocurrency market, particularly for Bitcoin and Ethereum, with optimism surrounding the approval of a Bitcoin ETF.

In reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a cautious and conservative approach is necessary in navigating the current market conditions. While there is potential for further price increases in the short term due to positive regulatory developments, the on-chain indicators suggest a level of uncertainty and potential for price fluctuations.

Considering the mixed signals and the need for a conservative approach, it is advisable to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains. By focusing on long-term growth opportunities and managing risk appropriately, traders can better position themselves to capitalize on potential market reversals.

Therefore, my trading action would be to buy ETH with a confidence level of 0.5. This decision reflects a balanced approach, taking into account the positive news developments while also acknowledging the uncertainty in the market highlighted by the on-chain indicators. By maintaining a slightly conservative stance and prioritizing long-term growth, I aim to maximize profitability and manage risk effectively in the volatile cryptocurrency market.
ACTION:

DAILY RETURN:
0.004618796118228685
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the ETH market is currently experiencing volatility with a possible downward trend in the near future. The mixed investor interest, varying transaction fees, and sell trend indicated by the MACD signal all point towards a cautious approach in trading ETH.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights positive developments in the cryptocurrency market, particularly with Bitcoin. The growing institutional interest and positive market trend for Bitcoin could potentially have a positive impact on other cryptocurrencies, including ETH.

Reflecting on the reports, it is clear that a cautious and conservative approach focusing on long-term strategies and risk management is crucial in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. By closely monitoring key indicators and market trends, informed trading decisions can be made to maximize profitability in the long run.

Considering the mixed signals in the market and the uncertainties present, a slightly conservative trading approach is warranted. Therefore, I would recommend a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately and prioritize long-term gains over short-term profits.

Based on the synthesized reports and the emphasis on long-term strategies, I would take a trading action with a confidence level of 0.3, indicating a slightly positive outlook on the market trend for ETH.
ACTION:
0.3
DAILY RETURN:

REASONING:
After reviewing the provided reports, it is clear that the overall sentiment is bearish for the ETH cryptocurrency in the short term. The on-chain analyst report highlights a downward trend in ETH's open price, decreasing user activity, and uncertainty in market participation. The news analyst report further supports this bearish outlook, with caution from analysts regarding potential pullbacks in the market and skepticism from traditional investors like Warren Buffett. However, there are also mentions of long-term growth opportunities, particularly in mining technology innovations.

In light of these reports, it is advisable to adopt a slightly conservative trading approach that prioritizes long-term strategies over short-term gains. By focusing on risk management and monitoring key indicators such as on-chain data, MACD signals, and news developments, traders can make informed decisions to navigate the volatile cryptocurrency market effectively.

Considering the mixed signals in the market and the uncertainties present, I would recommend a trading action of -0.5, reflecting a moderate level of confidence in the bearish trend for ETH in the short term. This decision aligns with the emphasis on long-term strategies and risk management to maximize profitability and navigate the evolving cryptocurrency market successfully.

Major institutions would now have a buy-in into the sector,” he added.\n\nCrypto advocates have said such funds offer consumers a cheap and safe way to trade the token, instead of buying it directly from unregulated crypto exchanges.\n\nThe SEC has argued that it cannot offer investors reassurance that the bitcoin market is not prone to being manipulated.\n\nHowever, the regulator has been under pressure since the summer after a Washington court ruled the agency was wrong to reject an application by asset manager Grayscale to turn its flagship vehicle, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, into an ETF.\n\nTraders said Tuesday’s gains were driven by the listing of BlackRock’s planned bitcoin ETF at the US securities market’s main clearing house.\n\nIt came days after an updated filing from BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, which said that an unnamed investor planned to buy shares in the ETF. The move is common for new or upcoming ETFs in search of fresh capital.\n\n“Every day, we get news further solidifying the common consensus that the SEC will approve the variety of bitcoin spot ETFs,” said Michael Silberberg, head of investor relations at Alt Tab Capital.\n\nTraders have been positioning themselves for a jump in bitcoin price if an ETF is approved. Earlier this month it rose by more than 8 per cent as false rumours circulated on social media that BlackRock’s application had been approved.\n\nCoinShares, an investment group, said that investors had put $179mn into digital asset funds over the past four weeks and were “likely linked to excitement” over a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nHowever, it noted the flows were below the $807mn that flowed into funds in the four weeks after BlackRock made its first filing last June. It suggests “a more cautious approach from investors this time around,” it said in a research note.\n\nThe SEC is due to make its first rulings on the ETF filings at the start of next year.'}, {'id': 25, 'time': 'Tue, 24 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Bitcoin surged above $35,000 to highest level since 2022 - Yahoo Finance', 'content': 'Bitcoin (BTC-USD) surged above $35,000 in its largest single-day jump in 13 months, fueled by optimism that regulatory approval of the first spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund is nearing.\n\nThe world’s largest cryptocurrency moved up more than 10% Monday, its biggest increase over a 24-hour period since September 2022.

Coinbase (COIN), the largest US crypto exchange, opened 13% higher Tuesday while MicroStrategy (MSTR) rose 12%. Bitcoin mining firms Riot Platforms (RIOT) and Marathon Digital (MARA) surged more than 13% and 17%, respectively.\n\nThe rally appeared to be driven partly by speculation that the Securities and Exchange Commission was close to granting approval for a spot bitcoin ETF, which would allow investors to get exposure to the cryptocurrency without having to own it.\n\nBlackRock (BLK) is among the money managers that have recently applied to launch such a product.\n\nThe BlackRock logo is pictured outside the money manager\'s headquarters in Manhattan.

It "is not indicative of an outcome for any outstanding regulatory or other approval processes," they added.\n\nSpeculation about BlackRock also drove prices higher last week when a rumor circulated that the SEC had granted its approval for the spot bitcoin ETF.

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
The recent surge in Bitcoin's price to over $35,000, driven by optimism surrounding the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has sparked a wave of positive sentiment in the cryptocurrency market. This surge, fueled by a combination of short liquidations, speculation on ETF approvals, and increased institutional interest, has led to a significant increase in Bitcoin's value and has also positively impacted related digital asset companies like Coinbase and MicroStrategy. If the SEC does approve the spot Bitcoin ETFs, it could further validate Bitcoin as an established asset class and attract more institutional investors into the market, potentially leading to a continued bullish trend in the cryptocurrency market.

"""
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the ETH market is currently experiencing volatility with a possible downward trend in the near future. The mixed investor interest, varying transaction fees, and sell trend indicated by the MACD signal all point towards a cautious approach in trading ETH.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights positive developments in the cryptocurrency market, particularly with Bitcoin. The growing institutional interest and positive market trend for Bitcoin could potentially have a positive impact on other cryptocurrencies, including ETH.

Reflecting on the reports, it is clear that a cautious and conservative approach focusing on long-term strategies and risk management is crucial in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. By closely monitoring key indicators and market trends, informed trading decisions can be made to maximize profitability in the long run.

Considering the mixed signals in the market and the uncertainties present, a slightly conservative trading approach is warranted. Therefore, I would recommend a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately and prioritize long-term gains over short-term profits.

Based on the synthesized reports and the emphasis on long-term strategies, I would take a trading action with a confidence level of 0.3, indicating a slightly positive outlook on the market trend for ETH.

After reviewing the provided reports, it is clear that the overall sentiment is bearish for the ETH cryptocurrency in the short term. The on-chain analyst report highlights a downward trend in ETH's open price, decreasing user activity, and uncertainty in market participation.

Despite some spectacular scams, crypto is here to stay and many incredible projects that will solve real problems are currently being built.\n\nThus, crypto investors are bound to continue to search for “the next Bitcoin.” To find those returns look for utility and integration into the wider financial system. That’s the key.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nQuant (QNT-USD)\n\nThe logo for the Quant cryptocurrency network is displayed in white on a black background.\n\nSource: Zeedign.com / Shutterstock.com\n\nQuant (QNT-USD) has defined utility as the focal point of its development. It is working to facilitate interoperability between multiple blockchains. In essence, Quant connects individual blockchains through decentralized applications (dApps). dApps are Web 3.0 apps in a sense and allow users to interface with blockchains. Quant is facilitating a big idea that’s difficult to fathom completely but remains one that is hugely important nonetheless.\n\nAnother thing to note about Quant and the other cryptos listed below is that all are ISO 20022 compliant. ISO 20022 is a global standardization body that governs commercial and industrial standards. In this case, those related to financial system integration. By 2025, all financial institutions must be able to process ISO compliant payment transactions. Quant is going to be mainstream and investors should realize that and act accordingly.\n\nInteroperability is the name of the game. Cryptocurrency is still in its Wild West phase but ISO 20022 compliance and integration will bring those that meet the standard into the mainstream of finance.\n\nHedera (HBAR-USD)\n\nConcept tokens for Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) on a black keyboard.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nHedera (HBAR-USD) has established an important first-mover advantage that makes it part of the conversation to identify the next Bitcoin. It has become deeply associated with enterprise utility. Corporations moved into crypto during the pandemic to varying degrees and continue to integrate crypto today. Hedera is among the first names that enterprises will think of as crypto opportunities increase. When it comes time to add functionality, Hedera has that opportunity because it laid the groundwork.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt is also ISO 20022 compliant which only strengthens that narrative. Larger financial institutions are developing crypto businesses in house. Hedera may not have a great opportunity to break into those enterprises. However, SMEs don’t have as many resources as the big banks do. Sooner or later, they’re going to seek crypto integration and functionality en masse. That is among the best reasons to invest in Hedera overall. The project is preparing for fintech opportunities that are being established by the day. Hedera’s ISO 20022 compliance is a crystal clear example of its goals and direction and shouldn’t be ignored.\n\nCardano (ADA-USD)\n\nCardano crypto logo\n\nSource: RuskaDesign / Shutterstock.com\n\nCardano (ADA-USD) has also ticked the ISO 20022 compliance box. Cardano is being developed with the goal of long-term success as its primary purpose. Long-term success means a reliance on computer science and empirical evidence to guide its development. Unsexy stuff at its heart. Perhaps that’s why Cardano doesn’t get much attention overall. It’s the polar opposite of meme coin nonsense and aims to build utility first and foremost.\n\nIt’s easy to imagine that the developers at Cardano understand that the game is really about wider integration. Cardano, and any other long-term winners, are going to win by being part of the evolution of money. That means development ultimately is evolution and integration into the financial system, not a wholesale replacing of the financial system. I’m sure that the empirical evidence draws similar conclusions. Cardano is sure to listen and that’s why it’s got a great chance of winning in the long term.\n\nIt may not exactly fit the ideal frame of “the next Bitcoin” in that Cardano’s value can’t realistically increase to $28k. It currently trades for less than 30 cents. However, it does have the potential to grow over the next decade like Bitcoin did from 2010-2020.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

That’s the dogma driving expectations for a U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). If only the industry’s bogeymen at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would approve that one application, approvals will snowball, institutional cash will flood in, and all will be right in the world of the blockchain.\n\nThat goal appeared to edge a step closer Monday. The SEC confirmed it will not contest a court decision in favor of digital asset investment firm Grayscale’s right to convert its GBTC (Grayscale Bitcoin Trust) into a spot Bitcoin ETF. Bitcoin was up over 19% for the past seven days on the back of the news, sitting above the US$34,000 support level as of 2.30 p.m. Wednesday in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data. The coin briefly broke US$35,000 during Tuesday trading, its highest level since May 2022.\n\nA Grayscale spokesperson said that the company now hopes to “work constructively” with the SEC on its efforts to convert GBTC — currently the world’s largest cryptocurrency fund with US$16.7 billion in assets under management — into a spot Bitcoin ETF. “GBTC is operationally ready, and we intend to move as expeditiously as possible on behalf of our investors,” the spokesperson said.\n\nBut it’s not just Grayscale investors who are waiting for a U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF. The financial instrument — which would allow investors a way to invest in the coin on a traditional exchange — is seen as a way to open up the still marginal world of crypto investment to traditional finance.\n\n“You’re going to have a lot of people getting into crypto by the way of an ETF,” said Jack Jia, head of crypto at payment platform Unlimit. He said the primary benefit of a spot Bitcoin ETF is that it improves the user experience (UX) for would-be crypto investors.\n\n“They won’t need to use account abstraction or a custodial wallet because their UX is their broker,” Jia added. “They’re telling their customers or their clients to buy Bitcoin. So that is going to be the onboarding process, if you will.”\n\nStory continues\n\nOther than Grayscale, a range of institutional investors, from BlackRock to Fidelity to Ark Invest, have applied to the SEC for permission to create a spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S., the world’s largest economy. The SEC has so far either rejected or delayed making a decision on the applications, citing fears about a lack of liquidity and price manipulation in crypto markets.\n\nBut Vivian Fang, a FinTech expert and professor of finance at Indiana University, said she sees various signs that the SEC is now “warming up” to the idea of approving a spot Bitcoin ETF. She pointed to recent comments coming out of the regulator that it now considers the Bitcoin market to be of a sufficient size to resist market manipulation.\n\nThis, Fang said, has made her feel “cautiously optimistic” that the SEC will approve at least one spot Bitcoin ETF application by the end of this year.\n\nBullish behavior\n\nAccording to research released Oct. 16 by blockchain data firm CryptoQuant, an SEC decision to allow the creation of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the seven largest asset managers with pending applications could bring up to US$155 billion into the Bitcoin market. Based on their analysis of the coin’s past bull run behavior, CryptoQuant calculated that would increase Bitcoin’s market capitalization by US$450 billion to US$900 billion, adding US$1 trillion to the wider crypto market along the way.\n\nThe Next Wave of #Bitcoin Institutional Adoption:\n\nThe Launch of Spot ETFs\n\n\n\n– SPOT ETFS AS THE NEW WAY OF INSTITUTIONAL ADOPTION.\n\n– IMPLICATIONS OF ETF APPROVALS FOR BITCOIN MARKET CAPITALIZATION.\n\n\n\nPrepared by Our Head of Research, @jjcmoreno.\n\n\n\nLink👇https://t.co/dKyd5GJJdT pic.twitter.com/ECEWMpkf0g — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) October 16, 2023\n\nThe crypto market has, over the past week in particular, shown a wholehearted desire to buy into that narrative. Crypto media picked up on a social media post Oct. 16 saying the SEC had approved BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF application. The crypto market blew up. The price of Bitcoin soared nearly 10%, rising to around US$30,000 before falling back down to the US$28,000 range.\n\nThe news, it turned out, was fake. Regardless, there was around US$100 million in BTC liquidations in the first 30 minutes following the story. Cointelegraph, the media organization that first reported on the misleading post, issued a clarification statement apologizing for the error. But the damage — or the improvement, depending on which way you look at it — was done.\n\nWhether or not the original post was a legitimate attempt to manipulate the market or simply a prank gone too far, the fake news attracted a flood of interest and mainstream media attention to the ongoing ETF discussion.\n\nBlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink, once a vocal skeptic of the crypto industry, appeared on a Fox Business broadcast, saying that the Bitcoin price rally to US$30,000 was more ...'}]

"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the provided reports, it is clear that the overall sentiment is bearish for the ETH cryptocurrency in the short term. The on-chain analyst report highlights a downward trend in ETH's open price, decreasing user activity, and uncertainty in market participation. The news analyst report further supports this bearish outlook, with caution from analysts regarding potential pullbacks in the market and skepticism from traditional investors like Warren Buffett. However, there are also mentions of long-term growth opportunities, particularly in mining technology innovations.

In light of these reports, it is advisable to adopt a slightly conservative trading approach that prioritizes long-term strategies over short-term gains. By focusing on risk management and monitoring key indicators such as on-chain data, MACD signals, and news developments, traders can make informed decisions to navigate the volatile cryptocurrency market effectively.

Considering the mixed signals in the market and the uncertainties present, I would recommend a trading action of -0.5, reflecting a moderate level of confidence in the bearish trend for ETH in the short term. This decision aligns with the emphasis on long-term strategies and risk management to maximize profitability and navigate the evolving cryptocurrency market successfully.

These factors are expected to boost liquidity and trading volumes, leading to further price increases in the market.

In reflecting on the recent trading performance, it is clear that a cautious and slightly conservative approach has been effective in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. Prioritizing long-term strategies over short-term gains, while closely monitoring key indicators and news developments, has been crucial in maximizing profitability.

Considering the mixed signals from the reports, it is important to prioritize long-term growth opportunities and manage risk appropriately.

Key indicators such as on-chain data, MACD signals, and news developments have played a crucial role in making informed trading decisions. Given the mixed signals in the market, it is important to prioritize risk management and strategic decision-making to maximize profitability and navigate uncertainties effectively.

With the next halving, the reward will be cut from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block.\n\nAs Bitcoin's supply growth slows while demand rises, its dominance increases. Bitcoin maintained over 80% dominance in the 2017 bull market, but it fell to the 50-60% range in the 2021 bull run.\n\nNow, ETF excitement and the halving event have brought its dominance back up to 54%, the highest level since April 2021. The rise coincided with Bitcoin rallying above $30,000 amid news of a potential spot Bitcoin ETF approval in the US.\n\nNoelle Acheson, a market analyst, says Bitcoin's safe-haven appeal and ETF momentum have helped boost its dominance over altcoins like ether. She notes Bitcoin tends to lead in early market cycles before investors get more comfortable with higher-risk assets.\n\nWith Bitcoin beating most altcoins in recent performance, its bullish momentum could signal an eventual altcoin rally once money begins flowing from Bitcoin into other crypto assets. For now, its dominance reflects its strength as the crypto market awaits the next major catalyst."}, {'id': 42, 'time': 'Thu, 26 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Should You Buy Coinbase Stock on Higher Bitcoin Prices? - Nasdaq', 'content': "Valued at $18.45 billion by market cap, Coinbase Global (COIN) is among the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. Coinbase went public in 2021, and currently trades 79% below all-time highs.\n\nHowever, COIN has staged a remarkable comeback year-to-date, rising 114% in the first 10 months of 2023 - with recent gains fueled by fresh regulatory optimism for cryptocurrencies.\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nMeanwhile, with none other than fund manager Cathie Wood taking advantage of the recent rally to unload her shares, let’s see whether Coinbase stock is worth buying on the latest headlines.\n\nCoinbase Stock Lags Bitcoin's Price Surge\n\nThe performance of Coinbase is closely tied to key cryptocurrency asset prices, such as Bitcoin (BTCUSD) and Ethereum (ETHUSD), which account for a majority of the exchange's trading volumes. Generally, trading volumes are higher in a bull market, allowing Coinbase to benefit from higher fees and commissions. Alternatively, volumes drop when sentiment turns bearish, resulting in lower revenue.\n\nFor instance, Coinbase increased sales from $533.7 million in 2019 to $7.83 billion in 2021 as cryptocurrency prices exploded higher. But in the last 12 months, its sales have fallen to $2.7 billion, with Bitcoin currently trading about 50% below all-time highs.\n\nA key driver for the recent rally to 18-month highs in Bitcoin is investor optimism over the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF. The long-awaited approval of Grayscale's fund could clear the way for more listings from large asset management companies, including BlackRock (BLK) and Invesco (IVZ) - which potentially opens the floodgates for billions more investor dollars to pour into the sector.\n\nHowever, investors should note that COIN is hardly a perfect proxy for Bitcoin prices, despite its dependence on the volatile market. Over the last three months, COIN is down 24%, while BTC is up 15%. And in the last month alone, COIN's 7% gain significantly lags a nearly 30% rise in BTC.\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nCoinbase Stock: Looking Beyond Bitcoin\n\nTo its credit, Coinbase has expanded its portfolio of products and solutions over the past two years, enabling it to expand its ecosystem significantly and reduce its dependency on volatile crypto trading volumes. For instance, in 2021, the company’s transaction revenue accounted for 87% of sales. In Q2 of 2023, transaction sales accounted for less than 50% of total revenue.\n\nIn particular, Coinbase is banking on its subscription and services business to gain traction. This segment includes products such as interest income, custodial fees, staking, and blockchain rewards. Revenue in its subscription and services business grew from just $45 million in 2020 to $792 million in 2023. In Q2, subscription sales more than doubled to $335.4 million.\n\nBut for Coinbase to remain a solid long-term investment option, Bitcoin will have to gain widespread adoption globally. Bitcoin was built to replace fiat currencies and facilitate global transactions at a low cost. However, the lack of regulatory clarity has remained a significant headwind - which is why crypto-related investments reacted so strongly to recent indications of a potential SEC victory.\n\nAnalysts Call COIN a Hold\n\nCoinbase enjoys a first-mover advantage and is forecast to end 2023 with sales of $2.78 billion, while adjusted earnings are forecast at $1.73 per share. That said, COIN trades at 6.7x forward sales, which is quite steep for an unprofitable company that's projected to report steeper losses into the next fiscal year.\n\nOut of the 22 analysts covering Coinbase stock, the average recommendation is a “hold.” Six recommend “strong buy,” one recommends “moderate buy,” eight recommend “hold,” two recommend “moderate sell,” and five recommend “strong sell.” The average target price for COIN is $83.84, which is 12.5% above the current trading price.\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nOn the date of publication, Aditya Raghunath did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

The cryptocurrency jumped nearly 6% to $34,872 to hit its highest level in almost one-and-a-half years on growing speculation that Blackrock’s spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) will soon be a reality.\n\nTuesday’s rally followed a 10% surge in Bitcoin on Oct 23, when it crossed the $35,000 mark. The enthusiasm surrounding Bitcoin sent other related stocks and major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) on a rally. Ethereum prices jumped 4.5% on Oct 23 to $1,786.30, hitting its highest level since August.\n\nInvestors Optimist about Bitcoin ETF\n\nThe approval of a Bitcoin-backed exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to boost demand as it would enable more conservative investors to own Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies via traditional stock markets.\n\nThe approval is also likely to attract new investments into the crypto sector, which could further boost demand.\n\nCryptocurrencies made a solid rebound in 2023 after suffering majorly last year as the Federal Reserve launched an aggressive monetary tightening campaign to curb multi-decade high inflation, which saw the central bank hiking interest rates by 525 basis points since March 2022.\n\nMoreover, a couple of unfortunate events, the Terra Luna crash and a major fraud leading to the bankruptcy of FTX, saw a slump in the crypto market.\n\nCryptocurrencies staged a solid rebound this year, with Bitcoin hitting $31,000 in early July before the rally came to a halt. Bitcoin price has since been rangebound and hovering around the $25,000 mark as investors struggled to gauge the Fed’s next move with its interest rate hike policy.\n\nHowever, renewed optimism among investors sent Bitcoin prices up last week after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decided not to appeal its loss against Grayscale Investments in the D.C.

Earlier this week bitcoin climbed as high as $35,000 at one point, after being stuck under $30,000 for several months. But the Bitcoin halving is expected in the spring and it will likely reduce companies\' revenue. That means the cryptocurrency may need to rally another 60% by then to lessen the suffering of some high-cost miners. "Bitcoin prices holding steady at ($28,000-$32,000) is not tenable for a number of crypto companies, and especially not for high-cost miners," Needham\'s John Todaro said in a note this week. "We anticipate material stock upside for Coinbase and low-cost miners if bitcoin prices surpass $45,000-$50,000 by the anticipated halving date of April 15, 2024, and material weakness if prices cannot sustain $45,000+ post-halving, in particular for high-cost miners." "Post halving, lower-cost miners will take market share while higher cost producers will need to cut hash power contributed to the network until bitcoin prices rise," he added. Bitcoin\'s price is currently sitting just below $34,000, and chart analysts expect higher lows as well as higher highs over the next few months, with some anticipating it reaches $40,000 by the end of 2023. The Bitcoin halving event is highly anticipated event by crypto investors because it historically has set the stage for new bull runs. It takes place every four years when the reward for mining bitcoin – which makes up a significant portion of mining companies\' revenue – is cut in half. That reduction is mandated by the Bitcoin code to reduce the supply of the cryptocurrency over time. "The bitcoin mining industry is at a crucible moment as management teams (and investors) weigh the prospects of a bitcoin ETF, which may catalyze a rally, against record hashrate increases and the looming block reward halving that threaten industry revenues and profitability," JPMorgan analyst Reginald Smith said in an Oct. 11 note. "With that as a back drop, we think discipline and timing are paramount and favor operators that offer the best relative value in light of their existing hashrate, operational efficiency, power contracts, funded growth plans and liquidity." Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms are the largest mining stocks by market cap. Marathon famously has the highest energy costs and lowest margins, while Riot has relatively low power costs but shares are expensive. CLSK YTD mountain Cleanspark shares year to date CleanSpark is the only mining stock in JPMorgan\'s coverage universe with an overweight rating, though its price target implies a 12% decline from current levels. Needham highlighted Riot and Cipher as its favorites, noting that their diversified revenue exposure could make impact from the halving more muted. Lower revenue, higher costs Generally, the mining stocks benefit from bitcoin price increases because those translate into higher mining revenue for the company. Riot shares have risen more than 10% over the past week, while CleanSpark climbed 12%, Marathon added 17% and Cipher jumped 40%. But their performance is more complex than that. In addition to their revenue from block rewards about to be cut in half, miners are also facing a steady rise in the network hash rate – which measures how much computing power the Bitcoin network uses to process transactions and is a key indicator of the network\'s health. The Bitcoin hash rate has been hitting new all-time highs consistently throughout the year, which is good for the health and security of Bitcoin but tends to hurt miners\' revenue. "There\'s been more miners that have come to the market with hardware and more people are competing for these coins today than ever before, and that makes the economics for the entire industry challenging," Smith said. When it comes to costs, the main one for miners is electricity. Some have a contract with a power producer where they buy a certain amount of power annually at a fixed price. Miners who buy power at spot prices stand to lose from any spike in power prices, often in the summer or winter. Another big cost: hardware. Some miners use older, less efficient mining equipment and may not be able to invest in newer equipment as they juggle other costs and variables. That could be challenging for companies as the halving approaches, but a big enough rally could help. "If bitcoin goes up or doubles between now and the halving, these machines that I think will be uneconomical at the having could still be economical, and so it really depends on what happens with the price of bitcoin," Smith said. "Roughly 20% of the network is powered by machines that just won\'t be economical to the next halving so those machines will have to come offline. Depending on who runs them and whether or not that entity has faster machines somewhere else, they may get for...'}]

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
The news articles suggest that the approval of a Bitcoin ETF and the upcoming halving event are driving optimism in the cryptocurrency market, particularly for Bitcoin. The potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF is expected to attract more conservative investors and new investments into the sector, boosting demand. Additionally, the halving event is anticipated to reduce Bitcoin's supply growth, leading to an increase in its dominance. As a result, Bitcoin's price has surged, reaching an 18-month high, and leading to a rally in related stocks like NVIDIA, Block Inc., and Coinbase Global. However, concerns about high-cost miners and the impact of the halving event on mining stocks may pose challenges if Bitcoin fails to sustain its current price levels. Overall, the market trend appears bullish for Bitcoin and related stocks in the short term, but caution is advised for mining stocks as the halving event approaches.

As these options reach their expiration date, holders will have to decide whether to exercise their contracts or let them expire worthless.\n\nThis could lead to a spike in trading volume and volatility around the expiration time as market participants react to whether large options positions are exercised or not. CoinDesk reported the current open interest in contract terms has increased to $20.64, significantly higher than in November 2021 when BTC was around $66,000.\n\nThe impending options expiration comes after a period of positive price movement for top cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin rose from around $26,000 to over $34,000 in recent weeks. This market activity led to increased options trading.\n\nTraders and investors will be closely watching the impact of this historic options expiration as it unfolds today. The $4.5 billion in contracts set to expire represents the scale of the crypto options market today, and how it can drive price action and volatility in underlying assets.'}, {'id': 40, 'time': 'Fri, 27 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': '3 Buy-Rated Crypto Stocks to Consider as Bitcoin Prices Break Out - Nasdaq', 'content': 'Bitcoin (BTCUSD) prices have been on a wild ride lately, with the digital currency surging to its highest levels since May 2022 on growing hopes that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might finally give the green light to a spot Bitcoin ETF. Bitcoin has now doubled in value on a year-to-date basis, and is hovering right around $34,000 at last check.\n\nCoinbase (COIN), which is a big player in the crypto world, seems pretty confident that this ETF is on the horizon - but shares of the online exchange have shed more than 21% in the last three months while BTC has broken out, and analysts have a tepid consensus rating of “hold” on COIN. However, with asset management heavyweights like BlackRock (BLK) getting ready to cash in on regulatory clearance for BTC-based ETFs, it\'s worth taking a look at some investing opportunities among cryptocurrency and blockchain stocks.\n\nHere, we\'ll highlight three top-rated crypto stocks, all priced under $10 per share, that have been moving higher with BTC as the market braces for a potentially massive new wave of institutional investing dollars.\n\nBITF: Riding the Bitcoin Wave\n\nBitfarms Ltd. (BITF) is a Canadian Bitcoin mining company offering analytics and engineering services. In August 2023, Bitfarms reported mining a cool 383 new bitcoins - down from August 2022, but up sequentially from July\'s numbers. Plus, BTC mined through the first eight months of 2023 were higher YOY.\n\nLike most other miners, BITF is in the Bitcoin business - so when BTC prices are up, so is BITF\'s stock. The stock is up 162.5% YTD to trade around $1.15, and has a market cap of $243 million.\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nAll four analysts covering BITF are giving it the green light, with three shouting "strong buy," and one rating the stock a "moderate buy." The average target price for BITF is $3.19, hinting at potential 177% upside from current levels.\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nCIFR: Mining for Profits in the Bitcoin Boom\n\nCipher Mining Inc. (CIFR), a New York-based Bitcoin miner, is outperforming broader BTC prices this year. The company has a market cap of $883 million, and CIFR currently trades right around $3.33 per share.\n\nSince the start of 2023, CIFR\'s stock has rocketed by 492%, leaving BTC\'s 105% gain in the dust.\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nPlus, all seven analysts tracking CIFR rank it a strong buy overall. Five are shouting "strong buy," one\'s going with a "moderate buy," and one suggests a "hold."\n\nThe mean target price for CIFR is $5.00 is also interesting, given the stock\'s major rally already this year. That target indicates an expected upside of more than 50% from current levels, suggesting plenty more gains ahead.\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nRIOT: Capitalizing on the Crypto Craze\n\nColorado-based Riot Platforms Inc. (RIOT) might have renamed itself from Riot Blockchain, but the company\'s primary business is still focused on Bitcoin mining and infrastructure. So, when Bitcoin\'s up, RIOT\'s stock is on the rise too.\n\nRIOT\'s got a relatively hefty market cap of $1.945 billion, and trades just below $10 per share. On a year-to-date basis, RIOT has outpaced BTC prices by gaining 193% - and Wall Street sees more upside ahead.\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nOut of the 8 analysts following the shares, 6 call RIOT a “strong buy,” 1 suggests a “moderate buy,” and only 1 is daring to go against the grain with a “strong sell.” The mean target price for RIOT is $16.67, which represents a healthy premium of 68.5% to current levels.\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nThe Future of Crypto Stocks Amid Bitcoin\'s Breakout\n\nIn conclusion, as Bitcoin continues to flex its muscles and break out, these three buy-rated crypto stocks look intriguing. They\'ve been riding the Bitcoin wave, and with favorable analyst ratings, they\'re catching the attention of investors.\n\nBut here\'s the kicker: the crypto market can be an extremely volatile space. CIFR has a beta of 2.50, BITF has a beta of 3.28, and RIOT\'s beta is 4.31 - indicating all three stocks are considerably more volatile than the S&P 500 Index ($SPX), and are best suited for those investors with a healthy risk appetite. So while the potential upside is appealing, the heightened volatility and continuing regulatory overhang are worth keeping in mind here.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ebube Jones did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

It remains to be seen if this is a buy the rumor, sell the news type of event, but some things aren’t up for debate. First, a spot bitcoin ETF would clearly – it already is – benefit the digital currency’s price.\n\nSecond, such a product in the U.S. would likely bring a slew of new participants into the crypto market because some retail investors have been reluctant to embrace crypto due to technological concerns. Said another way, a spot bitcoin ETF could democratize the asset class and there’s precedent for happening – one set by god ETFs.\n\nWhile crypto enthusiasts and ordinary investors wait on word from the SEC, some of the following ETFs could be worth considering.\n\nBitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF (BITQ)\n\nThe Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF (BITQ) is an equity-based fund, but it’s chock full of stocks that fit the bill as “crypto-correlated.” BITQ, which follows the Bitwise Crypto Innovators 30 Index, is proving as much as highlighted by a gain of 9.28% over the past week.\n\nAs Bitwise itself notes, BITQ’s roster consists of “picks and shovels” players in the crypto space, including the likes of Microstrategy (MSTR) and crypto exchange operator Coinbase (COIN). Much of the rest of the ETF’s lineup consists of crypto miners – a group highly tethered to bitcoin’s price action. But there’s more to the story. A recent report by JPMorgan indicates some bitcoin miners are making strides in the artificial intelligence (AI) due to native supercomputing capabilities.\n\n“In these beta tests, miners are reporting high profitability per unit of power consumption, much above the profitability from bitcoin mining. With bitcoin miners having already secured more than 100MW of long-term contracts with their power grids, if the profitability reported in beta tests is able to be repeated in large scale it would overshadow in the future the revenues coming from bitcoin mining at the moment,” noted the bank.\n\nProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO)\n\nOne of the original futures-backed bitcoin ETFs, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) remains pertinent today because bitcoin futures are, of course, levered to the underlying asset’s price movements. To its credit, BITO, which turned two years old last week, has done a solid job of tracking spot bitcoin prices since inception.\n\nIt goes without saying that BITO would benefit (it already is) from approval of a spot bitcoin ETF, but there are more chapters in this book. Importantly, recent data indicate bitcoin’s correlation to stock is declining, but its correlation to gold is increasing. That fortifies the “digital gold” thesis.\n\n“We [view]bitcoin as an investment being a non-sovereign store of value which had potential exposure to economic and internet growth, whilst being largely uncorrelated to other asset classes,” according to CoinShares. “We also find that in the context of a portfolio, it behaves in a similar manner to other alternative assets in providing diversification, with the exception that its portfolio diversification benefits are far greater than its competitors.”\n\nVanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT)\n\nAs its name implies, the newly minted VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT) isn’t a bitcoin ETF. Rather, it’s focused on ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency behind bitcoin. EFUT is one of several new futures-based ethereum ETFs that recently came to market, indicating regulators are warming to non-bitcoin crypto fare in the ETF wrapper.\n\nThat could be one sign that if a spot bitcoin ETF is approve, there could be trickle-down effects to fund such as EFUT. Even if that scenario doesn’t come to fruition, ethereum offers investors an attractive fundamental story unto itself.\n\n“Ethereum’s limited space is managed through fees charged to users for conducting business and value exchange,” according to VanEck research. “This software is globally hosted and utilizes a protocol to establish a unified understanding of ownership, commercial activity, and business logic. It enables users to conduct commerce without the need for trust in participants or counterparts.

An earlier lawsuit from the CTFC in March that alleges the company "willfully evaded" securities laws and by targeting and onboarding US to its derivatives platform.\n\nBoth lawsuits target not just Binance, but also accuse its CEO, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), of breaking the law.\n\nThe pausing of US dollar withdrawals follows similar actions in Europe and Australia, where EUR and AUD payment partners have abandoned the firm, with no replacements to be found.\n\nJust months before AUD withdrawals were frozen, its Australian CEO Leigh Travers quit the firm as the Australian Securities and Investments Commission investigated Binance and closed its derivatives business by revoking its license.\n\nThings aren\'t much better across the pond either, with Binance losing its head of UK operations, \u200b\u200bJonathan Farnell, earlier this week.\n\nOn October 16, Binance restricted services for customers in the UK as a result of new Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) rules.\n\nThis is the latest in a series of departures, which saw Binance\'s Chief Strategy Officer, Senior Director of Investigations, and SVP for Compliance all depart in July.\n\nElsewhere, Binance is facing heat from regulators in Germany for violating securities laws and in both Japan and Singapore for operating without a license.\n\nFor their part, Binance continue to largely dismiss the claims against them, and have filed a request in court to have the SEC lawsuit thrown out.\n\nThe concern now is that Binance could face a liquidity crisis, similar to that of FTX and other defunct exchanges before it.\n\nIf users are forced to withdraw funds en masse, or simply panic, then it\'s unclear whether Binance would be able to meet demand.\n\nIt\'s no secret that Binance has built a sprawling web of financial services, which include all sorts of lending facilities, staking, funding deals, and trading activities.\n\nAny sudden capital flight could easily shock the system, and have flow-on effects throughout the industry.\n\nNo one quite knows if Binance is operating with integrity, but the concern is very real.\n\nThe Sam Bankman-Fried trial and FTX bankruptcy are still unresolved\n\nThe criminal trial against Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) is now in its 4th week, and won\'t conclude until November 9th at the earliest.\n\nA core line of inquiry has been FTX\'s sprawling empire and business dealings. These include hundreds of investments in crypto projects, its hedge fund Alameda and even millions of dollars of political donations.\n\nAs further evidence of illegal conduct is revealed, there\'s concern around what impact this will have on the wider industry – which is only just recovering.\n\nFor instance, FTX and its sister firm, Alameda, invested $5.3 billion in 473 companies via their venture capital efforts.\n\nOf this, approximately $3.2 billion was invested across 250 different crypto projects in return for tokens, or token IOUs.\n\nThe list includes major names like Polygon (MATIC), Near (NEAR) and Lido (LDO), as well as 200 or so lesser known projects.\n\nAs FTX administrators look to recoup customer assets, it’s possible that these tokens will be sold off in order to reimburse creditors.\n\nThe latest proposal from FTX\'s administrators looks to settle bankruptcy proceedings and return funds to creditors by July 2023.\n\nSo any major sell-offs should be expected before this date, and could potentially dampen any fuel added to Bitcoin\'s rocket by an ETF approval.\n\nThis wouldn\'t just dampen token prices either.\n\nMost projects rely on the value of their token to fund their on-going development. A sudden devaluation of their treasury would place the future of many projects in peril.\n\nA new lawsuit: Gemini, Genesis and Digital Currency Group sued by New York AG\n\n...'}, {'id': 39, 'time': 'Fri, 27 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'CryptoFinance: Cultures clash as bitcoin ETF turns rebellion into money - Financial Times', 'content': 'Print this page\n\nSimply sign up to the Cryptocurrencies myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nHello and welcome to the latest edition of the FT’s Cryptofinance newsletter.\n\n“The Times 03/Jan/2009: Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.”\n\nIn the early days of 2009, bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto etched that headline into the first batch of bitcoin transactions ever processed.\n\nThe message was a nod to bitcoin’s intended purpose, as laid down in the initial white paper: a form of electronic cash that offered people the chance to separate their financial lives from the control of powerful intermediaries such as banks, regulators or the government.\n\nCrypto’s confident, scornful and punky start came to mind this week for some when bitcoin surged to roughly $35,000. It was a small but meaningful moment: all those losses sustained after the Terra stablecoin collapsed and sent a whole heap of trouble pulsing through the market were erased.\n\nBut what triggered the gains was, well, nothing very much.\n\nThe market is on tenterhooks so much because BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, may soon receive regulatory approval in the US to launch a cash bitcoin exchange traded fund, something that invests directly in bitcoin and can be traded as easily on the New York Stock Exchange as Apple.\n\nBut this has been the case for months and the approvals may not come until next year. What seemed to have got bitcoin enthusiasts excited was BlackRock’s ETF added to a list of eligible assets that are held at the US securities clearing house.\n\nThis is the equivalent of a harried waiter in a crowded restaurant clearing a table, before ushering you over; a necessary step but it doesn’t mean you’re going to eat imminently.\n\nNor was the spike an isolated incident. Last week bitcoin leapt 8 per cent on a false rumour that BlackRock had indeed secured regulatory approval.\n\nThe assumption is that approval will inspire a new wave of inflows into a market that has long struggled with next to no liquidity.\n\nAs Jeremy Senderowicz of law firm Vedder Price told me: “To have an ETF launch necessarily represents the maturation of an asset class: it’s a sign that it has arrived in the format that anyone can access . . . you would think that could only be a good thing for crypto.”\n\nBut good news for Wall Street’s crypto-curious is not being welcomed everywhere. Crypto’s longtime believers, who have followed bitcoin’s development since the early days, tell me a financial revolution is being traded in for a spot on Wall Street.\n\n“It’s a maddening betrayal of crypto’s foundational principles, a sellout to traditional finance and a surrender of our ideals,” said Charles Storry, head of growth at crypto index platform Phuture.\n\n“Satoshi Nakamoto’s vision of a permissionless liberation from government now lies in the hands of the world’s largest establishment, asking America’s regulators to approve something that makes bitcoin just like any other asset class,” he added.\n\nSome still fight the good fight. Last month Erik Voorhees, founder of crypto platform ShapeShift and ardent crypto-libertarian, tried to rally the faithful:\n\n“Before crypto, all movement of funds required someone’s permission . . . try moving ten thousand dollars across a border and you’ll be swiftly reminded of the permissions that are imposed on you . . . so thank God a permissionless form of money was invented.”\n\nBut the excitement around BlackRock illustrates how the narrative on crypto has moved on as the reality of life intrudes. There is an argument that crypto should take what it can get: ETF approvals would be rare wins for a world whose former figurehead is on trial for fraud in New York, and whose biggest surviving companies are facing lawsuits for violating securities laws and illegally accessing US customers.\n\nIt’s also easy to imagine that a successful BlackRock application would send the price of bitcoin flying.\n\n“A BlackRock approval can open the tap for a lot of wealth managers and asset managers to take even a small position on bitcoin, it can potentially be a game-changer,” added Javier Rodriguez-Alarcon, chief commercial officer at XBTO, a digital assets platform.\n\nBut not even a potential bull run for bitcoin can shake off the sense of capitulation for the industry’s die-hards.\n\nOnly El Salvador and the Central African Republic adopted bitcoin as legal tender, nor did it really bank the unbanked, or seriously provide a financial lifeline to those living under an authoritarian regime.\n\nInstead Wall Street has executed its own takeover. Satoshi envisaged a unfluctuating world, where records are immutable and there are a finite number of bitcoins, 21mn. An ETF is a securitised version of bitcoin but it can be replicated, scaled and traded to match demand.\n\nAs Matthew Cloete, head of marketing at Ryze, a London crypto trading firm, notes:\n\n“Most people think that the ETF is going to be the catalyst for the next bull market, whi...'}]

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
The cryptocurrency market is currently experiencing increased volatility and speculation due to the expiration of over $4.5 billion worth of options contracts in Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF by the SEC. This has led to a surge in Bitcoin prices and positive price movement for other cryptocurrencies. Additionally, the market is closely watching the impact of these events on top-rated crypto stocks like Bitfarms Ltd., Cipher Mining Inc., and Riot Platforms Inc., which have been performing well in line with Bitcoin's price movements. However, concerns over regulatory issues, such as the ongoing legal battles faced by Binance and FTX, as well as the clash between traditional finance and crypto ideologies, may impact market sentiment. Overall, the market trend appears to be bullish in the short term, driven by positive price movements and potential institutional investment inflows, but caution is advised due to the regulatory uncertainties and potential market risks.

"""
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that there has been a consistent increase in various metrics related to ETH, indicating a positive trend in terms of usage and transactions. However, the MACD signal has remained on sell, suggesting a bearish trend in the market. This cautionary note is further supported by the news analyst report, which highlights the recent surge in Bitcoin's price driven by external factors such as ETF approvals and institutional interest. 

Reflecting on the past trading performance, it is evident that a slightly conservative approach focusing on long-term strategies and risk management has been effective. Key indicators such as on-chain data, MACD signals, and news developments have played a crucial role in making informed trading decisions. Given the mixed signals in the market, it is important to prioritize risk management and strategic decision-making to maximize profitability and navigate uncertainties effectively.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is advisable to adopt a slightly conservative approach and prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains. The market trend appears to be uncertain, with potential bearish signals from the MACD and external factors impacting the overall cryptocurrency market. Therefore, it is crucial to manage risk appropriately and stay informed about market trends to make informed trading decisions.

Based on this analysis, I would take a slightly conservative approach and assign a trading action of 0.3, reflecting moderate confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.

0.012053387086537803
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the ETH cryptocurrency market is currently experiencing a bearish trend, with the MACD indicator showing sell signals and potential price declines in the near future. The fluctuating total transactions, total value transferred, and average transaction fees indicate volatility in the market, further supporting the bearish outlook.

On the other hand, the news analyst report suggests a bullish trend in the overall cryptocurrency market, with positive sentiment towards Bitcoin and potential growth catalysts such as the approval of a U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF. The focus on alternative cryptocurrencies like Quant, Hedera, and Cardano also indicates a growing interest in the market.

In reflecting on the reports, it is clear that a slightly conservative approach focusing on long-term strategies and risk management is crucial in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. While the news points towards a bullish trend, the on-chain data for ETH indicates a bearish outlook, highlighting the importance of managing risk appropriately.

Considering the mixed signals in the market and the importance of prioritizing long-term strategies over short-term gains, I would recommend taking a slightly conservative approach to trading. Therefore, my trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.5, reflecting a cautious stance towards the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk effectively.

Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the ETH market is currently bearish, with indicators such as the MACD signals and total transactions pointing towards potential price declines in the near future. The news analyst report, on the other hand, highlights a bullish trend in the overall cryptocurrency market, particularly driven by positive developments in Bitcoin and related stocks. However, caution is advised for mining stocks as the halving event approaches.

Reflecting on the reports, it is clear that a slightly conservative approach focusing on long-term strategies and risk management has been effective in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. While short-term gains may be possible in the current bullish market, the mixed signals and potential price declines in ETH suggest that a more cautious approach is warranted.

Therefore, the clear market trend appears to be a mix of bearish sentiment in ETH and bullish optimism in Bitcoin and related stocks. In this scenario, prioritizing long-term strategies over short-term gains is crucial to manage risk effectively and maximize profitability.

Considering the market trend and the need for a conservative approach, I would take a slightly bearish stance on ETH and opt to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.5. This decision reflects my strategic choice to manage risk appropriately and prioritize long-term profitability over short-term gains.

Bitcoin skyrocketed right out of the gate, and by mid-July, had nearly doubled in price to $32,000. However, since then, Bitcoin\'s fortunes have cooled considerably. Bitcoin is trading around $28,000 as of this writing, a nearly 15% haircut from its intra-year high.\n\nSo is now the time to buy the dip on Bitcoin? After all, according to the Bitcoin bulls, the world\'s most popular cryptocurrency is simply taking a breather before once again marching higher. Are they right or wrong?\n\nChanging investor perceptions\n\nIf you are a long-term crypto investor, the good news is that the long-term outlook for Bitcoin remains largely unchanged. Bitcoin adoption rates worldwide continue to grow, Bitcoin still accounts for nearly 50% of the market cap of the entire crypto industry, and Bitcoin is still the crypto of choice for institutional and retail investors.\n\nThe bad news, though, is that investor perceptions about Bitcoin have changed. For institutional investors, the macroeconomic outlook for the U.S. economy has been front and center, and with so much uncertainty surrounding monetary policy and the future path of interest rates, it\'s perhaps only natural that Bitcoin has stalled out around the $30,000 level. The conventional wisdom on Wall Street is that risk assets (such as cryptocurrencies) do not perform well in high-interest-rate environments, so the Federal Reserve has emerged as a crucial factor in how investors view Bitcoin.\n\nAt one time, Bitcoin was largely uncorrelated with broader U.S. financial markets, and investors viewed Bitcoin as providing similar hedging benefits as gold. But that viewpoint has been steadily changing. Based on changing correlations between different asset classes, it now appears that Bitcoin is trading much more like a big tech stock. The important point here is that Bitcoin\'s correlation with other asset classes changes over time, and that influences how investors view Bitcoin.\n\nInstitutional money and Bitcoin\n\nIf there\'s one factor that can decisively move Bitcoin higher in the near and medium terms, it\'s the flow of new institutional money into Bitcoin. At one time, institutional investors wouldn\'t touch Bitcoin with a 10-foot pole. But, oh, how times have changed. The first big break came in August 2022, when BlackRock entered into a partnership with cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global to enable institutional access to crypto assets.\n\nSince then, the floodgates have opened. One development that has captured the attention of investors this year is the upcoming introduction of the first-ever spot Bitcoin ETF for the U.S. market. The process started this summer, when BlackRock announced plans for a spot Bitcoin ETF. After that, other high-profile institutional investors -- including Cathie Wood of Ark Invest -- jumped in with spot Bitcoin ETF applications of their own. Once one of these applications is approved, it could lead to a huge new inflow of institutional money into Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin halving\n\nIn April, Bitcoin will experience another "halving" event, in which the reward paid out to cryptocurrency miners for mining a new block of Bitcoin is cut by one-half. In three previous halving cycles (2012, 2016, and 2020), the price of Bitcoin has soared, and many Bitcoin analysts are expecting the same to happen in 2024. While past performance is no guarantee of future performance, it certainly hints at Bitcoin\'s long-term price potential.\n\nStandard Chartered Bank, for example, is predicting a price of $100,000 for Bitcoin by the end of 2024. And Pantera Capital, a crypto hedge fund, has set a price target of $149,000 for Bitcoin.\n\nThe theory is that the halving, by reducing the rate at which new Bitcoins are created in the future, will introduce a scarcity effect. As long as demand remains constant or increases, the price of Bitcoin should increase.\n\nDollar-cost averaging into Bitcoin\n\nBased on the above, I\'m bullish on Bitcoin\'s future prospects. From my perspective, the only thing that has changed is investor perceptions about Bitcoin. As a result, now could be the perfect time to start dollar-cost averaging into Bitcoin. By buying the same amount of Bitcoin at regular intervals (e.g., once per month), you would limit (but not eliminate) downside risk while also getting access to Bitcoin\'s enormous upside potential.\n\nIf you are expecting Bitcoin to regain its momentum heading into 2024, then dollar-cost averaging could be an effective strategy to accumulate Bitcoin.'}, {'id': 26, 'time': 'Sat, 28 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "SBF takes the stand, 'buy Bitcoin' searches soar and other news: Hodler's Digest, Oct. 22-28 - Cointelegraph", 'content': 'Top Stories This Week\n\nSam Bankman-Fried takes the stand on FTX’s collapse\n\nSam “SBF” Bankman-Fried testified this week in his ongoing criminal trial in the Southern District of New York, denying any wrongdoing between FTX and Alameda Research while acknowledging making “big mistakes” during the companies’ explosive growth. Highlights of his testimony include denying directing his inner circle to make significant political donations in 2021, as well as claims that FTX’s terms of use covered transactions between Alameda and the crypto exchange. Additionally, Bankman-Fried testified that he requested additional hedging strategies for Alameda in 2021 and 2022, but they were never implemented. The trial is expected to conclude within the next few days.\n\n‘Buy Bitcoin’ search queries on Google surge 826% in the UK\n\nGoogle searches for “buy Bitcoin” have surged worldwide amid a major crypto rally, with searches in the United Kingdom growing by more than 800% in the last week. According to research from Cryptogambling.tv, the search term “buy Bitcoin” spiked a staggering 826% in the U.K. over the course of seven days. In the United States, data from Google Trends shows that searches for “should I buy Bitcoin now?” increased by more than 250%, while more niche searches, including “can I buy Bitcoin on Fidelity?” increased by over 3,100% in the last week. Zooming out further, the search term “is it a good time to buy Bitcoin?” saw a 110% gain worldwide over the last week.\n\nThe United States Court of Appeals has issued a mandate following a decision requiring Grayscale Investments’ application for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) to be reviewed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In an Oct. 23 filing, the “formal mandate” of the court took effect, paving the way for the SEC to review its decision on Grayscale’s spot Bitcoin ETF. The mandate followed the court’s initial ruling on Aug. 29 and the SEC’s failure to present an appeal by Oct. 13. To date, the SEC has yet to approve a single spot crypto ETF for listing on U.S. exchanges but has given the green light to investment vehicles linked to Bitcoin and Ether futures.\n\nCoinbase disputes SEC’s crypto authority in final bid to toss regulator’s suit\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission overstepped its authority when it classified Coinbase-listed cryptocurrencies as securities, the exchange has argued in its final bid to dismiss a lawsuit by the securities regulator. In an Oct. 24 filing in a New York District Court, Coinbase chastised the SEC, claiming its definition for what qualifies as a security was too wide, and contested that the cryptocurrencies the exchange lists are not under the regulator’s purview. The SEC sued Coinbase on June 6, claiming the exchange violated U.S. securities laws by listing several tokens it considers securities and not registering with the regulator.\n\nGemini sues Genesis over GBTC shares used as Earn collateral, now worth $1.6B\n\nCryptocurrency exchange Gemini filed a lawsuit against bankrupt crypto lender Genesis on Oct. 27. At issue is the fate of 62,086,586 shares of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. They were used as collateral to secure loans made by 232,000 Gemini users to Genesis through the Gemini Earn Program. That collateral is currently worth close to $1.6 billion. According to the suit, Gemini has received $284.3 million from foreclosing on the collateral for the benefit of Earn users, but Genesis has disputed the action, preventing Gemini from distributing the proceeds. Genesis filed for bankruptcy in January. It had suspended withdrawals in November 2022, which impacted the Gemini Earn program.\n\nWinners and Losers\n\nAt the end of the week, Bitcoin (BTC) is at $34,143, Ether (ETH) at $1,789 and XRP at $0.54. The total market cap is at $1.26 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nAmong the biggest 100 cryptocurrencies, the top three altcoin gainers of the week are Pepe (PEPE) at 72.08%, Mina (MINA) at 55.47% and FLOKI (FLOKI) at 53.33%.\n\nThe top three altcoin losers of the week are Bitcoin SV (BSV) at -10.27%, Toncoin (TON) -3.14% and Trust Wallet Token (TWT) at -0.82%.\n\n\n\nFor more info on crypto prices, make sure to read Cointelegraph’s market analysis.\n\nMost Memorable Quotations\n\n\n\n“The witness [Sam Bankman-Fried] has an interesting way of responding to questions.”\n\nLewis Kaplan, senior judge of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York\n\n“When it comes to illicit finance, crypto is not the enemy – bad actors are.”\n\nCynthia Lummis, U.S. senator\n\n“I should say, I am not a lawyer, I am just trying to answer based on my recollection.

REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the ETH cryptocurrency market is currently experiencing a bearish trend, with the MACD indicator showing sell signals and potential price declines in the near future. The fluctuating total transactions, total value transferred, and average transaction fees indicate volatility in the market, further supporting the bearish outlook.

In reflecting on the reports, it is clear that a slightly conservative approach focusing on long-term strategies and risk management is crucial in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. While the news points towards a bullish trend, the on-chain data for ETH indicates a bearish outlook, highlighting the importance of managing risk appropriately.

Considering the mixed signals in the market and the importance of prioritizing long-term strategies over short-term gains, I would recommend taking a slightly conservative approach to trading.

As of this writing, the leading digital asset has soared 107% in 2023. And after the past couple of weeks, Bitcoin is now knocking on the door of $35,000.\n\nIt's easy to get caught up in a hugely positive price swing, with the intention of trying to ride the strong momentum. But before doing that, investors should really take the time to understand more about what makes Bitcoin a good investment opportunity.\n\nHere are three must-know reasons this top cryptocurrency is a screaming buy right now.\n\n1. Its absolute scarcity\n\nOne of Bitcoin's defining characteristics is that there will only ever be 21 million coins in circulation. There is a hard cap on the supply that is etched into the cryptocurrency's computer code. And unless the majority of the crypto's stakeholders -- including users, nodes, miners, and developers -- all agree to change this supply constraint, this is basically set in stone.\n\nA fixed supply is valuable because when demand rises, the price should as well; there is no way for supply to increase to match heightened demand. That's why Bitcoin's price has skyrocketed throughout its history.\n\nThis reality is in stark contrast to fiat currencies, like the U.S. dollar or the euro, which are constantly losing purchasing power because of ongoing money printing and inflation. In fact, the purchasing power of $1 has dropped more than 95% since the Federal Reserve was created in 1913.\n\nSome investors might view gold as having absolute scarcity, but this is inaccurate -- the supply does increase every year. And let's say that demand for the precious metal was to jump significantly in short order. In this scenario, it would be economically feasible for mining companies to try to extract gold from difficult-to-reach areas, so there is the possibility that supply could increase to meet demand.\n\n2. Its ownership by key figures\n\nSince its launch roughly 15 years ago, Bitcoin has been adopted by individuals mainly interested in computer science, cryptography, and privacy. But these days, because its market cap is $663 billion and there is a growing list of financial products and services supporting it, the digital currency is slowly finding itself more and more in the mainstream.\n\nSome prominent business figures have publicly announced their bullishness for the asset. Michael Saylor, billionaire founder of MicroStrategy, has purchased billions of dollars of Bitcoin, which his corporation holds on its balance sheet. Jack Dorsey, another billionaire founder himself, is focused on helping to advance Bitcoin adoption through his payments company Block, which also holds some of it on its balance sheet.\n\nFund managers like Bill Miller and Paul Tudor Jones both own Bitcoin in their personal holdings. And famed investor Cathie Wood, who heads up Ark Invest, is probably the most bullish on it. Her firm's base-case analysis suggests that the price could hit $683,000 by 2030, up 20-fold from today's level.\n\n3. Its near-term catalysts\n\nPerhaps the most pressing reason to buy Bitcoin is the list of near-term catalysts on the horizon. Maybe the market is realizing this, as its price has risen 31% just in the last month (as of Oct. 26).\n\nMany large asset managers have filed applications for Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The potential approval of these could introduce massive amounts of fresh capital to the crypto.\n\nThe upcoming halving, which is set for April 2024, is when Bitcoin's inflation rate gets cut in half. Historically, it has been a very bullish event for the price, both in the months leading up to it and in the months following.\n\nAnother possible catalyst is the chance that the Federal Reserve starts to cut interest rates in 2024. The central bank could be close to reaching its goal of taming inflation, after which it might want to take a more accommodating stance toward the economy. And this would be a positive backdrop for risky assets like Bitcoin."}]

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
The news articles suggest a positive outlook for Bitcoin, with factors such as the resurgence of crypto memes, the increasing popularity of Bitcoin futures on CME, and the three key reasons why Bitcoin is considered a strong investment opportunity. The articles highlight Bitcoin's scarcity, ownership by key figures, and upcoming catalysts as reasons for its potential growth. With the market showing signs of bullish sentiment and potential influx of capital from large asset managers, as well as upcoming events like the halving and potential interest rate cuts, it is likely that the market trend for Bitcoin will continue to be positive in the near future.

You are an experienced ETH cryptocurrency trader and you are trying to maximize your overall profit by trading ETH. In each day, you will make an action to buy or sell ETH. You are assisted by a few analysts below and need to decide the final action.

ON-CHAIN ANALYST REPORT:
"""
The ETH cryptocurrency has been experiencing a downward trend recently, with the open price decreasing from 33,077.30 to 34,531.74. The number of unique addresses has fluctuated but remained relatively high, indicating continued interest in the market. However, the total transactions and total value transferred have been decreasing, suggesting a decrease in overall activity. The average fee has also been fluctuating but remains relatively low. The MACD signal consistently indicates a sell trend. Overall, based on the recent data, it is likely that the ETH market will continue to trend downwards in the near future.
"""

NEWS ANALYST REPORT:
"""
The news articles suggest a positive outlook for Bitcoin, with factors such as the resurgence of crypto memes, the increasing popularity of Bitcoin futures on CME, and the three key reasons why Bitcoin is considered a strong investment opportunity. The articles highlight Bitcoin's scarcity, ownership by key figures, and upcoming catalysts as reasons for its potential growth. With the market showing signs of bullish sentiment and potential influx of capital from large asset managers, as well as upcoming events like the halving and potential interest rate cuts, it is likely that the market trend for Bitcoin will continue to be positive in the near future.

*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market has been on a downward trend with decreasing total transactions and total value transferred. The MACD signal consistently indicates a sell trend, suggesting a continued bearish outlook for ETH in the near future. 

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights a positive outlook for Bitcoin, with bullish sentiment and potential growth factors such as scarcity, ownership by key figures, and upcoming catalysts. This suggests a positive market trend for Bitcoin in the near future.

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a cautious approach focusing on long-term strategies and risk management is crucial in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. Given the mixed signals in the market, it is important to prioritize reliable sources of information and monitor market trends closely.

Considering the bearish trend in ETH and the bullish sentiment in Bitcoin, I would take a slightly conservative approach and prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains. Therefore, I would sell ETH and invest in Bitcoin with a confidence level of 0.7 to manage risk appropriately and optimize profitability in the long run.

It is widely speculated that the benchmark crypto might breach the $40,000 mark very soon.\n\nBeing the most well-known and “reliable” digital coin, BTC has solidified its position within the market itself.

"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently bearish, with a downward trend indicated by sell signals in the MACD indicator and a decrease in unique addresses and total transactions. The news analyst report, on the other hand, suggests a short-term bullish trend driven by increased volatility, positive price movements, and potential institutional investment inflows. However, regulatory uncertainties and market risks pose potential challenges.

Reflecting on the mixed signals from the reports, it is evident that a slightly conservative approach focusing on long-term strategies and risk management has been effective in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. By prioritizing reliable sources of information and closely monitoring market trends, informed trading decisions can be made to maximize profitability.

Considering the current market conditions and the importance of long-term strategies, I would recommend a cautious approach with a focus on risk management. Therefore, my trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.5, indicating a moderate level of certainty in the bearish market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that there is a bearish trend in the ETH market, with potential for further price declines due to fluctuating metrics and a consistent sell signal from the MACD indicator. The news analyst report provides a mixed sentiment in the overall cryptocurrency market, with a focus on Bitcoin's potential for growth driven by institutional adoption and positive developments. However, the uncertainty surrounding the ongoing trial involving Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX adds a layer of unpredictability to the market.

In reflection of the reports, it is clear that a slightly conservative approach focusing on long-term strategies and risk management is crucial in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. While short-term gains may be possible, it is important to prioritize long-term profitability and manage risk effectively.

Considering the synthesized reports, the overall market trend for ETH and other cryptocurrencies may see fluctuations in the short term but could potentially trend upwards in the long term. Therefore, it is advisable to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains to maximize profitability and manage risk effectively.

Based on the market trend and the need for a conservative approach, I would take a trading action with a confidence level of 0.3, indicating a cautious approach while still being open to potential opportunities in the market.

Price Gains Fuel Endorsements from Financial Planners - Bloomberg', 'content': 'Bitcoin’s climb to $35,000 is helping to restore its reputation in the world of investment advice.\n\nThe world’s largest cryptocurrency has more than doubled from last year’s epic collapse, a significant development when stocks have dropped and bond yields are surging. With the Federal Reserve planning to keep interest rates high, and geopolitical tensions threatening financial stability, some advisors say adding Bitcoin to an investment portfolio can be a good way to diversify.'}, {'id': 24, 'time': 'Tue, 31 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Bitcoin's ETF Momentum is Spurring the Biggest Monthly Gains Since January - Bloomberg", 'content': 'Fifteen years after the unofficial launch of Bitcoin, digital-asset enthusiasts are touting the cryptocurrency as finally being on the verge of mainstream acceptance.\n\nBitcoin has rallied about 27% in October, the biggest monthly increase since January, on surging expectations that the US Securities and Exchange Commission may soon approve exchange-traded funds that invest directly in the cryptocurrency after more than a decade of deliberation. Bitcoin was trading at around $34,450 on Tuesday, compared with $16,540 at the end of last year.'}, {'id': 22, 'time': 'Tue, 31 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Bitcoin: trial of SBF is no match for ETF enthusiasm - Financial Times', 'content': 'Print this page\n\nThe collapse of cryptocurrency exchange giant FTX marked the depths of the crypto downturn. Yet the ensuing trial of founder Sam Bankman-Fried, accused of defrauding customers, has not dragged crypto prices down further. Despite negative publicity, the price of bitcoin has doubled in the past year.\n\nThis has been attributed to two things. In early 2024, rewards for bitcoin miners are expected to drop by 50 per cent. The result is a tightening of supply that could lift prices. At the same time, the US could be on the cusp of regulatory action that confers new legitimacy on to digital assets.\n\nNext year, bitcoin buyers expect the US Securities and Exchange Commission to give BlackRock and other financial companies permission to launch exchange traded funds that invest directly in bitcoin. This, they believe, could spur more adoption by institutional investors and act as a challenge to nefarious, unregulated crypto platforms.\n\nBoth assumptions are wrong, even if the SEC grits its teeth and grants approval. ETFs may be more appealing than setting up wallets and buying tokens directly from unregulated exchanges, but their existence does not eliminate scams and volatility that investors find off-putting. When ProShares launched the first ETF that tracked contracts speculating on the future price of bitcoin in late 2021, bitcoin prices rose. The ETF finished its first day of trading at close to $42. It now trades at $17.50.\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap has fallen from a $3tn market cap to about $1.3tn. Elon Musk, an outspoken supporter of digital assets, has not opted to expose his electric car company Tesla to further price swings. Tesla invested $1.5bn in bitcoin in early 2021 to “maximise returns on our cash”. At the last count, its digital assets were just $184mn.\n\nLiquidity is in short supply. Remaining platforms are under pressure from regulators. Trading volumes at Coinbase, the largest US digital asset platform, fell 55 per cent in the first six months of the year. Without a supply of new money, the latest price rally is unsustainable.'}, {'id': 3, 'time': 'Tue, 31 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Bitcoin could hit $150,000 by 2025, predicts Bernstein - CNBC', 'content': 'The price of bitcoin could rise to $150,000 by 2025, Bernstein said Tuesday in a note citing optimism about a bitcoin exchange-traded fund.\n\nBernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani said the firm expects the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to approve a bitcoin ETF by the first quarter of 2024.\n\nThe bullish estimate is about five times the current price of around $34,000 and more than double bitcoin\'s all-time high of more than $67,000 set in November 2021.\n\nBernstein also expects that ETF approval would shift up to 10% of bitcoin\'s circulating supply toward ETFs. The approval would allow conventional investors to get bitcoin exposure directly from their investment portfolios. The only similar product is Grayscale\'s Bitcoin Trust , or GBTC, which presently holds around 3% of outstanding bitcoin, according to the note.\n\n"You may not like Bitcoin as much as we do, but a dispassionate view of Bitcoin as a commodity, suggests a turn of the cycle," Chhugani wrote. "A good idea is only as good as its timing - SEC approved ETFs by world\'s top asset managers (BlackRock, Fidelity et al), seems imminent."\n\nThe prediction came in a note where Chhugani initiated coverage on several bitcoin mining firms, saying that the bitcoin "halving" in April 2024 — in which bitcoin rewards will be halved as part of a planned and recurring event baked into the currency\'s underlying code — will force "losing miners" to be "washed out," paving the way for big gains by the survivors.\n\nLast week, the price of bitcoin reached $35,000, its highest level since May 2022. Investors have said they remain hopeful for a green light on the ETF by the end of the year after the SEC declined to appeal a key court ruling in Grayscale\'s lawsuit against it.\n\nHowever, the court ruling does not guarantee the SEC will approve a bitcoin ETF. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has long criticized the crypto industry as being rife with "fraudsters and scam artists," so whether the regulator will continue to fight against crypto ETFs is an open question.\n\nThe crypto industry has faced recent struggles, including the SEC\'s lawsuit against Binance for securities violations earlier this year. Last year, crypto exchange FTX filed for bankruptcy and its former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is currently on trial for fraud.\n\n\n\nDon\'t miss these CNBC PRO stories:'}, {'id': 31, 'time': 'Tue, 31 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "If You Invested $1000 In Bitcoin When Warren Buffett Called It 'Rat Poison Squared,' Here's How Much You'd Have Now - Nasdaq", 'content': 'Leading investor Warren Buffett is well-known for his sharp investment eye and buying companies and acquiring stock and watching values rise over the years.\n\nOne sector that Buffett has shied away from is cryptocurrency. Here\'s a look at Buffett\'s thoughts on cryptocurrency and how investors may have wanted to avoid the Oracle of Omaha\'s advice in this particular case.\n\nWhat Happened: Buffett has been a vocal critic of the leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) for many years. The bearish position of the Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE:BRK)(NYSE:BRK) CEO even made him named Bitcoin enemy number one by entrepreneur Peter Thiel previously.\n\nIn January 2018, Buffett warned investors about investing in cryptocurrency.\n\n"In terms of cryptocurrencies, generally, I can say with almost certainty that they will come to a bad ending," Buffett said at the time. "If I could buy a five-year put on every one of the cryptocurrencies, I\'d be glad to do it but I would never short a dime\'s worth."\n\nRelated Link: Exclusive – Scaramucci On What Warren Buffett Gets Wrong About Bitcoin\n\nA few month later, Buffett took his feelings on Bitcoin further during an interview with CNBC.\n\nReiterating Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger\'s thoughts that Bitcoin is "rat poison," Buffett told CNBC anchor Becky Quick that the cryptocurrency is "probably rat poison squared."\n\nBuffett has said that he wouldn\'t buy Bitcoin even if it dropped to $25.\n\nWhile the billionaire investor has not bought cryptocurrencies and has continued to speak out against them, he does own shares of a company that has bet on Bitcoin and other leading cryptocurrencies.\n\nAs Benzinga previously reported, Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway are shareholders in Nu Holdings (NYSE:NU), a Latin American digital bank. Nu Holdings is a crypto-friendly bank and has launched several cryptocurrency products along with allocating a portion of its cash to Bitcoin.\n\nMeet and engage with transformative Digital Asset and Crypto business leaders and investors at Benzinga’s exclusive event: Future of Digital Assets. Tickets are flying: Get yours!\n\nInvesting $1,000 in Bitcoin: While Buffett said he wouldn\'t invest in Bitcoin even if it hit $25, some investors have chosen to allocate a portion of their investments or holdings in the leading cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin traded between $9,695.12 and $9,964.50 on May 5, 2018 — the day of Buffett\'s "rat poison squared" comment.\n\nAn investor could have purchased 0.1004 BTC at the coin\'s high price of that day.\n\nThe $1,000 investment would be worth $3,462.82 today based on a price of $34,490.19 for Bitcoin at the time of writing. This represents a return of 246.3% since Buffett\'s comments.\n\nFor comparison, shares of Berkshire Hathaway are up 76.2% over the same time period, based on a starting price of $294,720 each.\n\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), which tracks the S&P 500 Index, is up 56.8% over the same time period, based on a starting price of $266.89.\n\nAs investors can see, Bitcoin has outperformed both the S&P 500 and Berkshire Hathaway since Buffett\'s now famous quote about the leading cryptocurrency.\n\nWhile Buffett has said he wouldn\'t touch cryptocurrency even if it hit $25 per coin, investors who bought when the legendary investor made his quote would be glad that they did.\n\nReady to win big?

The news articles suggest a positive outlook for Bitcoin, with price gains fueling endorsements from financial planners and expectations of mainstream acceptance through the approval of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Analysts predict Bitcoin could reach $150,000 by 2025, with optimism surrounding ETF approval shifting a significant portion of Bitcoin's circulating supply towards ETFs. However, concerns about regulatory challenges, liquidity issues, and the sustainability of the recent price rally are highlighted, indicating potential risks in the market.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that there is a bearish trend in the ETH market, with potential for further price declines due to fluctuating metrics and a consistent sell signal from the MACD indicator. The news analyst report provides a mixed sentiment in the overall cryptocurrency market, with a focus on Bitcoin's potential for growth driven by institutional adoption and positive developments. However, the uncertainty surrounding the ongoing trial involving Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX adds a layer of unpredictability to the market.

In reflection of the reports, it is clear that a slightly conservative approach focusing on long-term strategies and risk management is crucial in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. While short-term gains may be possible, it is important to prioritize long-term profitability and manage risk effectively.

Considering the synthesized reports, the overall market trend for ETH and other cryptocurrencies may see fluctuations in the short term but could potentially trend upwards in the long term. Therefore, it is advisable to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains to maximize profitability and manage risk effectively.

Based on the market trend and the need for a conservative approach, I would take a trading action with a confidence level of 0.3, indicating a cautious approach while still being open to potential opportunities in the market.
ACTION:
0.3
DAILY RETURN:
0.0035809784190001803
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market has been on a downward trend with decreasing total transactions and total value transferred. The MACD signal consistently indicates a sell trend, suggesting a continued bearish outlook for ETH in the near future. 

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights a positive outlook for Bitcoin, with bullish sentiment and potential growth factors such as scarcity, ownership by key figures, and upcoming catalysts. This suggests a positive market trend for Bitcoin in the near future.

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a cautious approach focusing on long-term strategies and risk management is crucial in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. Given the mixed signals in the market, it is important to prioritize reliable sources of information and monitor market trends closely.

Considering the bearish trend in ETH and the bullish sentiment in Bitcoin, I would take a slightly conservative approach and prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains. Therefore, I would sell ETH and invest in Bitcoin with a confidence level of 0.7 to manage risk appropriately and optimize profitability in the long run.
ACTION:
0.7
DAILY RETURN:
-0.002559964841999607
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH cryptocurrency is currently in a downward trend with potential for further downside movement. The sell signals in the MACD indicator indicate a bearish sentiment, and caution is advised for traders to closely monitor price action.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights a positive trend for Bitcoin, with growing institutional acceptance and potential for sustained growth. The rally in Bitcoin price and the interest from asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity suggest a shift towards Bitcoin as a viable investment option amidst market volatility.

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a cautious approach focusing on long-term strategies and risk management is crucial in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. While short-term gains may be tempting, prioritizing reliable sources of information and considering key trends such as regulatory uncertainties is essential for maximizing profitability in the long run.

Based on the synthesized reports, the clear market trend seems to favor a slightly conservative approach with a focus on long-term strategies. Therefore, my trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.5, indicating a moderate level of confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.

This is not unusual, with cryptocurrencies having a reputation for skyrocketing in quick time. Bitcoin is likely to trade above $50,000 in the next few months. Besides exposure to quality cryptocurrencies, consider buying some of the best crypto stocks for robust returns.\n\nThe news of the possibility of a spot ETF for Bitcoin will likely be a key upside catalyst. Additionally, Bitcoin’s halving is due in 2024 and will have a positive impact on the digital asset.\n\nFurther, the rise in geopolitical tensions has supported the flow of funds into Bitcoin. If these factors were insufficient, I would add that potential rate ruts are due next year. A weak dollar is positive for all risky asset classes.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet’s discuss three crypto stocks to buy at current levels.\n\nCoinbase Global (COIN)\n\nA Bitcoin rests on top of a computer with the Coinbase (COIN) logo and a trading chart.\n\nSource: Nadezda Murmakova / Shutterstock.com\n\nCoinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) stock has already surged by 129% year-to-date. However, the rally from oversold levels does not make COIN stock expensive. I would bet on another 100% returns if Bitcoin touched $50,000.\n\nIt’s worth noting that Coinbase is among the top five centralized exchanges globally. The company stands to benefit if there is a cryptocurrency bull market. Trading and speculation will likely increase, translating into higher income for Coinbase.\n\nIn March 2023, Coinbase initiated an international expansion drive in six continents. This is important to mention as the company has been making steady business progress during the cryptocurrency bear market. Global expansion and the continued addition of new digital assets to the platform are other factors that will boost trading volumes.\n\nCoinbase ended Q2 2023 with cash and equivalents of $5.5 billion. With adjusted EBITDA turning positive, the company has high financial flexibility to make aggressive investments for growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nRiot Platforms (RIOT)\n\nIn this photo illustration, the Riot Platforms (RIOT) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nRiot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) is possibly the best Bitcoin mining stock to consider at current levels. After touching highs of $20.7 in July, RIOT stock has corrected to $9.8. This presents a good accumulation opportunity. If Bitcoin touches $50,000 in the next few quarters, RIOT stock will likely triple.\n\nFrom a fundamental perspective, Riot is attractive, with $510 million in cash and digital assets. Further, the company has a zero-debt balance sheet that provides high financial flexibility.\n\nRiot also has ambitious expansion plans. As of Q3 2023, the company reported a hash rate capacity of 10.7EH/s. The company expects to expand capacity to 20.1EH/s by Q4 2024 and further to 35.4EH/s in 2025.\n\nThis will likely translate into robust revenue and cash flow upside if Bitcoin remains in an uptrend. As the company’s financial flexibility increases further, there is a strong case for diversification-driven growth.\n\nBitfarms (BITF)\n\nBitcoin and crypto mining farm. Big data center. High tech server computers at work. Bitfarms (BITF) mines crypto.\n\nSource: PHOTOCREO Michal Bednarek / Shutterstock.com\n\nI am also tempted to talk about a penny crypto stock to buy as Bitcoin trends higher. Bitfarms (NASDAQ:BITF) is another attractive Bitcoin miner that seems poised to deliver multibagger returns. On a very conservative basis, BITF stock will double from current levels. However, I would not be surprised with 3x to 5x returns if Bitcoin is at $50,000.\n\nAs of September, Bitfarms reported a mining capacity of 6.1EH/s with a year-on-year growth of 45%. The important point to note is that Bitfarms reported a liquidity buffer of $65 million for Q2 2023. Additionally, the company expects to be debt free by February 2024. Therefore, there is high financial flexibility to pursue aggressive expansion.\n\nAnother positive is that the company is a low-cost Bitcoin miner. For Q2 2023, Bitfarms reported direct cost of production at $15,700 per Bitcoin. Assuming a scenario where Bitcoin trades above $50,000, the company will be positioned to report healthy EBITDA and cash flows. A big rally from current levels, therefore, seems entirely likely.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The news articles suggest a mixed sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin bouncing back to a 17-month high amidst positive factors such as the Federal Reserve's stance on interest rates and growing demand for exchange-traded funds.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market has been on a downward trend with decreasing total transactions and total value transferred. The MACD signal consistently indicates a sell trend, suggesting a continued bearish outlook for ETH in the near future. 

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights a positive outlook for Bitcoin, with bullish sentiment and potential growth factors such as scarcity, ownership by key figures, and upcoming catalysts. This suggests a positive market trend for Bitcoin in the near future.

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a cautious approach focusing on long-term strategies and risk management is crucial in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. Given the mixed signals in the market, it is important to prioritize reliable sources of information and monitor market trends closely.

Considering the bearish trend in ETH and the bullish sentiment in Bitcoin, I would take a slightly conservative approach and prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains. Therefore, I would sell ETH and invest in Bitcoin with a confidence level of 0.7 to manage risk appropriately and optimize profitability in the long run.
ACTION:
0.7
DAILY RETURN:
-0.002559964841999607
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH cryptocurrency is currently in a downward trend with potential for further downside movement. The sell signals in the MACD indicator indicate a bearish sentiment, and caution is advised for traders to closely monitor price action.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights a positive trend for Bitcoin, with growing institutional acceptance and potential for sustained growth. The rally in Bitcoin price and the interest from asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity suggest a shift towards Bitcoin as a viable investment option amidst market volatility.

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a cautious approach focusing on long-term strategies and risk management is crucial in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. While short-term gains may be tempting, prioritizing reliable sources of information and considering key trends such as regulatory uncertainties is essential for maximizing profitability in the long run.

Based on the synthesized reports, the clear market trend seems to favor a slightly conservative approach with a focus on long-term strategies. Therefore, my trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.5, indicating a moderate level of confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.
ACTION:
-0.5
DAILY RETURN:

REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently bearish, with a downward trend in open price, unique addresses, total transactions, and MACD signal indicating a sell trend. The news analyst report, on the other hand, suggests a bullish short-term outlook for Bitcoin due to positive sentiment surrounding ETF approval, despite regulatory challenges and market volatility. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the effectiveness of a cautious and slightly conservative trading approach, focusing on long-term strategies and risk management.

Synthesizing the reports, it is evident that while there may be short-term bullish opportunities in Bitcoin, the overall market trend for ETH remains bearish. Therefore, it is crucial to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains to navigate the volatile cryptocurrency market successfully. Monitoring market trends closely, particularly regulatory uncertainties and institutional adoption, will be key to optimizing profitability.

Considering the bearish trend in ETH and the cautious approach recommended in the reflection analyst report, I would take a slightly conservative trading action with a confidence level of 0.3. This decision reflects my acknowledgment of the market trend, my strategic focus on risk management, and my commitment to long-term growth potential in the cryptocurrency market.

*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently bearish, with a downward trend in prices and indicators such as the MACD signal pointing towards a sell trend. The fluctuating number of unique addresses and total value transferred also suggest uncertainty in market sentiment. 

On the other hand, the news analyst report presents a cautiously optimistic outlook for the cryptocurrency market, with potential for growth driven by factors such as the Federal Reserve's stance on interest rates and the possibility of a Bitcoin spot ETF. However, there are also concerns raised by the writedown on Bitcoin holdings by MicroStrategy, indicating some level of risk in the market.

In reflection, it is evident that a long-term trading strategy focused on risk management is crucial in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. By considering both the bearish on-chain indicators and the cautiously optimistic news sentiment, it is important to prioritize risk management and avoid short-term gains.

Therefore, considering the mixed signals from the reports and the importance of a long-term strategy, I would take a slightly conservative approach and decide to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.3. This decision reflects my cautious stance towards the current market trend and my strategic focus on managing risk effectively for long-term profitability.

Because that's been a declining trend. It has. We saw record low volatility is the lowest we've seen since we measured it in 2016. And when we see low volatility, we tend to see less active trading of our advanced trade clients, of our markets, which are our most advanced traders. I would note that these tend to be our lower revenue customers, but it's a broader trend that we're seeing. What I'm pleased to show, though, is even in these very low volatility environments with low trading volume, we generated $181 million of adjusted EBIT. We generated only a $2 million loss of net income. And so we're very proud of our financial performance. Despite the low volatility and the low trading volume that we saw this quarter for the current quarter than the quarter, that Coinbase can claim profitability with just how much you have been able to kind of keep a handle on the bottom line. I think it's really important to share the beginning of this year we said that we were wanting to build a company that could generate positive adjusted EBITDA in all market environments and we're very proud that now for those three quarters in a row, we generated more than $100 million of positive adjusted EBITDA. This is a change from when we went public when we were trying to generate profits through a cycle. And we really listen to the market and we brought down our expenses. We're proud of being a more financially disciplined company. We're offering with a lot more efficiency now and being able to deliver the financial results that we did this quarter. To the extent that the environment stays somewhat muted, do you think that Coinbase is going to have to tighten its belt further? And should you have to, where does that come from? It's a good question. Again, our goal right now is to generate positivity in all market conditions and we are pleased that we were able to do so this quarter. We also think it's important to continue investing in new technologies in the future of crypto. We have a three phase and product strategy that we are excited about, which is continuing to invest in utility, international expansion, growing new innovative products and services. We just watched derivatives this quarter, which we think is going to be an area that will continue to see investments in growth in coming quarters. And so given the financial performance, no, we're not looking to make a significant change to our expenses in Q4. And we say that in our shareholder letter about what our outlook is in the near term. However, we are always looking at the market and looking for what are the catalyst for growth, what are the risks and adjusting accordingly. Well, let's talk about one of the big potential calls in the market right now, and that is, of course, potential US spot Bitcoin ETF approval. Obviously that has ignited a rally in everything crypto. And I want to talk to you about what that could mean about Coinbase's business because a few of the more bearish analysts out there have argued that that might actually be a negative for Coinbase because it could further pull trading away from your platform. So I think what is loud and clear is that investors would like access to crypto and you see that with the excitement around these Bitcoin ETFs. So we believe this is going to be additive, this is going to be new capital that enters the market because today certain types of investors, whether that's pensions or registered investment advisors, they don't have the ability to access Bitcoin for their customers. So we believe this is going to bring new capital to the market. We will also benefit with our platform of just added interest in Bitcoin more broadly will benefit because we are going to be selected as a infrastructure provider to some of the issuers in this space where we can then custody and provide that service to the market. But overall, we think this grows, the pie grows, the interest in Bitcoin overall, and that's going to be a net benefit to the ecosystem in US. Well, just to push back, it's interesting to read this note coming from Barclays, basically asking the question is the offset that people don't need to trade Bitcoin on Coinbase because they can just buy the ETF in a typical brokerage account? I mean, is that a potential, a possibility that you're preparing for? We prepare for all sorts of possibilities, but that's not what we expect to happen. We think that there's a lot of people who are crypto enthusiasts who are looking for the underlying access to the spot asset to be able to use that in different ways.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH cryptocurrency is currently in a downward trend with potential for further downside movement. The sell signals in the MACD indicator indicate a bearish sentiment, and caution is advised for traders to closely monitor price action.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights a positive trend for Bitcoin, with growing institutional acceptance and potential for sustained growth. The rally in Bitcoin price and the interest from asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity suggest a shift towards Bitcoin as a viable investment option amidst market volatility.

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a cautious approach focusing on long-term strategies and risk management is crucial in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. While short-term gains may be tempting, prioritizing reliable sources of information and considering key trends such as regulatory uncertainties is essential for maximizing profitability in the long run.

Based on the synthesized reports, the clear market trend seems to favor a slightly conservative approach with a focus on long-term strategies. Therefore, my trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.5, indicating a moderate level of confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.
ACTION:

DAILY RETURN:
0.00018134184650953067
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently bearish, with a downward trend in open price, unique addresses, total transactions, and MACD signal indicating a sell trend. The news analyst report, on the other hand, suggests a bullish short-term outlook for Bitcoin due to positive sentiment surrounding ETF approval, despite regulatory challenges and market volatility. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the effectiveness of a cautious and slightly conservative trading approach, focusing on long-term strategies and risk management.

Synthesizing the reports, it is evident that while there may be short-term bullish opportunities in Bitcoin, the overall market trend for ETH remains bearish. Therefore, it is crucial to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains to navigate the volatile cryptocurrency market successfully. Monitoring market trends closely, particularly regulatory uncertainties and institutional adoption, will be key to optimizing profitability.

Considering the bearish trend in ETH and the cautious approach recommended in the reflection analyst report, I would take a slightly conservative trading action with a confidence level of 0.3. This decision reflects my acknowledgment of the market trend, my strategic focus on risk management, and my commitment to long-term growth potential in the cryptocurrency market.
ACTION:
0.3
DAILY RETURN:

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently bearish, with a downward trend in prices and indicators such as the MACD signal pointing towards a sell trend. The fluctuating number of unique addresses and total value transferred also suggest uncertainty in market sentiment. 

On the other hand, the news analyst report presents a cautiously optimistic outlook for the cryptocurrency market, with potential for growth driven by factors such as the Federal Reserve's stance on interest rates and the possibility of a Bitcoin spot ETF. However, there are also concerns raised by the writedown on Bitcoin holdings by MicroStrategy, indicating some level of risk in the market.

In reflection, it is evident that a long-term trading strategy focused on risk management is crucial in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. By considering both the bearish on-chain indicators and the cautiously optimistic news sentiment, it is important to prioritize risk management and avoid short-term gains.

Therefore, considering the mixed signals from the reports and the importance of a long-term strategy, I would take a slightly conservative approach and decide to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.3. This decision reflects my cautious stance towards the current market trend and my strategic focus on managing risk effectively for long-term profitability.

Coinbase saw trading volumes sink in its third quarter amid volatile trading sessions for the cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, MicroStrategy had to write down more than $33 million in its most recent quarter, thanks to the falling coin price since its November 2021 peak.\n\nOur next guest has remained a Bitcoin bull despite the fluctuating price and scandals in the crypto sector, like Sam Bankman-Fried\'s recent fraud conviction. Let\'s bring in Bill Miller IV, Miller Value Partners Portfolio Manager.\n\nBill, good to talk to you today. Let me get your reaction, first of all, to the verdict that was handed down. What this, ultimately, means for crypto as a whole?\n\nBILL MILLER: Well, I think it\'s really important that we differentiate between Bitcoin and crypto. So crypto was convicted yesterday on seven counts of fraud. Lying to people about what you\'re doing with their money is wrong.\n\nThe beauty of Bitcoin is that\'s not an issue. There is a very clear digital ledger maintained by computers and a very clear protocol out there that\'s visible for everyone to see. Bitcoin is very different from crypto.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo crypto was convicted yesterday. Bitcoin is still going very, very strong. The networks are strong as it\'s ever been. There\'s more users than there\'s ever been. So we continue to see very positive trends in Bitcoin, not so much in crypto.\n\nBRAD SMITH: What is the most positive trend? And do you believe that it\'s largely-- especially with some of the price action that we\'ve seen recently that seems to have been driven, not so much by what\'s taking place in trials, but more so by some of the ETFs that could be set for approval?\n\nBILL MILLER: Yeah. I think the big picture trend is that Bitcoin is the best performing asset in nine of the past 12 years. It\'s been up three out of four years. People tend to focus on the very short-term fluctuations and the volatility. But the reality is, there\'s a real demand globally for an uncensorable asset, where the regulators can\'t change the rules and the measuring stick over time.\n\nSo I think another thing that\'s driven Bitcoin\'s appreciation recently is the massive debts we\'re racking up in the US. Deficits are going up. Debts are going up. And someone\'s going to have to pay for that. Ultimately, it\'s going to come from money printing.'}, {'id': 20, 'time': 'Fri, 03 Nov 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Bitcoin's Golden Cross, Ethereum's And Dogecoin's Bellwether Indicator: A Look At Cryptos Into The Weekend - Nasdaq", 'content': "Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) and Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) were trading relatively flat during Friday’s trading session on lower-than-average volume despite the general market surging following the Federal Reserve’s decision Wednesday to hold interest rates steady.\n\nThe three popular cryptos have been consolidating since Oct. 24, after Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin surged on hopes the Security and Exchange Commission is close to approving a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nFrom a technical analysis standpoint, the cryptos have been consolidating near highly important technical levels, with Bitcoin trading under strong resistance at the $36,000 mark and Ethereum and Dogecoin moving horizontally above the 200-day simple moving average (SMA).\n\nThe 200-day SMA is an important bellwether. Technical traders and investors consider a stock trading above the level on the daily chart to be in a bull cycle, whereas a stock trading under the 200-day SMA is considered to be in a bear cycle.\n\nThe 50-day SMA also plays an important role in technical analysis, especially when paired with the 200-day. When the 50-day SMA crosses below the 200-day SMA, a death cross occurs whereas when the 50-day SMA crosses above the 200-day, a bullish golden cross takes place.\n\nWant direct analysis?

The consolidation has been taking place on declining volume, which is often followed by a burst in high volume.\n\nThe sideways consolidation is helping to lower Bitcoin’s relative strength index (RSI), which has been trading above the 70% level since Oct. 19. When a stock’s or crypto’s RSI is above 70%, it’s considered to be overbought, which can be a sell signal for technical traders.\n\nBullish traders want to see Bitcoin’s RSI continue to lower and then for big bearish volume to come in and break the crypto up through $36,000, which could accelerate a move to the upside toward $40,000. Bearish traders want to see big bearish volume come in and break Bitcoin down below the eight-day exponential moving average, which would negate the crypto’s current uptrend.\n\nIt should be noted that a golden cross, which occurs when the 50-day SMA crosses above the 200-day, formed on Bitcoin’s chart on Oct. 29, which suggests the crypto is in a strong bull cycle.\n\nBitcoin has resistance above at $35,593 and at $38,105 and support below at $31,862 and at $31,418.\n\nThe Ethereum and Dogecoin Charts: Ethereum and Dogecoin have been consolidating sideways near the 200-day SMA, with Ethereum trading sideways above that area and Dogecoin under it. Both Ethereum and Dogecoin have been consolidating near the 200-day on decreasing volume, which like Bitcoin, indicates a larger move in one direction is on the horizon.\n\nWhile Ethereum is trading in an uptrend within its consolidating pattern, Dogecoin is trading in a tightening range, forming a triangle formation. If the cryptos break bullishly from their respective patterns, a more powerful move to the upside could be in the cards.\n\nBearish traders want to see Ethereum break down under the 200-day SMA and for Dogecoin to break down from the lower ascending trendline of the triangle. If either of those two things happens, downside pressure is likely to accelerate.\n\nEthereum has resistance above at $1,825 and at $1,937 and support below at $1,717 and at $1,615.\n\nDogecoin has resistance above at $0.069 and at $0.075 and support below at $0.065 and at $0.061.\n\nRead Next: Jack Dorsey's Block And Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy Are Both Big On Bitcoin — But Here's The Real Winner - MicroStrategy\n\n© 2023 Benzinga.com.

Bitcoin, the pioneering digital asset, has led the way in revolutionizing financial market concepts. As the value of Bitcoin continues to rise, investors are keeping a close eye on its potential for future growth. However, with the emergence of Bitcoin forks and alternative cryptocurrencies, there are now additional opportunities for investors to explore. In this article, we will delve deep into the world of Bitcoin forks and alternatives, analyzing their features, benefits, and potential for success in 2023.\n\nUnderstanding Bitcoin Forks\n\nBitcoin forks are created when developers make changes to the original Bitcoin code, resulting in the creation of a new cryptocurrency. These forks can be categorized into two types: hard forks and soft forks. Hard forks involve significant changes to the protocol, resulting in the creation of a new blockchain. Soft forks, on the other hand, involve minor changes that are backward compatible with the original blockchain.\n\nPopular Bitcoin Forks Bitcoin XT\n\nOne of the earliest Bitcoin forks was Bitcoin XT, created in 2014. Bitcoin XT aimed to increase the number of transactions per second by increasing the block size. However, the project faced challenges and eventually lost momentum.\n\nBitcoin Classic\n\nFollowing the failure of Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic emerged in 2016. The developers of Bitcoin Classic focused on increasing the block size to improve scalability. While the project initially gained support, it has since seen a decline in popularity.\n\nBitcoin Unlimited\n\nBitcoin Unlimited, launched in 2016, offered an alternative approach to scaling Bitcoin. The project allowed miners to determine the block size, providing more flexibility in the network. However, Bitcoin Unlimited has not gained significant traction and remains a lesser-known fork.\n\nBitcoin Cash\n\nBitcoin Cash, created in 2017, is one of the most well-known Bitcoin forks. It aimed to address the scalability issues of Bitcoin by increasing the block size to 8MB. Bitcoin Cash has gained a substantial following and has become a popular alternative to Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin Gold\n\nBitcoin Gold, launched in 2017, focused on making mining more accessible to individual miners. The project aimed to bring back the use of GPUs instead of specialized mining hardware. While Bitcoin Gold has not achieved the same level of success as Bitcoin Cash, it remains an interesting alternative in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe Rise of Bitcoin Alternatives\n\nWhile Bitcoin forks have gained attention, there are also numerous alternative cryptocurrencies that offer unique features and benefits. These alternatives seek to address various issues faced by Bitcoin, such as scalability, transaction speed, and decentralization.\n\nEthereum\n\nEthereum is another leading digital currency that has made significant advancements in the blockchain space. Ethereum offers a platform for decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, expanding on the initial Bitcoin concept and giving additional use to its cryptocurrency. The smart contract feature allows the blockchain to be a bed for developers to flourish with their own token-based products.\n\nBitcoin Spark\n\nBitcoin Spark builds on both Bitcoin and Ethereum as an alternative that utilizes a unique Proof-of-Process (PoP) mechanism. This mechanism combines Proof-of-Work (PoW), originally introduced by Bitcoin, and Proof-of-Stake (PoS), to which Ethereum has recently changed to improve mining decentralization and transaction speed. Bitcoin Spark allows anyone with a smartphone to participate in the mining process, democratizing the cryptocurrency space.\n\nThe Potential of Bitcoin Forks and Alternatives\n\nAs Bitcoin continues to rise in value, many investors are looking for alternative investment opportunities in the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin forks and alternatives offer unique features and benefits that may appeal to different investors. The Bitcoin Spark ICO is the next step on this journey to profitable Bitcoin alternatives, with many investors already grabbing large allocations.\n\nPredicting the future of Bitcoin forks and alternatives is challenging due to the volatility and unpredictability of the cryptocurrency market. However, with the increasing interest from institutional investors and the potential for market-wide adoption, there is a possibility of significant growth and development in this space. Investors should conduct thorough research and analysis before making any investment decisions.\n\nThere is no doubt that making the next leap in technology will bring about huge interest, and what Bitcoin Spark brings to the table with its Proof-Of-Process technology that allows revenue to be generated on top of the blockchain will certainly pull many in the industry towards it.\n\nIf Bitcoin Spark works in the same way many of the previous Bitcoin alternatives have, it may be interesting to see how it unfo...'}, {'id': 17, 'time': 'Fri, 03 Nov 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "MicroStrategy's Saylor on Bankman-Fried, Bitcoin ETF - Bloomberg", 'content': "00:00\n\nA verdict in the Sam Bankman-fried case. Being found guilty on seven counts of fraud. We'd love to hear your reaction to that ruling and what it potentially means for the crypto industry going forward. I think that it's an important milestone in the growth and the maturation of the industry. The crypto industry has been plagued by inexperienced entrepreneurs like Sam, unreliable custodians like RTX incompetent creditors. A dozen went bankrupt in the last year or two. Unscrupulous promoters and their failure is a necessary rite of passage for an industry that's going to lead to a new, more stable, more scalable ecosystem that will be based on Bitcoin. Public companies like BLOCK MicroStrategy Marathon, a dozen Bitcoin miners that are public institutional money managers like Fidelity and BlackRock and regulated banks when they eventually become custodians. The offshore crypto exchanges, the stablecoins, the crypto tokens, the defi projects they're going to shrink, fade into the background and decouple from mainstream and institutional digital assets marketplace that will be based on Bitcoin. And Michael, you bring up BlackRock, you bring up Fidelity, and of course both of those firms have applications in for a spot U.S. Bitcoin ETF, something that hasn't been approved yet. But there's a lot of speculation, a lot of optimism that it could be soon. What would that mean for MicroStrategy, given that? I mean, you've been on the record to saying that MicroStrategy shares are a proxy for Bitcoin. If you're able to get that through a physically backed ETF, would that lessen the premium that MicroStrategy enjoys? I think it's critical for there to be a spot ETF for mainstream retail investors and mainstream institutional investors to participate. So it's going to lay a base layer that's going to allow large amounts of capital to flow into the industry. MicroStrategy is a special investment vehicle for Bitcoin. Long balls were different from an ETF because we don't charge a fee. We can use intelligent leverage. We borrowed 2.2 billion at 1.6% interest to buy Bitcoin, and we can generate a tax deferred bitcoin premium either by using cash purchased by cash purchases or by capital markets activity. So we're not for everybody. And in sovereign wealth funds that want to buy $50 billion worth of Bitcoin can't fit into the MicroStrategy capital structure. But if you want leverage and this tax deferred yield and no fee, then we're an interesting alternative for people in the space with regards to building up that position, that that crypto position even further than what you have. Does the introduction of those ETFs, would that create competition to increase ASICs asset class asset sizes? Excuse me? I think it's going to help everybody in the space. They're going to accelerate education efforts and adoption. And already you can see fidelity analysts are making a huge impact on the digital asset space. So as you see Wall Street analysts from all these ETF firms and you see their education and marketing efforts come into the space and as they provide the rails for traditional institutional investors and endowments and the like to engage, they're going to expand their entire ecosystem, but they're not an operating company. They can't take on leverage. They can't not charge a fee. I mean, we literally don't charge a fee and they can't they can't engage in cash purchases with operating income like we can in order to generate that tax deferred Bitcoin premium. It's interesting to to see some of the moves in Bitcoin this year. Obviously, the volatility is still there, but not necessarily to the extremes that we saw in prior years. And I'm wondering if the introduction or the broadening out of the user base will reintroduce that volatility or have we kind of moved past that? Are we kind of in a different era now? Well, I think we've reached a nice point. But, you know, when Bitcoin plus past $100000 to $200000, maybe it'll trade from 250,000 down to 175,000. And people are going to be screaming the end again. So Bitcoin is is compounding at 40 to 50% annualized growth rate for the past three and a quarter years since MicroStrategy got into the space with a lot of volatility. I think an analyst, Timmer from Fidelity pointed out it is got the highest volatility of any asset, but it's also got the greatest return. And so as I've said in the past, volatility has vitality. I'd rather have the volatility and the performance than get rid of the volatility. Gold's not volatile, but it's also down 1% in three and a quarter years. So that's not what we're looking for. Michael, I want to talk a little bit more about the user base of crypto who's actually buying, because, of course, if you take a look at the trading market, you've seen trading volume absolutely fall off a clip. And the narrative I keep hearing is that you've had all these retail players flushed out after what we saw with FTC's a year ago. So maybe a spot Bitcoin ETF is i..."}]

"""
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently bearish, with a downward trend in open price, unique addresses, total transactions, and MACD signal indicating a sell trend. The news analyst report, on the other hand, suggests a bullish short-term outlook for Bitcoin due to positive sentiment surrounding ETF approval, despite regulatory challenges and market volatility. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the effectiveness of a cautious and slightly conservative trading approach, focusing on long-term strategies and risk management.

Synthesizing the reports, it is evident that while there may be short-term bullish opportunities in Bitcoin, the overall market trend for ETH remains bearish. Therefore, it is crucial to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains to navigate the volatile cryptocurrency market successfully. Monitoring market trends closely, particularly regulatory uncertainties and institutional adoption, will be key to optimizing profitability.

Considering the bearish trend in ETH and the cautious approach recommended in the reflection analyst report, I would take a slightly conservative trading action with a confidence level of 0.3. This decision reflects my acknowledgment of the market trend, my strategic focus on risk management, and my commitment to long-term growth potential in the cryptocurrency market.

The biggest Bitcoin mining stocks, such as Riot Platforms (RIOT -8.65%) and Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA -10.51%), are now up more than 180% for the year as investors race to find companies that are highly leveraged to the price of Bitcoin.\n\nBut this single-minded focus on the price of Bitcoin may be missing a developing new story in the Bitcoin mining industry: the conversion of Bitcoin computing infrastructure into artificial intelligence (AI) computing infrastructure. Yes, that\'s right, a growing number of Bitcoin miners are looking to profit from the AI boom, although many investors have little idea this is happening. Here\'s what you need to know.\n\nWho\'s making the move into AI?\n\nTwo different Bitcoin miners caught my attention recently, and not for how much Bitcoin they were mining, how many new Bitcoin mining facilities they were launching, or how many new super-powerful Bitcoin mining rigs they were buying. Instead, they were announcing major moves to convert some of their Bitcoin computing infrastructure into AI computing infrastructure.\n\nThe two companies I have in mind are Bit Digital (BTBT -6.44%) and Hive Digital Technologies (HIVE -4.47%). In October, Hive Digital released further details on its plans to diversify into AI computing. The company is converting 38,000 Nvidia data center graphics processing units (GPUs), previously used to mine crypto, into an on-demand cloud service capable of servicing AI clients. Also in October, Bit Digital released plans to diversify into AI. The company plans to buy $35 million of new GPUs to service AI clients, with the aim of generating future cash flows to support its core mining operation.\n\nWhy the move into AI?\n\nThe biggest question, of course, is why these Bitcoin miners want to move into AI computing. After all, Bitcoin mining right now is incredibly profitable. The more Bitcoin they can mine, the more money they can make. And with the price of Bitcoin rebounding, they are quite literally minting money (if you consider cryptocurrency to be a form of money).\n\nBut there\'s an important consideration: The Bitcoin mining industry is incredibly cyclical and highly leveraged to the price of Bitcoin. Thus, in any year when Bitcoin is losing value, Bitcoin miners are highly unprofitable. For that reason, Bitcoin miners have always sought to diversify their businesses, which usually includes selling a mix of IT services to third-party clients.\n\nAnd don\'t forget about the upcoming Bitcoin halving, which CNBC has called an "extinction-level event" for the Bitcoin mining industry. This halving, which takes place in April 2024, will reduce the reward for mining Bitcoin by half. Put another way, Bitcoin miners will make only half as much as they did this year because their rewards are being cut by 50%.\n\nIt\'s easy to see why the halving event could force Bitcoin miners to seek a new strategic direction. Unless these miners dramatically boost their computing capacity or the price of Bitcoin doubles, they are likely going to be losing money in 2024. Some will surely go out of business unless they make changes now.\n\nPlus, did I mention that selling AI computing power is incredibly profitable -- at least for now? Bit Digital, for example, says that a new AI computing contract could generate as much as $250 million in revenue over a three-year period. By way of comparison, in all of 2022, Bit Digital posted just $32 million in Bitcoin mining revenue. And Hive Digital Technologies says that its new computing business is currently generating 15 times more revenue per megawatt than Bitcoin.\n\nBut will it work?\n\nGiven these numbers, it seems expanding into AI computing infrastructure could be a very profitable strategy. This assumes, of course, that AI computing power will continue to be in high demand, and that Bitcoin miners won\'t have to take on too much debt to finance the purchase of new computing equipment or retrofit existing infrastructure. If all goes according to plan (which it rarely does), Bitcoin mining stocks might have found a very clever way to remain profitable, even when the current rally in Bitcoin ends.\n\nHowever, if there\'s one caveat here, it\'s that investors have to be careful about investing in companies that are reinventing themselves to jump on an investment bandwagon. We\'ve seen this before, with companies going to great lengths to cash in on an emerging technology only to see it flop. The metaverse immediately comes to mind.\n\nSo if you\'re thinking of investing in a Bitcoin mining stock, make sure you do your due diligence. The next time these miners report earnings, take a closer look at how much money they are actually making from their noncore (i.e., non-Bitcoin) businesses and whether their future growth projections seem feasible.'}]

It’s a financial asset. It’s not the actual bitcoin itself.”\n\n“You had some fiat, you bought this derivative,” he explains. “The asset manager went and bought some bitcoin and they put it in a custodian and it sits there.”\n\n“If the BlackRock ETF gets too big,” he warns, “it could actually kill bitcoin because it’s just a bunch of immovable bitcoin that’s just sitting there.”\n\nTrading a sugar high today for calamity tomorrow?\n\nAdditionally, Hayes warns that the same entities could increase their grip on the network’s consensus mechanics by holding a large percentage of miners.\n\nCertain upgrades that might be required to ensure bitcoin remains a “rock solid cryptographically hard monetary asset” — particularly regarding encryption and privacy — are not necessarily aligned with traditional finance institutions, he says.\n\nRead more: DeFi is facing a ‘full frontal assault’ from regulators\n\n“So would they support that?” he asks. “Open question. I don’t know, but that’s what happens when you have these large passive investors.”\n\nHayes says bitcoin is the antithesis of statist money “that is here for us, the people, that have the ability to send money around the world.” But he wonders aloud what might happen if most of it winds up in the custody of one or few institutions.\n\nOf course, broader adoption of bitcoin will undoubtedly be great for the price in fiat terms, Hayes says. “But is it actually gonna be great for the usefulness of bitcoin?”\n\n“Are we, you know, gaining a sugar high today to only engender a massive calamity in the future? I don’t know.”\n\nHayes says people need to think longer term about the issue. “Yes, okay, ETF comes, price pumps to whatever it pumps to — but what’s the net result of one institution holding all this crypto?”\n\nDon’t miss the next big story – join our free daily newsletter.'}, {'id': 0, 'time': 'Sun, 05 Nov 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Bitcoin Has a Regulation Problem - Cryptocurrency - Investopedia', 'content': 'Regulation is among the key factors that affect the bitcoin price. The cryptocurrency’s rise has been arrested every time a government has cracked the policy whip, with countries taking varying approaches to bitcoin regulation.\n\nFor example, in November 2019, bitcoin sank to an all-time low when China accelerated a crackdown on cryptocurrency businesses, mirroring what happened when South Korea also made a move to regulate cryptocurrency trading back in 2017.\n\nConversely, whenever a regulatory "victory" emerges, prices surge temporarily. For instance, in October 2023, after years of Bitcoin Spot ETF denials from regulators, rumors of a Bitcoin Spot ETF approval caused a nearly $2,000 price spike and drop within a few hours.\n\nBy their very nature, cryptocurrencies are freewheeling, not beholden to country borders or specific agencies within a government. But this nature presents a problem to policymakers used to dealing with clear-cut definitions for assets. Here are two unresolved questions relating to Bitcoin regulation.\n\nKey Takeaways Bitcoin regulation can vary on both the national and local levels, depending on the country or geographical area.\n\nIn the U.S., the IRS treats cryptocurrency as property, while the CFTC considers it a commodity.\n\nMany cryptocurrency companies have avoided securities laws or requirements by offering utility or transactional tokens instead of security tokens.\n\n\n\nWho Should Regulate Cryptocurrencies?\n\nNothing is more symptomatic of confusion about cryptocurrencies than their classification by U.S. regulatory agencies and updates with former President Donald Trump\'s tax reform law. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) treats bitcoin as a commodity, while the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) treats it as property.\n\nThere is also a disparity in state and federal responses to cryptocurrency. While states have moved with alacrity and formulated rules for initial coin offerings (ICOSs) and smart contracts, federal responses are generally fueled by interpreting existing laws compared to how the cryptocurrencies are being used. For example, cryptocurrency startups in New York are required to obtain a BitLicense, which has stringent requirements regarding disclosures, before an ICO. Similarly, Arizona recognizes smart contracts. But as of November 2023, Congress hadn\'t enacted any legislation to guide regulators, although there have been several attempts.\n\nHow Should Cryptocurrencies Be Regulated?\n\nThe unique characteristics and global portability of cryptocurrencies present another problem for regulators.\n\nFor example, there are broadly four different types of tokens being traded on exchanges—transactional, utility, security, and governance tokens. As their name indicates, utility tokens serve an underlying purpose on a platform. For example, Augur, which is a betting platform that uses the Ethereum blockchain—its token, REP, is used on the blockchain as a stake (the bet). Such tokens are not subject to the SEC’s rules unless they are used as a security. On the other hand, security tokens represent equity or a share in a company and automatically fall under SEC purview. Governance tokens allow holders specific rights on a blockchain, and transactional tokens are designed to only be used in financial transactions.\n\nNot surprisingly, several tokens have circumvented existing regulations by declaring themselves utility tokens. Such startups have been publicly rebuked, but that has not stopped tokens with questionable business models from being listed on exchanges outside their native countries.\n\nIn response, international agencies such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have called for an international discussion and cooperation among regulators as far as cryptocurrencies are concerned. The EU, which has been welcoming of the cryptocurrency revolution, may possess an advantage over other territories because it controls a 28-member bloc. In June 2023, the EU Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation entered into force. MiCA defines cryptocurrency assets and which types are enforceable by regulators. This legislation answers how cryptocurrency should be regulated in the EU, but the U.S. and other countries are still working on solutions. Some countries have placed outright or partial bans on cryptocurrencies.\n\nCreating Regulations for Cryptocurrencies\n\nOn his Twitter page, the former head of blockchain practice at law firm Cooley, Marco Santori, called bitcoin a "legal platypus,” one that doesn’t fit neatly into established asset categories. However, the platypus may not be such a big problem for taxation or purposes within the United States.\n\nBitcoin and cryptocurrencies are actually no different than cash, stocks, bonds, or other financial instruments—they can represent the same things. In the U.S., regulations already exist that can apply to how an investor, business, or consumer treats them. Creating definitions and applying them to these virtual assets for regulatory pu...'}]

The news articles highlight concerns surrounding Bitcoin, including fraudulent activities by a company named Bitcoin Bonus, potential negative impacts of institutional custody on Bitcoin's utility and price, and regulatory challenges faced by cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. These issues could lead to increased skepticism and caution among investors, potentially causing a short-term dip in the market as trust and regulatory uncertainties persist. However, the long-term outlook for Ethereum (ETH) may benefit from these challenges as investors seek alternative cryptocurrencies with stronger security measures and regulatory compliance.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that there is a bearish sentiment in the ETH market due to the consistent decrease in open price, fluctuating market activity indicators, and the MACD signal being on sell. This suggests a potential for further price declines in the near future. 

On the other hand, the news analyst report presents a cautiously optimistic outlook for the market, particularly focusing on Bitcoin and its potential growth and adoption. Despite some concerns and uncertainties, there is a positive sentiment surrounding the anticipation of a Bitcoin ETF launch and the interest in Bitcoin market predictions.

Reflecting on the reports, it is clear that a slightly conservative approach focusing on long-term strategies and risk management has been effective in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. While there may be short-term fluctuations and uncertainties, prioritizing informed decisions based on reliable sources of information is crucial for optimizing profitability in the long run.

Considering the synthesized reports, the market trend appears to be leaning towards a cautious optimism for Bitcoin while showing a bearish sentiment for ETH. Therefore, it is advisable to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains and to manage risk effectively.

Based on this analysis, I would take a slightly conservative approach and decide to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.5. This decision reflects my acknowledgment of the bearish trend in the ETH market and my strategic choice to manage risk appropriately for potential long-term growth.
ACTION:
-0.5
DAILY RETURN:
-0.002077303945010933
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the market trend for ETH is currently bearish, with a consistent decrease in open price and various other metrics indicating a potential for further decline. The MACD signal also supports a sell trend for ETH.

On the other hand, the news analyst report presents a cautiously optimistic outlook for Bitcoin and its alternatives, highlighting potential growth opportunities amidst ongoing volatility and regulatory considerations. The sentiment towards Bitcoin and its alternatives appears to be positive, with key technical analysis pointing towards potential bullish moves.

In reflection of the reports, it is clear that a slightly conservative approach focusing on long-term strategies and risk management is crucial in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. While the short-term outlook for ETH may be bearish, the overall market trend for Bitcoin and its alternatives seems to be cautiously optimistic.

Considering the synthesized reports and the importance of long-term strategies over short-term gains, I would take a slightly conservative approach and assign a trading action of 0.3, indicating moderate confidence in the cautiously optimistic market trend for Bitcoin and its alternatives. This decision aligns with the need to prioritize risk management and informed decision-making for long-term profitability in the cryptocurrency market.
ACTION:
0.3
DAILY RETURN:
0.003513348185146148
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that there is a bearish trend in the ETH market, with a decrease in price and overall network activity. The high average fee and sell signal from the MACD indicator further support this bearish sentiment. On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights the potential impact of external factors such as Bitcoin's price rally, regulatory scrutiny, and the shift towards AI computing on the market trend for ETH.

In synthesizing these reports, it is clear that a slightly conservative approach focusing on long-term strategies and risk management is crucial in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. While short-term gains may be tempting, it is important to prioritize informed decision-making and consider the mixed signals from the reports.

Therefore, the clear market trend for ETH cryptocurrency is bearish in the short term, with potential increased volatility and regulatory attention. However, there may be opportunities for growth and diversification in the long term, especially with the shift towards AI computing by mining companies.

Considering the need for a long-term strategy and risk management, my trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.7. This decision reflects my cautious approach in response to the bearish market trend and the need to manage risk effectively for optimal profitability in the current cryptocurrency market environment.

In contrast, she emphasized that Bitcoin remains a fresh and evolving asset, with institutions only beginning to scratch the surface of its potential.\n\nWood\'s perspective aligns with the prevailing sentiment among younger investors who increasingly favor Bitcoin over gold. She pointed out that Bitcoin\'s allure lies in its technological novelty and the rising enthusiasm from millennials and Gen Z, who see it as a more attractive store of value compared to the yellow metal.\n\nIntriguingly, Wood made a notable observation regarding the role of both gold and Bitcoin as hedges against deflation. However, she noted that Bitcoin\'s recent performance suggests that it has been outshining its traditional counterpart.\n\nIn summary, Wood\'s sentiment reflects the evolving landscape of investments, with Bitcoin emerging as a powerful contender.\n\nTime will tell if more investors will follow suit as Bitcoin continues its recovery from 2022\'s brutal bear market.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.'}, {'id': 32, 'time': 'Mon, 06 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Was crypto on trial with Sam Bankman-Fried? - The Guardian', 'content': 'As the trial of the former crypto star and FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried began last month, headlines declared cryptocurrency was on trial too.\n\nBut when Bankman-Fried was found guilty on seven counts of wire fraud and money-laundering conspiracy on Thursday evening, after less than five hours of jury deliberations, bitcoin was trading at its highest price in a year.\n\nAs the scene in the courtroom played out, it became clear it wasn’t so much cryptocurrency on trial as the crypto bro himself – both Bankman-Fried and the archetype: the tech dilettante who believes he’s such an all-around genius that he can get rich with no expertise and an unkempt head of Einstein hair.\n\nDuring his three days on the stand, Bankman-Fried admitted to knowing nothing about cryptocurrency. He didn’t know anything about financial regulation, either. He said he believed FTX’s terms of service allowed Alameda Research, its closely associated hedge fund, to use FTX customer funds the way it did, actions prosecutors and the jury called fraud. Asked what he knew about crypto before starting FTX, he answered: “I had absolutely no idea how they worked. I just knew they were things you could trade.”\n\nWhile parts of the trial delved into the technical and financial structure of FTX’s grand scam, the prosecution spent much of its time questioning Bankman-Fried about his public persona. The assistant US attorney Danielle Sassoon wanted to puncture his unkempt boy-genius look, demonstrating to the jury that he used his appearance to woo investors and reassure customers that they were safe in his hands, when in fact they were far from it.\n\nThe prosecution’s vivisection of his image worked. Perhaps we’ve grown weary of the unkempt Mark Zuckerberg school of style. You can read the verdict as such: a hoodie in place of a suit jacket does not mean you are focused on your product to the exclusion of all else; it means you are an amateur. Bankman-Fried admitted during the trial that he was.\n\nThe question after his conviction is whether the entire industry will be found guilty, or just him.\n\nThe trial did not focus extensively on the technological or legal governance of cryptocurrency or blockchain as Bankman-Fried’s means to an end. Rather, the central question was whether the one-time mogul “misappropriated and embezzled” his customers’ money for his own high-flying ends. The crime is as old as banking itself, but it’s being committed with a new and unregulated technology.\n\nDamian Williams, the prosecutor in charge of the southern district of New York, spoke to this when he said to reporters after the conviction: “Sam Bankman-Fried perpetrated one of the biggest financial frauds in American history – a multibillion-dollar scheme designed to make him the king of crypto – but while the cryptocurrency industry might be new and the players like Sam Bankman-Fried might be new, this kind of corruption is as old as time.”\n\nA look at bitcoin today reveals the conflicted state crypto finds itself in. Because of Bankman-Fried, cryptocurrencies’ backers have never looked worse. Still, there are signs that bitcoin will endure: the original cryptocurrency is on the verge of a major regulatory victory in the expected approval of exchange-traded funds, including it.\n\nAlso, to industry insiders, the one-time boy wonder is not the avatar of cryptocurrency. They are not like him, they think. And they may have a point: cryptocurrency is not doomed because Bankman-Fried is. Bitcoin is valuable, especially if you bought some in January of this year: it’s up 110% year-to-date.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Thing Free daily newsletter Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We may trade bitcoin for the foreseeable future, we may trade it as long as we do stocks, and the true blockchain believers will continue to buoy its value. It’s likely to remain a symbol of libertarian rebellion against the financial system.\n\nFor true believers, the trial has simply been a distraction from the good work.

Against a backdrop of multiple bank collapses, a shaky economic macro and recent geopolitical issues, the leading crypto has more than doubled in value in 2023, with investors increasingly viewing bitcoin as a safe haven asset to lean on in troubled times. Of course, the growing mainstream acceptance represents a big change in attitude toward what was not long ago considered an extremely volatile and risky asset.\n\nBut the good news is that this year’s surge might just be the opening shot in a new bitcoin bull cycle. That is indeed the opinion of Bernstein analyst and digital asset expert Gautam Chhugani, who points out to investors the upcoming catalysts that could propel bitcoin to higher levels.\n\n“You may not like Bitcoin as much as we do, but a dispassionate view of Bitcoin as a commodity, suggests a turn of the cycle,” Chhugani noted. “A good idea is only as good as its timing – SEC approved ETFs by world’s top asset managers (BlackRock, Fidelity et al), seems imminent. Bitcoin ‘halving’ (BTC rewards half every 4 years) is due April ’24.”\n\nSo how high can bitcoin actually go? For the upcoming cycle, by mid-2025, Chhugani anticipates it will climb to a new high of $150,000, almost a 4.5x from current levels.\n\nInvestors looking to get in on the game can buy bitcoin directly but there are other ways to participate. “A winning Bitcoin miner,” implores Chhugani, “is a high-beta way to gain exposure.”\n\nThe bitcoin miners Chhugani refers to constitute the firms with the infrastructure to validate the bitcoin transactions and receive bitcoin as a reward for doing so and Chhugani believes a pair of mining companies are extremely well-positioned to make bank.\n\nBut it’s not only the Bernstein analyst who sees good times ahead for these names. According to the TipRanks database, both are rated as Strong Buys by the analyst consensus, too. Let’s take a closer look and see what makes them so.\n\nStory continues\n\nDon’t miss\n\nRiot Platforms (RIOT)\n\nBitcoin might have more than doubled in value this year but that return actually pales against the gains notched by miner Riot Platforms. The stock is up by 238% year-to-date. Investors have evidently taken to a well-capitalized miner boasting a healthy cash balance of $289 million, minimal debt and a balance sheet that compares favorably to that of other mining companies.\n\nRiot oversees two large-scale Bitcoin mining facilities in Texas and electrical switchgear engineering and fabrication operations in Denver, Colorado. And while it has taken a conservative stance regarding its balance sheet, it has still been focused on growth.\n\nIn June, the company disclosed that it is acquiring 33,280 MicroBT immersion-cooled miners at an approximate cost of $22 per Terra Hash. This addition will increase the mining fleet’s capacity by 7.6 E/Hs, ultimately reaching a total of 20.1 EH/s upon full deployment in 2024. This positioned Riot as one of the leading miners in the industry in terms of hash power. Furthermore, the company holds the option to procure an additional 66,560 miners at the same price, potentially elevating the total hash rate to 35.4 EH/s by 2025.\n\nThe company also makes use of selling electricity back to the grid, for which it sees the benefit of power credits. This has been particularly useful during the summer months, and in August alone, on the back of surging electricity prices in Texas, the company generated $24.2 million from power credits and an additional $7.4 million in demand response credits.\n\nFor Chhugani, it’s the anticipated growth along with the company remaining solely focused on its bitcoin mining endeavors – rather than chasing the shiny new thing as other miners have done – that makes Riot a top pick.\n\n“We like RIOT over any other miner,” he says. “We reckon winning the brutal game of mining is about positioning yourself to win big and being on the right side of the cycle. It is about backing yourself, investing in capacity counter cyclically and then winning big when the BTC price cycle heats up. We think Riot does all of this.”\n\n“What we like about Riot is that it’s also not distracted from chasing a new trend,” Chhugani goes on to add. “So it has stayed away from any pivots into AI computing or high performance computing. It is investing back in building more Bitcoin capacity, being counter cyclical and using the down market to negotiate the best equipment contracts with the mining manufacturers. Thus, it has locked prices for mining machines to expand capacity from 10.7 EH/S today to 35 EH/s by end of 2025. We think this counter cyclical focus on Bitcoin is going to win big.”\n\nThese comments underpin Chhugani’s Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating while his $15.6 price target suggests shares will climb 33% higher in the year ahead. (To watch Chhugani’s track record, click here)\n\nThat stance gets the backing of almost all of Chhugani’s colleagues. Barring one bear, all 7 other recent reviews are positive,...'}]

"""
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the market trend for ETH is currently bearish, with a consistent decrease in open price and various other metrics indicating a potential for further decline. The MACD signal also supports a sell trend for ETH.

On the other hand, the news analyst report presents a cautiously optimistic outlook for Bitcoin and its alternatives, highlighting potential growth opportunities amidst ongoing volatility and regulatory considerations. The sentiment towards Bitcoin and its alternatives appears to be positive, with key technical analysis pointing towards potential bullish moves.

In reflection of the reports, it is clear that a slightly conservative approach focusing on long-term strategies and risk management is crucial in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. While the short-term outlook for ETH may be bearish, the overall market trend for Bitcoin and its alternatives seems to be cautiously optimistic.

Considering the synthesized reports and the importance of long-term strategies over short-term gains, I would take a slightly conservative approach and assign a trading action of 0.3, indicating moderate confidence in the cautiously optimistic market trend for Bitcoin and its alternatives. This decision aligns with the need to prioritize risk management and informed decision-making for long-term profitability in the cryptocurrency market.
ACTION:

DAILY RETURN:
0.003513348185146148
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that there is a bearish trend in the ETH market, with a decrease in price and overall network activity. The high average fee and sell signal from the MACD indicator further support this bearish sentiment. On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights the potential impact of external factors such as Bitcoin's price rally, regulatory scrutiny, and the shift towards AI computing on the market trend for ETH.

In synthesizing these reports, it is clear that a slightly conservative approach focusing on long-term strategies and risk management is crucial in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. While short-term gains may be tempting, it is important to prioritize informed decision-making and consider the mixed signals from the reports.

Therefore, the clear market trend for ETH cryptocurrency is bearish in the short term, with potential increased volatility and regulatory attention. However, there may be opportunities for growth and diversification in the long term, especially with the shift towards AI computing by mining companies.

Considering the need for a long-term strategy and risk management, my trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.7. This decision reflects my cautious approach in response to the bearish market trend and the need to manage risk effectively for optimal profitability in the current cryptocurrency market environment.

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the market trend for ETH is currently bearish, with decreasing open price, unique addresses, transactions, and total value transferred. The MACD signal consistently indicates a sell trend, suggesting a potential further decline in price. 

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights concerns surrounding Bitcoin, which could lead to short-term market dips but potentially benefit Ethereum in the long run as investors seek alternative cryptocurrencies with stronger security measures and regulatory compliance.

In reflection, a slightly conservative approach focusing on long-term strategies and risk management has been effective in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. Prioritizing informed decisions based on reliable sources of information has led to successful outcomes.

Considering the mixed signals from the reports and the potential for increased volatility and regulatory scrutiny in the market, a slightly conservative trading approach is warranted to optimize profitability. Therefore, it is advisable to focus on long-term strategies over short-term gains.

It\'s about catalyzing a nation\'s shift to embrace Bitcoin from the ground up," said Noor El Bawab, CEO of Blink.\n\nThis partnership, along with Blink\'s new \'Buy & Sell Bitcoin\' feature, marks a substantial step forward in normalizing Bitcoin transactions in everyday life in El Salvador. These initiatives exemplify a concerted effort to harness Bitcoin\'s potential for efficient business operations and inclusive economic growth among communities and small businesses.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.'}]

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
The news articles suggest a mixed sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin miners selling more tokens than they minted during October's rally, potentially indicating profit-taking behavior. Additionally, Bitcoin transaction fees have reached a 5-month high, driven by increased interest in Ordinals inscriptions. On the positive side, Bitcoin accumulation is increasing as the supply reaches a historic low, supporting price stability. Furthermore, a supplier in El Salvador now accepts Bitcoin, indicating growing adoption in everyday transactions. Overall, the market trend may see some short-term volatility due to profit-taking and high transaction fees, but the long-term bullish outlook is supported by increasing Bitcoin accumulation and adoption.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that there is a bearish trend in the ETH market, with a decrease in price and overall network activity. The high average fee and sell signal from the MACD indicator further support this bearish sentiment. On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights the potential impact of external factors such as Bitcoin's price rally, regulatory scrutiny, and the shift towards AI computing on the market trend for ETH.

In synthesizing these reports, it is clear that a slightly conservative approach focusing on long-term strategies and risk management is crucial in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. While short-term gains may be tempting, it is important to prioritize informed decision-making and consider the mixed signals from the reports.

Therefore, the clear market trend for ETH cryptocurrency is bearish in the short term, with potential increased volatility and regulatory attention. However, there may be opportunities for growth and diversification in the long term, especially with the shift towards AI computing by mining companies.

Considering the need for a long-term strategy and risk management, my trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.7. This decision reflects my cautious approach in response to the bearish market trend and the need to manage risk effectively for optimal profitability in the current cryptocurrency market environment.
ACTION:

DAILY RETURN:

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the market trend for ETH is currently bearish, with decreasing open price, unique addresses, transactions, and total value transferred. The MACD signal consistently indicates a sell trend, suggesting a potential further decline in price. 

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights concerns surrounding Bitcoin, which could lead to short-term market dips but potentially benefit Ethereum in the long run as investors seek alternative cryptocurrencies with stronger security measures and regulatory compliance.

In reflection, a slightly conservative approach focusing on long-term strategies and risk management has been effective in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. Prioritizing informed decisions based on reliable sources of information has led to successful outcomes.

Considering the mixed signals from the reports and the potential for increased volatility and regulatory scrutiny in the market, a slightly conservative trading approach is warranted to optimize profitability. Therefore, it is advisable to focus on long-term strategies over short-term gains.

After reviewing the reports from the on-chain analyst, news analyst, and reflection analyst, it is clear that there are mixed signals in the market for ETH. The on-chain analyst report indicates a bearish trend for ETH with some potential for a short-term bullish reversal based on the recent MACD signal change. The news analyst report, on the other hand, suggests a bullish sentiment in the overall cryptocurrency market, particularly for Bitcoin, with positive outlooks and growth potential. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a conservative trading approach focusing on long-term strategies and risk management.

Taking into consideration the mixed signals and the emphasis on long-term strategies and risk management, it is prudent to prioritize a conservative approach in trading ETH. While there may be short-term opportunities for gains, the overall market trend is uncertain, and it is crucial to prioritize long-term profitability and risk management.

Therefore, I would take a cautious approach and assign a trading action of 0.3, reflecting a moderate level of confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.

Take a look bitcoin’s price, which has more than doubled since January.\n\nYet even that has done little to lift the fortunes of Robinhood. The company, whose app allows users to trade a number of cryptocurrencies, has lost four-fifths of its value since hitting a high in 2021. The stock fell another 15 per cent on Wednesday.\n\nThird-quarter earnings underscore how the app is losing its cachet among young traders.\n\nRobinhood’s funded accounts grew by 360,000 year-on-year to 23.3mn. But fewer customers are actively trading. The number of monthly active users fell 16 per cent to just over 10mn compared with the period for the prior year. That is about half the figure reached at the height of the retail trading frenzy two years ago.\n\nThe company’s woes are not shared by all its rivals. Brokerage platform Charles Schwab added 665,000 active accounts during its third quarter. Morgan Stanley, which owns E*Trade, added about 300,000 accounts during the September quarter.\n\nOverall, Robinhood’s transaction-based revenue fell 11 per cent to $185mn during the quarter, amid a sharp drop in crypto and equities trading. It now makes more from its customers’ idle cash. Segregated client accounts hold about $3.5bn of cash and securities. Revenue from net interest income nearly doubled year-on-year to $251mn. Even so, it booked a net loss of $85mn.\n\nThe boost from net interest income should soon diminish. The Federal Reserve appears to have finished raising interest rates. That will make for tougher comparatives in future. This is reflected in Robinhood’s lowly valuation of less than four times revenue. Charles Schwab manages five times.\n\nRobinhood has sought to reinvent itself by branching out into new products such as retirement accounts. But to do so it will compete against established brands like Charles Schwab and Fidelity. It needs to find more arrows in its quiver to draw in more active traders.'}, {'id': 45, 'time': 'Wed, 08 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Bitcoin Inscription Number 76 Sells for $60000 in Latest Sub-100 Ordinals Sale - Nasdaq', 'content': "BTC Inc., through its Ordinals-focused division Rare BTC, has brokered the sale of inscription number 76 for 1.7 BTC, which is equivalent to approximately $61,000 at the time of sale.\n\nThe sale is indicative of the active interest and perceived value in the Ordinals space, with Rare BTC positioning itself as a key player in the market for these distinctive bitcoin-based digital artifacts and unique satoshis.\n\nThe bitcoin ecosystem saw Ordinals generate a craze earlier this year, between May and June, with trading volume nearing that seen on Ethereum NFTs and leading to a spike in bitcoin fees. After a somewhat dull summer, Ordinals activity is back and already nearing the highs seen in May. Notably, yesterday public Ordinals trading volume in the preceding 24 hours surpassed Ethereum NFT’s for the first time.\n\nRare BTC specializes in the sale of rare satoshis and Sub-100 Ordinals, considered to be highly sought after in the digital collectibles space. This recent transaction follows a previous successful brokerage by Rare BTC, where inscription number 20 was sold for 3 BTC.\n\nThe company’s role in the Ordinals market includes connecting collectors, artists, and independent brokers to facilitate transactions.

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the market trend for ETH is currently bearish, with decreasing open price, unique addresses, transactions, and total value transferred.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights concerns surrounding Bitcoin, which could lead to short-term market dips but potentially benefit Ethereum in the long run as investors seek alternative cryptocurrencies with stronger security measures and regulatory compliance.

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a cautious and conservative approach focusing on long-term strategies and risk management is crucial in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. Balancing short-term gains with long-term profitability and risk mitigation is key to optimizing profitability.

Considering the synthesized reports, the overall market trend appears to lean towards a long-term bullish outlook despite short-term volatility. Therefore, I would take a slightly conservative approach and prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains. My trading action would be 0.5, reflecting moderate confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.

The cryptocurrency market is experiencing a mix of positive and negative developments.

That was the highest since May 5, 2022 — just before the TerraUSD stablecoin collapsed and ignited a daisy chain of failures across the cryptoasset space.

But if it comes earlier we are entering a window where a wave of approval orders for all current applications *COULD* occur,” tweeted Seyffart.'}, {'id': 8, 'time': 'Thu, 09 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ether tops $2,000 for the first time since April, bitcoin reaches an 18-month high - CNBC', 'content': 'ETF optimism had been building earlier in the morning, with bitcoin climbing and giving a big lift to crypto assets across the market to start the day. The rise in bitcoin price triggered a wave of short liquidations overnight, which propelled crypto prices higher, said Clara Medalie, head of research at crypto data provider Kaiko.\n\nThe website for Delaware\'s Division of Corporations showed that an iShares Ethereum Trust was registered on Thursday. A similar notice for the iShares Bitcoin Trust came on June 8, one week before BlackRock\'s filing for a bitcoin ETF. BlackRock declined to comment on the matter.\n\nEther was last higher by nearly 7.48% at $2,037.61, according to Coin Metrics. Meanwhile, bitcoin added 2.67% to trade at $36,574.83. Earlier, it climbed as high as $37,970, its highest level since May 2022.\n\nThe price of ether jumped Thursday, topping the key $2,000 level for the first time since April, after BlackRock took initial steps toward filing for a spot ether ETF.\n\n"Over the past year, crypto markets have been desperately searching for a catalyst amid a sea of bad news, and the ETF news have been a welcome respite," she said. "Should [an ETF approval] come, we may see another big surge, or we could be witnessing the extent of it right now. Ultimately, it is too early to tell if the rally has legs, but things look promising."\n\nHowever, with the exception of ether, prices across the crypto market retreated midday. Ryan Rasmussen, analyst at Bitwise Asset Management, noted that leverage and open interest ballooned on the sharp move towards $38,000 and then evaporated almost instantly on the pullback.\n\n"That\'s a reflection of traders on both sides — bulls and bears — getting whipsawed by the sharp price movements," he said. "Any time leverage builds like that in either direction, it\'s at risk of getting wiped out. I think it\'s fair to expect more volatility as prices rise — bull markets don\'t go up in a straight line."\n\nBitcoin has seen $134.41 million in short liquidations over the past 24 hours, according to crypto data provider CoinGlass, and $41.12 million in long liquidations in the same period.\n\nOther crypto assets rode the bitcoin price wave Thursday, also coming off their highs of the day. Solana , one of the biggest outperformers in crypto this year, added 2.69% after jumping 11% earlier. Most other tokens gave back earlier gains and ended the day flat.\n\nSeparately, FTT, the token tied to the now defunct FTX, spiked by 51% after SEC chair Gary Gensler told CNBC a revival of the exchange could work if new leadership does so with a clear understanding of the law.\n\nIn equities, shares of crypto services provider Coinbase and bitcoin proxy Microstrategy gained 5.1% and 4.1%, respectively. Among the bitcoin miners, Marathon Digital was up 8%, while Riot was flat. Both stocks gave back double digit gains.\n\n—CNBC\'s Jesse Pound contributed reporting.\n\nDon\'t miss these stories from CNBC PRO:\n\nCorrection: The price of bitcoin topped $37,000 for the first time since May 2022.

Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre standing by on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with the latest. Jared.\n\nJARED BLIKRE: Yes, 37,000, really impressive. Let's go to the Wi-Fi interactive and talk about this Grayscale Bitcoin, which is about to become an ETF. The SEC lost that court case and there are a bunch of other spot ETFs-- spot Bitcoin ETFs that are just waiting to come into the market from BlackRock and a bunch of different ETF providers. So lots of hype surrounding that.\n\nAnd if we take a look at the chart, you can see 37,500 and change here. We have really accelerated off of this base here. So not much was happening for a few months. And then, suddenly, we got what some people are calling a God candle that would be right here. And now, we're clearing resistance. 35,000 was a big number. Now we're up to 37,000.\n\nLet me just show you a three-year chart so we can see where some of the price memory is. We're really in the thick of it right now at the lower end down here. But you can see tons of price memory all the way up to about 65,000-70,000. So the short story is there's a long way to go.\n\nBut, if Bitcoin is emerging finally from this crypto winter then there's lots of enthusiasm behind it, and perhaps we can clear a lot of these major hurdles. It was only yesterday, I was talking about the FTC's, perhaps, rising from the ashes, there are a number of potential suitors there. Three of which are leading the negotiations. One of which is headed by Tom Farley, who used to be the President of the New York Stock Exchange right here.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut back to the Wi-Fi interactive. Let me just show you what's happened over the last three days so you can really appreciate some of the outsized move that we've seen from some of the smaller tokens. FTT token. That's up 75%.\n\nLet me show you a one year chart. And it kind of looks like a sinusoidal pattern here. Periodic bouts of enthusiasm. I guess not worried that it's going to go to zero at least. We've seen this play out over the last year.\n\nBut if I put a three-year chart, you can really see the damage that was done to this token. It's basically down over 90% over the last two years. There you go, 96%-97%. All told here. It's looking good for the risk market it's not just Bitcoin and crypto, which is being seeing a lot of love.\n\nLet me go to some of our leading markets. If we go over the last three days. Actually, let me pull it up for the last seven that's going to take us back to, I believe, last Wednesday's Fed announcement, which really started the risk engine juice. ARK Invest is up 17.6%.\n\nCannabis up 12%. Gambling up 10%. So this is really all about risk on.

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
The recent surge in Bitcoin's price, reaching above $37,000 and hitting an 18-month high, is attributed to growing optimism surrounding the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This positive sentiment has also lifted other cryptocurrencies, with Ether surpassing $2,000 for the first time since April. The market is eagerly anticipating potential ETF approvals, which could lead to further price increases and market growth.

REASONING:
After reviewing the reports from the on-chain analyst, news analyst, and reflection analyst, it is clear that there are mixed signals in the market for ETH. The on-chain analyst report indicates a bearish trend for ETH with some potential for a short-term bullish reversal based on the recent MACD signal change. The news analyst report, on the other hand, suggests a bullish sentiment in the overall cryptocurrency market, particularly for Bitcoin, with positive outlooks and growth potential. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a conservative trading approach focusing on long-term strategies and risk management.

Taking into consideration the mixed signals and the emphasis on long-term strategies and risk management, it is prudent to prioritize a conservative approach in trading ETH. While there may be short-term opportunities for gains, the overall market trend is uncertain, and it is crucial to prioritize long-term profitability and risk management.

Therefore, I would take a cautious approach and assign a trading action of 0.3, reflecting a moderate level of confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.

*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is experiencing volatility with fluctuating trends in unique addresses, total transactions, average fees, total value transferred, and MACD signals. This uncertainty is further supported by the news analyst report, which highlights the positive sentiment in the market due to Bitcoin's surge and potential ETF approvals, but also warns of a possible pullback.

Reflecting on my trading performance, I have found that a slightly conservative approach focusing on long-term profitability and risk management has been effective in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. By closely monitoring key indicators and staying informed on market developments, I have been able to make strategic decisions that have led to successful outcomes.

In conclusion, the overall market trend appears uncertain with potential for further volatility. Therefore, a slightly conservative trading approach is warranted to manage risk effectively and optimize profitability in the long run. I will take a cautious approach and assign a trading action of 0.3, reflecting my moderate confidence in the market trend and my strategic decision to prioritize long-term gains over short-term fluctuations.

But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last three years have been less than pleasing. In fact, the share price is down 21% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return.\n\nNow let's have a look at the company's fundamentals, and see if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Bitcoin Group\n\nThere is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\n\nBitcoin Group saw its EPS decline at a compound rate of 16% per year, over the last three years. In comparison the 8% compound annual share price decline isn't as bad as the EPS drop-off. So the market may not be too worried about the EPS figure, at the moment -- or it may have previously priced some of the drop in. With a P/E ratio of 65.60, it's fair to say the market sees a brighter future for the business.\n\nThe image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).\n\nWe know that Bitcoin Group has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nIt's nice to see that Bitcoin Group shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 9.1% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. That certainly beats the loss of about 3% per year over the last half decade. We generally put more weight on the long term performance over the short term, but the recent improvement could hint at a (positive) inflection point within the business. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Take risks, for example - Bitcoin Group has 2 warning signs we think you should be aware of.\n\nStory continues\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

Lightning Network has often been advertised as a game-changer in the cryptocurrency's evolution. It is designed to speed up transaction processing times and decrease the associated costs of Bitcoin's blockchain. The lightning network was conceived by two developers, Thaddeus Dryja and Joseph Poon in 2015.\n\nAlthough the Lightning Network has experienced growth and development since its inception, challenges remain. Bitcoin's price fluctuations have prevented the crypto from becoming a widespread payment method for consumer and business transactions. Also, there are costs involved in using Lightning Network.\n\nHere, we highlight what the Lightning Network is designed to solve and three problems that it faces. Also, we review recent developments that could impact and improve the network in the future.\n\nKey Takeaways The Lightning Network is a second layer added to Bitcoin's network, enabling transactions to be done off of the blockchain.\n\nThe Lightning Network is designed to speed up transaction processing times and decrease the associated costs of Bitcoin's blockchain.\n\nHowever, the Lightning Network still has costs associated with it and can be susceptible to fraud or malicious attacks.\n\nBitcoin's price swings may prevent the crypto from becoming a popular payment method, limiting the use of the Lightning Network.\n\nUnderstanding the Lightning Network\n\nAs Bitcoin gains transaction volume, more are processed on its blockchain network. This presents problems because the blockchain, in its current state, isn't designed to scale or process the volume of transactions being made.\n\nBitcoin's Scalability Issue\n\nThe Bitcoin blockchain and network are designed to process one block about every 10 minutes. Transactions are sent into a work queue, where they are prioritized by how much the user paid in fees. The more transactions there are, the larger the queue is.\n\nAs a result, Bitcoin has faced a scalability issue, meaning there are challenges when the network tries to process more transactions simultaneously. For Bitcoin to process more data, the network needs to scale, allowing more transactions to be processed quicker and more efficiently.\n\nThis network latency has led to higher transaction fees as miners take longer to validate transactions because users pay more to prioritize them.\n\nWhat It Is Designed to Do\n\nThe Lightning Network is a separate blockchain that works in conjunction with Bitcoin's blockchain. In a nutshell, the Lightning Network allows participants to transfer bitcoins between one another much quicker using payment channels. Channels can remain open for further payments or closed when a transaction is complete. Instead of waiting for the main network to get through its work queue for the payment to transfer (sometimes taking more than an hour), the Lightning Network lets users send and receive payments in seconds.\n\n1. It Does Not Solve Bitcoin’s Transaction Fee Problem\n\nLightning Network is often touted as a solution to the problem of Bitcoin’s rising transaction fees. Its proponents claimed that transaction fees, one of the direct consequences of Bitcoin’s clogged network, would come down after the technology took transactions off the main blockchain.\n\nBut Bitcoin’s congestion is among several factors influencing its transaction fees. When the Lightning Network was integrated in 2018, expectations for reduced costs and faster transactions were high among users—but as the graph below shows, average Bitcoin transaction fees increased. There could be many reasons for this, but it demonstrates how ineffective the Lightning Network was at reducing fees.\n\nBlockchain.com\n\nLightning Network Fees\n\nIn addition to standard on-chain transaction charges, users are charged for opening a channel with a routing node. The routing node operator charges fees for providing the Lightning channel to the main network. Fees consist of a base fee and a rate, both chosen by the operator. The base fee remains consistent unless manually changed, and the rate is a percentage of the transaction value.\n\nSo, a node operator could set the base fee at one satoshi and the rate at 0.1%. If a user wanted to send 1,000 satoshi via this node, they would need to pay 2 satoshi to the node (fees on the Lightning Network can be measured in increments of milli-satoshi, so the payments can actually be very small).\n\nLightning fees are generally low because hosting a node is a competitive endeavor. Fees must be low enough to attract users but high enough to bring some benefit to the host. If they are too low, there might be no reason to operate a node—if they are too high, users will likely choose a lower-priced node.\n\nInterestingly (and regardless of node fees), by design, the Lightning Network incorporates fees to try and lower overall fees.\n\n2.

And now we\'re getting ourselves into the period of the first year of the bull cycle," van de Poppe said in his latest note.\n\nSee Also: Bitcoin’s Current Uptick Just The Start, Benzinga Pinpoints 3 Major Catalysts Ahead\n\nBitcoin has surged over 38% in the last month alone, crossing the $37,000 mark, so the question among investors and traders who have missed out on the rally is whether now is a good time to buy Bitcoin.\n\nGoing by van de Poppe\'s analysis, the Bitcoin rally still has legs — he said that there is still a potential upside of nearly 50% from the existing level of $37,000.\n\n"Most likely, the high is going to be around $50,000 to $55,000," he said.\n\n"At this point, the confirmation of the bear market to be over is almost close to 100%, especially with the breakout of $28,000 and holding the 200-week EMA (exponential moving average) for Bitcoin," he explained.\n\nAccording to van de Poppe\'s charts, one Bitcoin cycle is spread across four years: one-year bear market, one-year accumulation and a two-year bull run. With the bear and accumulation phases now over, van de Poppe believes there are two years of Bitcoin bull run ahead of us.\n\n"Coming two years are going to be great," van de Poppe said.\n\nMy friends, buy the dips.Coming two years are going to be great.\n\n— Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) November 10, 2023\n\nAnother factor that is playing into the recent strength in the king of crypto is the Bitcoin halving event, anticipated to take place in 2024.\n\nThis will halve the rewards for mining new blocks of Bitcoin, reducing the rate at which new Bitcoins are mined. This will, in turn, create scarcity and lead to a price appreciation.\n\nThe confluence of spot Bitcoin ETFs, Bitcoin halving event and a perceived undervaluation are all pointing at a potential bull run ahead, even though crypto critics like Peter Schiff are not convinced.\n\nRead Next: Welcome To ‘The Acceleration Phase’: Analyst Predicts An 88% Increase For Bitcoin\n\nPhoto by 99Art on Shutterstock\n\n© 2023 Benzinga.com.

While Gold and the US Dollar have long held their positions as stalwart players, Bitcoin has boldly entered the race, establishing itself as an emerging asset class. Each of these three assets possesses distinct characteristics and potential benefits, creating a dynamic landscape reflecting wealth and investment evolving nature. Let’s delve into the comparative study of Bitcoin, USD , and gold over the past decade.Gold, a trusted store of value for centuries, has been a staple in the financial markets since the 1970s. However, the landscape changed significantly with the introduction of the first gold exchange-traded fund (ETF), Gold Bullion Securities . Launched on March 28, 2003, on the Australian Securities Exchange by ETF Securities and its major stakeholder, Graham Tuckwell, this event marked a significant evolution in gold investment.Historically, gold has demonstrated its resilience by serving as a hedge against inflation amid economic uncertainties. This characteristic has established Gold as a preferred choice for investors looking to safeguard their portfolios. Despite encountering short-term fluctuations, Gold has maintained its reputation as a stable investment, particularly appealing to risk-averse investors. The enduring popularity of Gold as an investment option underscores its time-tested role in providing stability amid the dynamic currents of the financial markets.In contrast, Bitcoin debuted in the aftermath of the 2008 recession. Despite being a relatively young player in the financial arena, it has gained a lot of popularity among investors, garnering usage by approximately 4% of the global population. Over the past few years, Bitcoin has witnessed a surge in retail and institutional interest. The submission of Bitcoin spot ETF applications by major corporations such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale signals a surge in momentum. Furthermore, the regulatory landscape, once characterized by ambiguity, is gradually evolving to accommodate and address the challenges posed by this innovative digital asset.The US dollar has been the world's primary reserve currency since the conclusion of World War II, making it the most widely utilized currency in international trade. The considerable global demand for dollars not only facilitates the United States in borrowing money at a lower cost but also grants the nation leverage in using its currency strategically as a diplomatic tool. However, this advantageous position is not without its drawbacks.As the world's primary reserve currency, the USD has been a lynchpin in global finance for decades, influenced by many factors, including interest rates, economic growth, and geopolitical events. Despite its pivotal role, the USD is not immune to challenges, as it has witnessed periods of inflation and depreciation, threatening its purchasing power over time. This dynamic nature underscores the need for a nuanced understanding of the complexities and vulnerabilities associated with the world's leading reserve currency.Gold is renowned for its stability and has historically been considered a safe-haven asset. While the price of Gold can fluctuate, it generally experiences less volatility compared to Bitcoin. Investors often turn to gold as a hedge against market turbulence during economic uncertainty.On the other hand, the US Dollar typically experiences lower volatility than Bitcoin but more than Gold. As discussed above, the stability of the USD is influenced by various global economic factors.When we talk about Bitcoin, in comparison with Gold and USD, it is obvious that it has higher volatility, being a nascent and emerging asset class. Over the past decade, the LBMA Gold Index has had an annualized volatility of almost 14%, roughly one-tenth the annualized volatility of Bitcoin. However, the volatility of Bitcoin is reducing drastically; for instance, over the past year, Bitcoin's volatility was only 49%. This highlights that while cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin continue to be riskier investments, the markets are becoming more mature and less risky with time.When considering potential returns, Bitcoin emerges as the clear frontrunner, outpacing Gold and the US Dollar (USD) by a considerable margin. The staggering Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of Bitcoin stands at an impressive 47% over a past 10 year period, showcasing a remarkable performance that dwarfs the growth rates of Gold and USD. To put this into perspective, Bitcoin's CAGR is nearly six times that of Gold and an astounding fifteen times greater than that of USD over the same period.Given its historical performance, investors seeking opportunities for substantial returns may find Bitcoin an attractive prospect. However, it's crucial to acknowledge that higher returns come with higher risks, and the volatility associated with Bitcoin must be carefully considered in the broader context o..."}]

This surge coincided with Bitcoin's price spiking to over $37,000 on the same day, driven by heightened expectations surrounding the potential approval of a U.S. spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe upswing in mining revenue is attributed to the combined impact of Bitcoin's price increase and heightened network activity. Lane Kasselman, President of Blockchain.com, pointed out that increased network congestion results in higher transaction fees, contributing to miners' earnings. While network congestion in May was influenced by demand for Ordinals—a concept akin to NFTs—the current surge is primarily linked to the escalating price of Bitcoin.\n\nThe anticipation of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF approval has played a pivotal role in the recent price rally. The SEC, known for historically rejecting Bitcoin ETF applications, is facing a unique situation with the expiration of deadlines for rebuttal comments on multiple pending ETF applications, potentially leading to the simultaneous approval of 12 Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."}, {'id': 7, 'time': 'Sun, 12 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Hackers claim to have compromised bankrupt Bitcoin ATM firm Coin Cloud: Report - The Block', 'content': 'An unidentified hacking group claims to have stolen 70,000 customer selfies and sensitive personal information for 300,000 customers of Coin Cloud, a Bitcoin ATM firm which operated over 4,000 machines in the U.S. and Brazil until its bankruptcy filing this February. The hacking group also claims to have stolen the source code to Coin Cloud\'s backend system, according to a post on X from cybersecurity expert vx-underground.\n\nThe post includes redacted images, purportedly depicting the customer selfies and personal identifying information the group has accessed, which includes the Social Security numbers of customers along with their name, address, date of birth, occupation, phone number, and more, according to the report.\n\nVx-underground told The Block that the unidentified hacker was sharing the claims in private channels and that the leaked database may be posted online soon.

He is published regularly in the New York Times and is known for his skepticism of cryptocurrency and blockchain.\n\nKey Takeaways Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman has never been a fan of Bitcoin or cryptocurrency.\n\nKrugman argues that these digital tokens serve no economic purpose and that their valuation is tenuous.\n\nWhether or not Bitcoin is genuinely a bubble remains to be seen, but many prominent thinkers strongly disagree with Krugman\'s position.\n\nUnderstanding Paul Krugman\'s Position\n\nPaul Krugman bases his opinions and stance on cryptocurrencies on his years of economics study, teaching, and expertise.\n\nIn a 2018 New York Times op-ed titled "Transaction Costs and Tethers: Why I\'m a Crypto Skeptic," crypto-skeptic Paul Krugman wrote:\n\n“What problem does this technology solve? What does it do that other, much cheaper and easier-to-use technologies can’t do just as well or better? I still haven’t heard a clear answer."\n\nThe Nobel Prize-winning economist\'s sentiments haven\'t changed much since the 2018 op-ed he filed from vacation in Europe, a result of his pondering of bitcoin and blockchain while "hiking and biking in various parts of Europe."\n\n\n\nThat year, he stated that it set the monetary system back by 300 years when gold was the primary form of exchange and that there didn\'t seem to be a clear upside to this regression. Krugman still made the claim three years later:\n\n"Because Bitcoin and its relatives haven’t managed to achieve any meaningful economic role, what happens to their value is basically irrelevant to those of us not playing the crypto game."\n\nMultiple Strikes Against Bitcoin?\n\nThroughout his published op-eds, Krugman describes why more caution and regulation are needed for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.\n\nCosts\n\nThe transaction costs for gold are high because it\'s heavy and bulky and is considerably expensive to store. Fiat currencies incur lower, but still significant, transaction costs because they are paper-based. Subsequent shifts towards checks and credit and debit cards have further decreased the need and costs for paper-based currency.\n\nIn turn, this has led to them being widely adopted by countries around the world. That they are widely accepted provides further impetus for their use. In contrast, bitcoin has significant transaction costs in the form of its energy requirements. It is also not widely accepted, and that further increases the costs required to conduct practical commerce using Bitcoin.\n\nLack of Tethering\n\nBitcoin has a lack of tethering capability. In practical terms, this means there are no real backstops available to it as they are to paper money and gold. Government backing provides credibility to paper money. Gold has practical applications in jewelry and industry, which provide "a weak but real tether to the real economy."\n\nBecause of its digital and stateless nature, bitcoin has neither a physical application nor a central authority to vouch for its status as a medium of exchange. "If speculators were to have a collective moment of doubt, suddenly fearing that Bitcoins were worthless, well, Bitcoins would become worthless," writes Krugman.\n\nIn a June 2021 op-ed, along with the opinion that stablecoins like TerraUSD start as a way to keep third parties out of transactions but eventually end up needing them to operate as a stablecoin, Krugman furthered his stance on a lack of tethering, pointing to TerraUSD\'s loss of its peg to the dollar and eventual collapse. As it turns out, the only way to truly be stable, pegged, or tethered is to hold an amount of currency (or an equal value of property) equal to the total intended value of the cryptocurrency (such as $1,000 for 1,000 tokens).\n\nIt\'s a Bubble\n\nTo be sure, Krugman has maintained a steady position against Bitcoin. In 2018, Krugman said that the cryptocurrency was an obvious bubble. He said its prices were rising because "Early investors in a bubble make a lot of money as new investors are drawn in, and those profits pull in even more people. The process can go on for years before something—a reality check, or simply exhaustion of the pool of potential marks—brings the party to a sudden, painful end."\n\nNo Hard Evidence to Oppose His Opinions\n\nHe has argued in a similar manner in more recent op-eds, reiterating his belief that Bitcoin is a scam, bubble, and designed by people who don\'t understand the fundamentals of a fiat currency system. Many of his opponents respond with, in his words, "technobabble," which doesn\'t offer any oppositional evidence. Some of his main points over the years are:\n\nPonzi and pyramid schemes excel where there is a strong narrative, and Krugman believes that the "narrative" is where crypto "really excels."\n\nBitcoin has turned out not to be inflation-proof.\n\nMost investors buy cryptocurrencies through exchanges, which take their m...'}, {'id': 9, 'time': 'Sun, 12 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Rebuild or retreat? Crypto faces tough choices after FTX - Financial Times', 'content': 'Print this page\n\nHours after Sam Bankman-Fried, co-founder of FTX and poster child of the crypto industry, was convicted of fraud and money laundering in New York, one of his leading venture capital backers had his say.\n\n“Immediately after FTX collapsed, we extensively reviewed our due diligence process and evaluated our 18-month working relationship with Sam Bankman-Fried,” said Alfred Lin, partner at Sequoia Capital. “We concluded that we had been deliberately misled and lied to.”\n\nCrypto sceptics would argue that Lin was hardly the first to be taken in. Ever since bitcoin was created in 2009, the industry has variously been associated with illicit trading, such as the now defunct Silk Road marketplace, or business failures such as the 2014 collapse of Mt Gox, which at its peak handled almost three-quarters of all bitcoin in circulation.\n\nAt the height of his power, Bankman-Fried was seen as the industry’s most likely route to respectability. Alongside Sequoia, FTX boasted mainstream backers such as Tiger Global, Singapore’s state-owned Temasek and the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan.\n\nIn Washington, Bankman-Fried testified before congressional committees, supported more regulation and became a major political donor.\n\nIn the Bahamas, where FTX was based, Prime Minister Philip Davis championed the company as a marquee acquisition as the Caribbean country’s economy sought its next economic boost.\n\nMeanwhile, FTX secured celebrity endorsements and signed sponsorship deals with Major League Baseball, the Miami Heat basketball franchise and the International Cricket Council. It filmed a Super Bowl advertisement with actor and producer Larry David.\n\nA giant screen shows Sam Bankman-Fried at a cryptocurrency conference in the Bahamas © FT montage\n\nBut on November 2, a 12-person New York jury needed less than five hours to reach unanimous agreement that Bankman-Fried was guilty of seven charges.\n\n“Sam Bankman-Fried perpetrated one of the biggest financial frauds in American history,” said US attorney for the Southern District of New York Damian Williams. “This kind of fraud, this kind of corruption is as old as time, and we have no patience for it.”\n\nAs crypto’s former leading light contemplates a possible lengthy jail sentence, the industry he championed could go one of two ways: either it collectively regroups and tries — all over again — to be accepted in the world of mainstream finance, or it falls back on its longstanding image as a niche market for speculators, day traders and those who fervently believe money should remain separate from the state.\n\nFor John Reed Stark, former chief of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s office of internet enforcement, the trial verdict is “a death knell for crypto, Web 3 and blockchain.”\n\n“This is an industry that has run its course,” he says. “If it all went away tomorrow, it wouldn’t impact a single person on the planet other than the speculator.”\n\nBut others believe the industry can recover from the debacle of the Bankman-Fried trial and become a part of mainstream finance.\n\n“Crypto’s public image is at an all-time low, but the industry isn’t done yet,” says Charles Storry, head of growth at crypto futures index platform Phuture.\n\nAn inglorious history\n\nThe ignominious conclusion of Bankman-Fried’s career follows more than a decade of non-compliance with traditional financial rules, run-ins with regulators around the world, and accusations that cryptocurrencies are used to fund terrorism and the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, the computing power needed to “mine” crypto assets like bitcoin generates a carbon footprint roughly equivalent to a country the size of Ukraine.\n\nFTX’s bankruptcy in 2022 capped off a crisis of confidence that resulted in popular digital assets such as bitcoin and ether losing more than half their value. Other once prominent firms like Terraform Labs and Three Arrows Capital also collapsed.\n\nIn response, lawmakers and regulators in multiple jurisdictions stepped up their oversight of the sector to unprecedented levels during 2023. US regulators have issued a blitz of enforcement cases and lawsuits against some of the biggest crypto companies still standing. They include US-listed Coinbase — which is facing an SEC lawsuit after allegedly violating securities laws — and Binance, FTX’s great rival and the world’s largest crypto exchange by some distance.\n\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission sued Binance in March, alleging it had illegally accessed US customers and that it knew it facilitated potentially illegal activities.\n\nBinance is now the biggest crypto exchange but the company and its chief executive, Changpeng Zhao, face regulatory action from both the CFTC and SEC © FT montage/Reuters\n\nThree months later, the SEC filed a lawsuit of its own against Binance, alleging that it had mixed customers’ cash with a separate trading firm owned by its chief executive Changpeng Zhao.

REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is experiencing volatility with fluctuating trends in unique addresses, total transactions, average fees, total value transferred, and MACD signals. This uncertainty is further supported by the news analyst report, which highlights the positive sentiment in the market due to Bitcoin's surge and potential ETF approvals, but also warns of a possible pullback.

Reflecting on my trading performance, I have found that a slightly conservative approach focusing on long-term profitability and risk management has been effective in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. By closely monitoring key indicators and staying informed on market developments, I have been able to make strategic decisions that have led to successful outcomes.

In conclusion, the overall market trend appears uncertain with potential for further volatility. Therefore, a slightly conservative trading approach is warranted to manage risk effectively and optimize profitability in the long run. I will take a cautious approach and assign a trading action of 0.3, reflecting my moderate confidence in the market trend and my strategic decision to prioritize long-term gains over short-term fluctuations.

After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing fluctuations in key indicators such as unique addresses, total transactions, average fees, total value transferred, and MACD signals. This uncertainty is further supported by the news analyst report, which highlights mixed sentiments towards Bitcoin and its related companies, indicating potential challenges in the market.

In light of this information, it is evident that a slightly conservative approach focusing on long-term profitability and risk management is crucial in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. By considering the mixed sentiment in the news analyst report and closely monitoring key indicators, traders can make strategic decisions that prioritize long-term gains over short-term fluctuations.

Therefore, the clear market trend suggests that a slightly conservative trading approach is warranted to manage risk effectively and optimize profitability in the long run. While short-term gains may be possible, it is important to prioritize long-term strategies to navigate the uncertain market conditions successfully.

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing volatility and indecision, as indicated by fluctuating trends in unique addresses, coinbase transactions, average fees, total size used, total value transferred, and MACD signals. This suggests that short-term trading strategies may be risky due to the uncertain market direction.

On the other hand, the news analyst report paints a positive outlook for Bitcoin, with a bullish sentiment driven by factors such as the potential approval of a Bitcoin ETF, the upcoming halving event, and perceived undervaluation. This indicates a favorable market trend for cryptocurrencies in general, including ETH.

In reflecting on the recent trading performance, it is evident that a slightly conservative approach focusing on long-term profitability and risk management has been effective in navigating the volatile ETH market. The importance of balancing risk and reward, prioritizing long-term gains over short-term fluctuations, and staying informed on market developments is emphasized.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is advisable to adopt a slightly conservative trading approach to manage risk effectively and optimize profitability in the long run.

Here we are, just a brief time later, andbitcoin pricesare now above the $37,000, marking its highest level since May of 2022.\n\nWhat’s Behind Bitcoin’s Move Higher?\n\nThe factors behind its recent price move are multifaceted.\n\nEnd of Rate Hike Cycle - Hopes that the Federal Reserve finishes increasing interest rates sparks a rally in all risk-sensitive assets. Digital Gold – Bitcoin’s price dynamic is somewhat unique in that it also benefits from global instability along with other hard assets like gold. The conflict in the Middle East has sparked a round of “digital gold” trades as a safe-haven, store-of-value play. Tight Supply – The surge in near-term demand comes at a time when bitcoin miners are selling as much as they can mine these days ahead of the so-called “halving” next year, and long-term HODL’ers (Hold on for Dear Lifers) are unwilling to give up their tokens. Top miners sold more tokens than they produced last month, cashing in on October’s price rally, creating a bitcoin liquidation-to-production ratio last month of 104%. April 2024 Halving – April’s “halving,” as the name implies, will reduce the amount of tokens going forward, making the reward less valuable for miners after the halving but more valuable to long-term holders due to a halving of supply. Historically, most of bitcoin’s gains come directly after halvings, which only occur every four years. Spot ETF Filings – Certainly another factor in bitcoin’s recent rise is the increasing likelihood that the SEC will approve a spot version of a U.S. Bitcoin ETF, creating more demand at a time of limited supply. And a U.S. spot ether approval could be in the works as well.\n\nCrypto Spring in the Air?\n\nAll of this has led investors coming out of the Crypto Winter to be hopeful that Crypto “Spring” is in the air. For those unfamiliar with the seasonal analogies, the four phases of cryptocurrency prices correspond to the four seasons of the year. During the period preceding each halving, the price of bitcoin generally recovers from its lowest price point.\n\nMorgan Stanley put out a nice checklist to help investors identify if it is indeed a “growing season”. A 50% price increase from bitcoin’s low is one of those signals that a trough level has been reached, but as mentioned above, there are a lot more dynamics in play here external to seasonality. Over the last year, bitcoin and Ethereum pricing are up considerably, up 98% and 59%, but regulatory uncertainty remains.\n\nWhen Will We Get a Spot Bitcoin ETF?\n\nWe are currently in an eight-day window between November 9-17, where potentially all 12 spot Bitcoin ETF filings could be approved by the SEC, according to Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas, including Grayscale’s conversion of its GBTC trust product. Grayscale has been in talks with the SEC over the conversion since winning its court battle with the SEC on August 29. In a new research note, James Seyffert predicts a 90% chance by January 10 of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval.\n\nETF Plays for Now\n\nDigital Assets\n\nBesides buying bitcoin yourself on an exchange like Coinbase, the easiest way to get direct bitcoin exposure is through futures-based ETF products like the Proshares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), which has attracted assets of more than $1.2 billion since its launch in October 2021. Since the launch of BITO, other bitcoin futures products have come to market, such as the VanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF (XBTF) and even a combo ETF strategy, the Valkyrie Bitcoin and Ether Strategy ETF (BTF), which holds both bitcoin and Ether futures.\n\nIn addition to bitcoin and Ethereum “pure plays”, there are multi-asset combinations such as the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK) and the Global X Blockchain & Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITS), which own both blockchain stocks and either non-US listed crypto ETFs and/or futures.\n\nBlockchain ETFs\n\nCrypto is an application on the blockchain, just like e-mail is an application on the Internet. There are many blockchain-focused ETFs as well. In addition to the actively managed BLOK, there is, in order of assets under management, the First Trust Indxx Innovative Transaction & Process ETF (LEGR), the Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators (BITQ), the Global X Blockchain ETF (BKCH), and the Siren NASDAQ Nex Gen Economy ETF (BLCN), to name a few.\n\nA reminder to new investors in the space: “Blockchain” was not allowed to be used in fund names due to SEC rules around naming conventions when many of these first ETF products launched during crypto’s last “spring phase” in early 2018.\n\nCrypto Mining ETFs\n\nMany of the blockchain-themed ETFs also own crypto mining stocks, but a purer play on that theme is the Invesco Alerian Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF (SATO) based on VettaFi’s CRYPTO Index or...'}]

The news articles suggest a positive outlook for the cryptocurrency market, particularly for Bitcoin and Ethereum. The potential approval of a spot bitcoin ETF by the SEC is anticipated to bring significant benefits for investors, leading to increased demand and potentially higher prices for Bitcoin. Additionally, the narrowing discounts on non-Bitcoin crypto trusts indicate growing investor confidence in the market, with expectations of further developments such as spot ETFs for other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. The launch of leveraged Bitcoin futures trading by CBOE in January 2024 also signals a maturing market and increased accessibility for traders.

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing fluctuations in key indicators such as unique addresses, total transactions, average fees, total value transferred, and MACD signals. This uncertainty is further supported by the news analyst report, which highlights mixed sentiments towards Bitcoin and its related companies, indicating potential challenges in the market.

In light of this information, it is evident that a slightly conservative approach focusing on long-term profitability and risk management is crucial in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. By considering the mixed sentiment in the news analyst report and closely monitoring key indicators, traders can make strategic decisions that prioritize long-term gains over short-term fluctuations.

Therefore, the clear market trend suggests that a slightly conservative trading approach is warranted to manage risk effectively and optimize profitability in the long run. While short-term gains may be possible, it is important to prioritize long-term strategies to navigate the uncertain market conditions successfully.

Based on this analysis, my trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.5, reflecting a cautious approach towards the current market trend and the need to manage risk appropriately for long-term profitability.

-0.5
DAILY RETURN:
-0.003978169930468511
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing volatility and indecision, as indicated by fluctuating trends in unique addresses, coinbase transactions, average fees, total size used, total value transferred, and MACD signals. This suggests that short-term trading strategies may be risky due to the uncertain market direction.

On the other hand, the news analyst report paints a positive outlook for Bitcoin, with a bullish sentiment driven by factors such as the potential approval of a Bitcoin ETF, the upcoming halving event, and perceived undervaluation. This indicates a favorable market trend for cryptocurrencies in general, including ETH.

In reflecting on the recent trading performance, it is evident that a slightly conservative approach focusing on long-term profitability and risk management has been effective in navigating the volatile ETH market. The importance of balancing risk and reward, prioritizing long-term gains over short-term fluctuations, and staying informed on market developments is emphasized.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is advisable to adopt a slightly conservative trading approach to manage risk effectively and optimize profitability in the long run. Therefore, I would recommend a trading action with a confidence level of 0.5, indicating a moderate level of confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to prioritize long-term gains over short-term fluctuations.

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing uncertainty and volatility. The fluctuating trends in unique addresses, total transactions, total value transferred, average fees, and MACD signals indicate indecision among traders and potential shifts in momentum. This suggests that caution is advised when making trading decisions in such a market environment.

The news analyst report further adds to the mixed outlook by highlighting contrasting developments in the cryptocurrency market. Positive news such as Bitcoin's mining revenue surge and the anticipation of a U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF approval could drive up demand and prices, while negative news like the hacking incident and the conviction of a prominent figure in the industry may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny and investor caution.

Reflecting on the reflection analyst report, it is evident that a slightly conservative approach focusing on long-term profitability and risk management has been effective in navigating the volatile ETH market. By closely monitoring key indicators and making strategic decisions, successful outcomes have been achieved. It is important to prioritize long-term gains over short-term fluctuations and continue to stay informed on market developments.

Considering the current market conditions of uncertainty and volatility, a slightly conservative trading approach is warranted to manage risk effectively and optimize profitability in the long run. Therefore, I would recommend a cautious approach with a focus on long-term strategies rather than short-term gains.

Based on the synthesized reports and the emphasis on long-term profitability and risk management, I would take a trading action with a confidence level of 0.3, indicating a moderate level of confidence in the market trend.

*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is experiencing fluctuations in various key indicators such as unique addresses, coinbase transactions, average fees, total size used, total value transferred, and MACD signals. This indicates a level of uncertainty and volatility in the market, making it challenging to predict a clear direction.

On the other hand, the news analyst report paints a more positive picture for the cryptocurrency market as a whole, with bullish trends expected due to potential developments such as the approval of a spot bitcoin ETF by the SEC and the launch of leveraged Bitcoin futures trading by CBOE. These factors suggest a growing investor confidence and potential for continued growth in the market.

In light of these reports, it is evident that a slightly conservative approach focusing on long-term profitability and risk management is advisable. By prioritizing long-term gains over short-term fluctuations and staying informed on market developments, traders can navigate the current uncertainty and volatility effectively.

Therefore, the clear market trend seems to be leaning towards a bullish outlook in the long term, despite the short-term fluctuations and uncertainties. It is crucial to remain cautious and prioritize long-term strategies to optimize profitability and manage risk effectively.

The company aims to seek shareholders' approval to authorize a $100 million acquisition mandate for purchasing Bitcoin, crypto, and stablecoins within a 12-month period.\n\nThe proposed mandate outlines the key parameters:\n\nMandate Period: The acquisition mandate spans 12 months post the ordinary resolution's approval at the Extraordinary General Meeting. Maximum Amount: An aggregate limit of $100 million has been set, with a specific focus on purchasing BTC, ETH, Tether USD (USDT), and USD Coin (USDC). Allocating $45 million each to acquiring BTC and ETH, with the remainder of no more than $10 million on USDT and USD Coin. Types of Cryptocurrencies: Boyaa says it is acquiring cryptocurrencies aligning with its business strategy, primarily BTC and ETH. Acquisition Consideration: Purchases will be based on open market bid and ask prices, with a maximum premium of 10% on the market price. The funding will derive from the Group's idle cash reserves. Authorization Scope: The Board will exercise discretion concerning transaction volume, timing, and cryptocurrency selection, conducting acquisitions on licensed trading platforms like HashKey Exchange.\n\nThe company anticipates dispatching a circular to shareholders by November 30, 2023, detailing the mandate's specifics and the proposed acquisitions.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."}, {'id': 29, 'time': 'Tue, 14 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Bitcoin Up Triple-Digits This Year: ETFs in Focus - Yahoo Finance', 'content': "The cryptocurrency market has experienced a resurgence in November. In the past one month (as of Nov 10, 2023), bitcoin price has surged 37.4%. This notable price increase has renewed interest and excitement in the crypto space after a period of relative stagnation.\n\nMarket analysts and experts are optimistic about the crypto market's outlook for the remaining two months of the year. This renewed bullish sentiment follows a robust recovery during the first seven months of the year, which had helped erase the disappointment of the previous year. Bitcoin is up 124% so far this year.\n\nFactors Behind the Rally\n\nSeveral key factors have contributed to the renewed rally in the cryptocurrency market:\n\nPause in Interest Rate Hikes: The Fed's decision to maintain its benchmark interest rates between 5.25% and 5.5% in both its September and November Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings has had a significant impact on crypto rally. Despite inflation levels exceeding the Fed's 2% target, recent labor market data suggesting a slowing job market has raised the possibility that the Federal Reserve may halt its ongoing monetary tightening campaign. This has instilled confidence in investors, particularly those in the cryptocurrency space, as higher interest rates typically have a dampening effect on growth sectors like technology, consumer discretionary, and cryptocurrency.\n\nPositive Impact on Cryptocurrency: The cryptocurrency market's response to the Federal Reserve's decision has been positive. The pause in interest rate hikes has created a favorable environment for cryptocurrencies to flourish, as it removes a potential hurdle to their growth. The rally is not limited to Bitcoin alone. Other major cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Binance Coin (BNB), have all experienced a resurgence in value during the same period. This broad market recovery underscores the strength of the current crypto rally.\n\nStory continues\n\nExpectations of SEC Okaying a Bitcoin ETF\n\nAnother significant driver of investor optimism is the expectation that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is close to approving a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). The approval of such an ETF would be a milestone for the cryptocurrency market, as it would provide traditional investors with a regulated and convenient avenue to invest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies through regular stock markets. This development is expected to increase demand for cryptocurrencies and attract new investments, potentially fueling further market growth.\n\nContinued Growth Expected\n\nGiven the current momentum and positive developments, the cryptocurrency market is poised for continued growth. Bitcoin's impressive performance, with its price more than doubling year-to-date, indicates that the ongoing rally is likely to persist, generating increased interest and enthusiasm among investors.\n\nETFs to Gain\n\nAgainst this backdrop, below-mentioned ETFs should be in focus for stellar gains.\n\nValkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF BTF – Up 109.9% Past Year; Up 39.6% Past Month\n\nValkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF is an actively managed ETF available through Nasdaq. It invests in bitcoin futures contracts and does not provide direct exposure to the price of bitcoin.

The fund charges 90 bps in fees.\n\nVanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF XBTF – Up 106.8% Past Year; Up 35.6% Past Month\n\nThe Vaneck Bitcoin Strategy ETF seeks capital appreciation by investing in bitcoin futures contracts. The fund charges 66 bps in fees.\n\nSimplify Bitcoin Strategy PLUS Income ETF MAXI – Up 103.3% Past Year; Up 35.8% Past Month\n\nThe Simplify Bitcoin Strategy PLUS Income ETF (MAXI) seeks capital gains and income by providing investors with exposure to bitcoin while simultaneously generating income by selling short-dated put or call spreads on the most liquid global equity indices.

ARK Invest Founder and CEO Cathie Wood says the partnership made sense given how complementary the firms\' areas of expertise are. Wood says that bitcoin (BTC-USD) is "the first global, digital, private rules based monetary system in history" adding that global monetary policy is "unhinged, it\'s not hinged to anything except human decision-making" and that "the monetary system is bitcoin."\n\nArk is one of the several firm trying to launch a spot bitcoin ETF. Wood says "something has changed," noting that the Securities and Exchange Commission has responded to their application with questions instead of just rejecting it. Wood believes this means that the odds of approval have gone up. Overall, Wood is still bull on bitcoin, saying her base case for the cryptocurrency is $600,000-$650,000. However, she thinks it could go higher, given the currency\'s scarcity and the potential for more institutional investment if a spot bitcoin ETF is approved.\n\nClick here to see the full interview with ARK Invest\'s Cathie Wood.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nJULIE HYMAN: One of the assets that perhaps surprisingly was not rising today was bitcoin, even though it has rallied as of late today, falling by some 3.4%. And it\'s on this day that Cathie Wood announced or ARK Invest announced in cooperation with 21shares. It\'s going to be launching a new suite of digital asset ETFs. They will be actively managed.\n\nAnd I had the chance to talk to her about digital assets, broadly about these products specifically, and, of course, about her still bullish stance on cryptocurrency.\n\nCATHIE WOOD: This is the first global, digital, private, rules-based monetary system in history. It\'s a very big idea. When we wrote the paper in collaboration with Art Laffer-- you know Art Laffer supply-side economics, Laffer curve-- he said, I\'ve been waiting for this since they closed the gold window in 1971. So he\'s been waiting 50 years for this, right? And he\'s so excited about everything crypto, but especially bitcoin, because he believes, and it is true, monetary policy around the world is unhinged. It\'s not hinged to anything except human decision making.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd this is going to put discipline, rigor back into--\n\nJULIE HYMAN: These particular products you\'re talking.\n\nCATHIE WOOD: Well, bitcoin is. The monetary system is bitcoin. And so, yes, the-- why now for these? We\'ve been working with 21shares since I met Ophelia at an ETF confab in 2018. They had really just started their business. And I said, you know, we want to move towards crypto. You are completely crypto. They were focused on the infrastructure, the regulations, really blazing a trail. They had to invent things in order to make this happen.\n\nAnd we knew that was not our core competency. And so we-- but we did start talking. Our core competency is research on disruptive innovation. And they do research. They do deep technical research on the market. Our research is on the disruptive innovation that it represents. And we\'ve just been coming together for five years. It was a natural for us to come together.\n\nThey are or 21shares is the largest crypto ETP provider in the world, $1.5 billion. They have 35 different funds. Most of them in Europe in and around Europe. They were looking for a US entry. And we were looking for infrastructure. And, you know, we\'re just delighted to be partnering with them given how much groundwork they had to lay for this to happen.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Speaking of groundwork, on another product that you\'re working on, of course, the spot bitcoin ETF, which you are also partnering with them on. And you\'ve got your filing in. There\'s a lot of filings in. Every day, seemingly, there is a new rumor about approval of one of these things. What are you hearing from the SEC at this point? Are-- you know, there\'s a January deadline I know that people have been looking to. How confident are you that you\'re going to get approval?\n\nCATHIE WOOD: Well, something has changed. So we had put in a number of times a filing. And we were just denied. Never got any questions really, never got any response. This time, this summer, we got questions back from the SEC. Now, normally, when you get questions from the SEC, you\'re just saying, oh, my goodness. We were thrilled to get questions back, because it means they\'re engaged now.\n\nNow, we have met a number of the research people at the SEC on the research side. And they are extremely sophisticated. They know what they\'re talking about. And the level of sophistication of their questions suggested, OK, now they\'re moving deeply into this. And we answered those questions. We have not heard back. That\'s a good sign, too. They never tell you that-- tell you that you\'ve satisfied them. But if you don\'t hear from them, they-- that usually means that you have satisfied the answers to the requests.\n\nSo that was new. And we also know that BlackRock got questions.

Do you think the Fed's done hiking rates? I do think the Fed is done hiking. And good morning to you guys. I think that the the inflation data was very positive and it's likely to go lower over the next quarter. And so Rick Rieder, a personal friend of mine, actually gave a presentation in Park City at Governor Romney's conference about a month ago and explained the the churning down of inflation. And I think that's very, very good for stock prices, very good for assets. But, of course, what do people want for Christmas in America? They want a low interest rate mortgage. And if you look at housing data in the United States right now, those markets are quite sluggish. I think the Fed is going to respond to that. You'll probably see cuts in interest rates before the end of the first quarter. And so that's very positive for asset prices across the board. Okay. You mentioned last time Bloomberg spoke with you about, you know, you had a great October for your fund. I think it's the best month you've had in the history of SkyBridge. A lot of it was crypto, which I'll get to later. But what what's the other part of that? I mean, is there any parts of that of your portfolio that really kind of benefit from maybe either higher for longer or a less sort of tightening environment? I guess who else, unfortunately, versus the bets that hurt us last year? We we left on for this year. And so unfortunately in investing, sometimes you can get the timing wrong. But we made the case in the fourth quarter of last year in the early part of 2023, that the Fed would start cutting rates more quickly, that inflation would come down more quickly once the supply chain had reconnected. And you saw all of this induction of new technology like A.I., robotic technology, etc., bringing down prices. And so we got the timing wrong. But if you're a long term investor, if you were patient with us, you did quite well. And and last year at this time here at this all conference, as I mentioned during the commercial break, I think Bitcoin was about 16 or 17,000. We have a 10% position in Bitcoin in our portfolio and of course that's gone up to 35, 36,000 in the last year. And I think that went up contrary to institutional sentiment at the time. Over the last year people were quite negative. I was in Davos, Switzerland, being interviewed by some of your colleagues. January of this year, everyone had written off Bitcoin. Of course, it went up about 115% since then. So it's a combination of a couple of different factors, but it's mostly about being bullish about the return of the global economy and global growth. post-COVID. It just took longer than people expected, but we're there now. Yeah, from 6000 to 35. Now, you mentioned 10% weighting. How are you managing your exposure to crypto? What do you suspect the changes will be over the next couple of months? Anthony? Well, I mean, I think one of the things we're very proud of is we're we were the first outside capital into the BlackRock Bitcoin Trust. And so as you guys know, they filed for a formal application with the SCC, the deadline for that application at least for the Ark application, Cathie Wood's is January 10th. It appears likely that these things will get approved if that happens. I think there's an induction of a tremendous amount of demand for Bitcoin and of course you have a happening in Bitcoin, which basically means the supply is going to get cut in half in April. So having lower supply, more demand, we think prices are going to trend higher for Bitcoin, Etherium and a few other currencies. And for those reasons we're going to stay long in the portfolio. And you know what? Well, you know, it's a concentrated bet for us, but we like it. It's a macro overlay. And I guess you guys will remember the beginning part of the year with the Silicon Valley bank crises. Bitcoin was quite resilient and it seems to also do what you'd want an alternative investment to do is go contra into carry indicatori to the overall market. And I think it's safe to say you're still deep into crypto. And of course, obviously your name was mentioned during those SBF trials. Well, I want to get your take on the verdict now that we have one here as well. And overall the future of FDX 2.0. Would you invest in it? Would I invest in it? Well, depends on who's running it. I think number one, I think if you read Michael Lewis's book, there was a business there. He had 12 and a half percent of the cryptocurrency market. So I think the sloppiness and the indiscretion and the eventual fraud obviously ruined the the business and ruin the reputation of that business. But there is a good. Underlying business of you. Tell me who's managing it. I would be open minded to that. But since you're mentioning FDA, I think it's important to point out to ..."}, {'id': 7, 'time': 'Tue, 14 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Cathie Wood on CPI Report, Fed Policy, Bitcoin ETFs - Bloomberg', 'content': "00:00\n\nKathy, obviously CPI, you saw it cool across the board in October, both on headline and on core. And to say the least, the market reaction has been pretty swift. Curious to hear your thoughts, though, when you think about what this means for the Fed. Is it safe to say that we've seen the last Fed rate hike of this cycle? Well, first of all, I'll say I agree with almost everything Ken Griffin just said except his comments about the Fed. For some time now, we've been saying that the Fed has overdone it and that the greater risk here is deflation. Yes, the CPI did not surprise us at all, although there were rumors that revisions would take it higher than many people thought. And so we believe we're beginning to see deflationary trends in many more sectors. Now, it started with commodities. Now we're seeing airline prices coming down, auto prices coming down, and we're seeing staples prices. They have been sticky. But what's happened to Staples volumes, they have gone down. That's not how you run Mac manufacturing plants. So we think that they will be forced into cutting prices as well. You heard Home Depot today, -3.8% comp store sales here in the United States. And if you look at the S & P 500, I think a third of all companies in the S & P 500 are reporting negative revenue growth. What we have characterized the last two years as a rolling recession, some measures of housing are down 40%. That's a recession. How? Autos, 15 million units in the US. That's kind of punk. It's recession like. And we're seeing these volume declines in staples. Right. You've got consumers pulling back. So I think the Fed's overdone it. I think we're going to see a lot more deflation going forward. We are going to hit that two handle and we will go below it and would not be surprised to see CPI inflation negative at some point next year. Well, Kathy, is that materializes? Let's talk about how the Fed responds, because as we've been talking about, you have seen traders really pull forward their pricing for rate cuts next year. Add to that, what do you think this translates to in terms of magnitude of rate cuts that the Fed will have to deliver? Well, if we're right and they've gone way too far, they'll have to cut fairly significantly. I tweeted, although I don't know if I use the word tweet anymore on x I, I put a chart which showed the ratio of metals prices to gold prices and charted it against long term interest rates. We've never seen this big of a gap. The the metals to gold price indicator is saying deflation is the risk. It's down near the low end of a range. And the the long term treasury yield is way, way above where it should be. In fact, this metric would suggest if you just eyeballed the chart and it's not perfect, 2% would be the right level of rates. So I actually said that in my last in the no YouTube video, you know, 2% rate. That was the reason. Just looking at price signals that the Fed does not seem to be paying attention to. I'm curious, Kathy, about that. I mean, based on that and I remember seeing that chart and I've looked at that same ratio, I mean, that would imply that basically where we're at right now, you know, in the mid to high fours, I'll close to the 5% that we need to get back down somewhere around 2% here. And I can't really see how that happens without either a significant economic downturn or just what would just be an unprecedented pivot by the Fed. I think that I think we're in a rolling recession and it will continue. I think consumers are basically saying no mas when it comes to pricing. We're seeing that in volume numbers. And so if companies can no longer get pricing, what's going to happen? Their margins, which have held up, are going to get crushed. And we do think that's the case. Now, they've held on to employees who were very difficult to get during the rebound from COVID, reluctant to let them go because it was such a struggle to bring them on. I think that's going to change. They're going to be responding to margin pressures. And we do think you're going to see more unemployment during during the next three, six, nine months in an election year. So it will really get a lot of attention. Well, I'm curious as to what this means for our financial markets. I mean, let's just kind of go with this, that this is the hypothetical that the Fed remains behind the curve. They don't react enough and the economic consequences are severe even if it's not a recession. But they are severe enough that it significantly limits consumer spending and for that matter, even business spending. How does that sort of factor in, I guess, to the growth story with a lot of the stocks that I think so many people have embraced this year based on this idea that there was a longer term structural story in a lot of those names. How does that change, if at all? Well, I mean, I don't know if you're referring to our ilk of stock, where we're very focused on innovation platforms that are evolving today. And they'r..."}]

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing volatility and indecision, as indicated by fluctuating trends in unique addresses, coinbase transactions, average fees, total size used, total value transferred, and MACD signals. This suggests that short-term trading strategies may be risky due to the uncertain market direction.

On the other hand, the news analyst report paints a positive outlook for Bitcoin, with a bullish sentiment driven by factors such as the potential approval of a Bitcoin ETF, the upcoming halving event, and perceived undervaluation. This indicates a favorable market trend for cryptocurrencies in general, including ETH.

In reflecting on the recent trading performance, it is evident that a slightly conservative approach focusing on long-term profitability and risk management has been effective in navigating the volatile ETH market. The importance of balancing risk and reward, prioritizing long-term gains over short-term fluctuations, and staying informed on market developments is emphasized.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is advisable to adopt a slightly conservative trading approach to manage risk effectively and optimize profitability in the long run. Therefore, I would recommend a trading action with a confidence level of 0.5, indicating a moderate level of confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to prioritize long-term gains over short-term fluctuations.
ACTION:
0.5
DAILY RETURN:
-0.0023880655556421937
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing uncertainty and volatility. The fluctuating trends in unique addresses, total transactions, total value transferred, average fees, and MACD signals indicate indecision among traders and potential shifts in momentum. This suggests that caution is advised when making trading decisions in such a market environment.

The news analyst report further adds to the mixed outlook by highlighting contrasting developments in the cryptocurrency market. Positive news such as Bitcoin's mining revenue surge and the anticipation of a U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF approval could drive up demand and prices, while negative news like the hacking incident and the conviction of a prominent figure in the industry may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny and investor caution.

Reflecting on the reflection analyst report, it is evident that a slightly conservative approach focusing on long-term profitability and risk management has been effective in navigating the volatile ETH market. By closely monitoring key indicators and making strategic decisions, successful outcomes have been achieved. It is important to prioritize long-term gains over short-term fluctuations and continue to stay informed on market developments.

Considering the current market conditions of uncertainty and volatility, a slightly conservative trading approach is warranted to manage risk effectively and optimize profitability in the long run. Therefore, I would recommend a cautious approach with a focus on long-term strategies rather than short-term gains.

Based on the synthesized reports and the emphasis on long-term profitability and risk management, I would take a trading action with a confidence level of 0.3, indicating a moderate level of confidence in the market trend.

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is experiencing fluctuations in various key indicators such as unique addresses, coinbase transactions, average fees, total size used, total value transferred, and MACD signals. This indicates a level of uncertainty and volatility in the market, making it challenging to predict a clear direction.

On the other hand, the news analyst report paints a more positive picture for the cryptocurrency market as a whole, with bullish trends expected due to potential developments such as the approval of a spot bitcoin ETF by the SEC and the launch of leveraged Bitcoin futures trading by CBOE. These factors suggest a growing investor confidence and potential for continued growth in the market.

In light of these reports, it is evident that a slightly conservative approach focusing on long-term profitability and risk management is advisable. By prioritizing long-term gains over short-term fluctuations and staying informed on market developments, traders can navigate the current uncertainty and volatility effectively.

Therefore, the clear market trend seems to be leaning towards a bullish outlook in the long term, despite the short-term fluctuations and uncertainties. It is crucial to remain cautious and prioritize long-term strategies to optimize profitability and manage risk effectively.

Based on this analysis, I would take a slightly conservative approach and assign a trading action of 0.5, reflecting moderate confidence in the bullish long-term trend while also acknowledging the short-term uncertainties in the market.

Bitcoin (BTCUSD) prices have more than doubled year-to-date, while Ethereum (ETHUSD) has surged close to 70% in 2023. Moreover, two key near-term drivers could drive cryptocurrency prices higher in the next 12 months.\n\nFirst is the Bitcoin halving event, which is expected to take place in April 2024. The total number of Bitcoin that can be mined is limited to 21 million, and the halving process reduces the rewards for mining - which is intended to control the supply of cryptocurrency on the market and limit inflation. The halving typically acts as a positive catalyst for Bitcoin. For instance, between November 2015 and November 2017, BTC prices surged by 2,000%, while they spiked almost 600% between November 2019 and November 2021.\n\nAnother significant event for cryptocurrencies could be the upcoming launch of multiple spot Bitcoin exchanged traded funds (ETFs). Several investment managers, including BlackRock (BLK) and Invesco (IVZ), have applied to introduce their own version of a spot Bitcoin ETF, which seems increasingly likely to be approved by the SEC in the next six months. BlackRock has close to $10 trillion in assets under management, and even if it allocates 1% of funds toward Bitcoin, it could result in inflows worth $100 billion.\n\nIt seems the time is ripe to invest in Bitcoin and related crypto assets right now. While you can purchase BTC and other cryptocurrencies directly from exchanges like Coinbase (COIN), another way to gain exposure to this area of the market is by investing in BTC mining companies. Here are three crypto stocks to consider buying before the 2024 Bitcoin halving event.\n\nTeraWulf Stock\n\nValued at $222 million by market cap, TeraWulf (WULF) develops, owns, and operates Bitcoin mining facility sites in New York and Pennsylvania. In Q3 of 2023, TeraWulf self-mined 611 BTC and realized another 13 BTC via hosting profit share. Its revenue rose to $19 million in Q3, up from $15.5 million in the year-ago period.\n\nThe total value of the self-mined Bitcoin stood at $27.9 million, while the power cost per Bitcoin rose 29% to $9,322 due to a 13% increase in network difficulty. TeraWulf reported adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) of $9 million, an increase of 19% year over year.\n\nOut of the five analysts tracking WULF, four recommend “strong buy,” and one recommends “moderate buy.” The average target price for WULF is $3.65, which is 244% above the current trading price.\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nHive Digital Technologies Stock\n\nHive Digital Technologies (HIVE) is another Bitcoin mining company, valued at $249 million by market cap. HIVE reported revenue of $22.8 million in Q3 and mined 801 BTC. Its gross operating profit stood at $4.6 million, indicating a margin of 20%.\n\nThe number of BTC mined during the quarter fell by 6.6% year over year. Similar to TeraWulf, HIVE's revenue was impacted by increased mining network difficulty, which means more miners were competing with better equipment for the opportunity to mine the maximum number of Bitcoin. HIVE recently purchased 4,800 Bitmain S19k Pro ASIC miners, allowing it to upgrade a portion of its fleet to improve mining efficiency.\n\nOut of the three analysts tracking HIVE, two recommend “strong buy,” and one recommends “moderate buy.” The average target price for HIVE is $6.83, which is 127% above the current trading price.\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nRiot Blockchain Stock\n\nThe final Bitcoin mining stock on my list is Riot Blockchain (RIOT), valued at $2 billion by market cap. Among the largest BTC mining companies in the world, Riot reported revenue of $51.9 million in Q3, as it mined 1,106 Bitcoin during the quarter.\n\nThe company has mined a total of 4,996 BTC in 2023 with an average cost of just $5,537 per Bitcoin, which indicates Riot is a leading low-cost producer of the digital asset. Riot ended Q3 with $290 million in cash and 7,327 BTC worth $500 million, providing it with the liquidity to ride out an uncertain macro environment.\n\nOut of the eight analysts tracking RIOT, six recommend “strong buy,” one recommends “moderate buy,” and one recommends “strong sell.” The average target price for RIOT is $16.78, which is 65% above the current trading price.\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nOn the date of publication, Aditya Raghunath did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

While there is optimism surrounding the potential approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs and the upcoming Bitcoin halving event in 2024, there are also concerns about the negative correlation between Bitcoin and global stocks, as well as the SEC's deferral of decisions on Bitcoin-related filings. ARK Invest's Cathie Wood remains bullish on Bitcoin, predicting a potential rise to $1.5 million per coin by 2030. Overall, the market trend for ETH and BTC appears to be influenced by regulatory decisions, institutional adoption, and macroeconomic factors, with potential for growth but also risks associated with market volatility and regulatory uncertainty.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing uncertainty and volatility. The fluctuating trends in unique addresses, total transactions, total value transferred, average fees, and MACD signals indicate indecision among traders and potential shifts in momentum. This suggests that caution is advised when making trading decisions in such a market environment.

The news analyst report further adds to the mixed outlook by highlighting contrasting developments in the cryptocurrency market. Positive news such as Bitcoin's mining revenue surge and the anticipation of a U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF approval could drive up demand and prices, while negative news like the hacking incident and the conviction of a prominent figure in the industry may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny and investor caution.

Reflecting on the reflection analyst report, it is evident that a slightly conservative approach focusing on long-term profitability and risk management has been effective in navigating the volatile ETH market. By closely monitoring key indicators and making strategic decisions, successful outcomes have been achieved. It is important to prioritize long-term gains over short-term fluctuations and continue to stay informed on market developments.

Considering the current market conditions of uncertainty and volatility, a slightly conservative trading approach is warranted to manage risk effectively and optimize profitability in the long run. Therefore, I would recommend a cautious approach with a focus on long-term strategies rather than short-term gains.

Based on the synthesized reports and the emphasis on long-term profitability and risk management, I would take a trading action with a confidence level of 0.3, indicating a moderate level of confidence in the market trend.

DAILY RETURN:

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is experiencing fluctuations in various key indicators such as unique addresses, coinbase transactions, average fees, total size used, total value transferred, and MACD signals. This indicates a level of uncertainty and volatility in the market, making it challenging to predict a clear direction.

On the other hand, the news analyst report paints a more positive picture for the cryptocurrency market as a whole, with bullish trends expected due to potential developments such as the approval of a spot bitcoin ETF by the SEC and the launch of leveraged Bitcoin futures trading by CBOE. These factors suggest a growing investor confidence and potential for continued growth in the market.

In light of these reports, it is evident that a slightly conservative approach focusing on long-term profitability and risk management is advisable. By prioritizing long-term gains over short-term fluctuations and staying informed on market developments, traders can navigate the current uncertainty and volatility effectively.

Therefore, the clear market trend seems to be leaning towards a bullish outlook in the long term, despite the short-term fluctuations and uncertainties. It is crucial to remain cautious and prioritize long-term strategies to optimize profitability and manage risk effectively.

Based on this analysis, I would take a slightly conservative approach and assign a trading action of 0.5, reflecting moderate confidence in the bullish long-term trend while also acknowledging the short-term uncertainties in the market.

In an interview with Bloomberg, Paolo Ardoino, the expected CEO of Tether, shared the company\'s intentions to construct mining facilities and invest in other miners. The focus of this expansion will be on establishing mining sites in Uruguay, Paraguay, and El Salvador, with the goal of increasing Tether\'s computing power to represent 1% of the BTC mining network. These new facilities will have a capacity ranging from 40 to 70 megawatts.\n\nThis mining investment is part of Tether\'s recent $610 million debt financing facility, which was extended to German miner Northern Data Group.

The company is also considering the establishment of a 300-megawatt facility and plans to set up its mining infrastructure inside containers that can be relocated based on fluctuations in electricity prices.

It\'s "no different than gold" as the yellow metal\'s value stems from centuries of people believing it\'s worth something, he said.\n\n"Bitcoin is the same thing – but for a new generation," he wrote, noting there\'s conviction in the digital token\'s value but unlike gold, it\'s completely decentralized.

Is it going to be an important milestone? Great to be here, Matt. Thanks very much for having me. And I think you just hit that. That is the key question is is not so much the data, it's not so much when exactly the ETFs will launch, it's what will the impact be. And I think that you you really touched on it right at the top of the show with the correlation chart because that is really the key. That is the key reason for allocation to Bitcoin. I think for most investors it is that mark of vit C and free lunch that bitcoin provides because of its diversification effects, because it has over the long run been uncorrelated to most of the major asset classes. Very low correlation exhibited over the past ten years. There have been periods where that correlation has gone up, as you rightly mentioned, in that pandemic era. But this year, for most of this year, the correlation has indeed been negative if there has been any correlation at all. So that diversification re effects that that it can give in view to portfolios of stocks, bonds, cash and alternatives is what's going to drive the conversation. That's what's going to drive the inflows. The question is what is that allocation? Because because the quantitative evidence, the empirical evidence tells us it shouldn't be zero. It shouldn't be zero. But I've heard often in Conversation Suey about this idea that really at this point, you shouldn't be putting anything into crypto that you're not willing to use, and that would maybe suggest that it shouldn't be super heavily weighted in a portfolio in terms of that asset allocation break up It also, we have to keep in mind it comes against a backdrop of there being a lot of anticipation to your point about a spot ETF being approved eventually. Maybe it's a question of when, not a question of if. And I just wonder how much of that anticipation already is baked into what we're seeing in prices and if ultimately what we see is, okay, maybe a little bit more institutional attraction, a little bit more volume in terms of flows, but pricing doesn't change that much. What do you think? Yeah, that's a that's a that's a really interesting question. And I think it it you know, people have been talking about, oh, it's baked into the price that authorization approval is baked into the price. And indeed the approval may be baked into the price. But as you rightly point out, it's not so much the approval, it's how much in flow are these products, If they are approved, when they are approved, how much inflow will they see? That's you know, what is the market pricing in? Is the market pricing in the $5 billion of inflow or is it pricing in $10 billion of inflow? We don't really know. And so I think that most investors will will look at this cautiously. I don't think any institutional investors are going to be thinking about timing, the market timing of bump. What most institutional investors will be looking at is over the long term and the diversification effects that Bitcoin can have in their portfolios and add more resilience to the returns that they will see from their portfolios."}]

The news analyst report, on the other hand, suggests a positive sentiment towards the cryptocurrency market, driven by factors such as ETF hopes and endorsements from influential figures, which could potentially lead to an upward trend in ETH prices. The reflection analyst report emphasizes a slightly conservative approach focusing on long-term profitability and risk management, given the current mixed signals and uncertainties in the market.

Synthesizing these reports, it is evident that while there are positive sentiments and potential for price appreciation in the short term, the overall market trend remains uncertain. Therefore, a slightly conservative trading approach focusing on long-term profitability and risk management is recommended. It is important to closely monitor key indicators and market developments to make informed decisions.

Considering the mixed signals and uncertainties in the market, I would take a slightly conservative approach and assign a trading action of 0.3, reflecting moderate confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately for long-term profitability.

Last week, Ether, the second-most-popular digital currency, surged 10 percent to around $2,100, its best performance in months. Some investors rushed to declare the end of the so-called crypto winter of falling prices and financial scandals that have plagued the industry for the last 18 months.\n\nDriving the renewed euphoria? A potential new fund.\n\nCrypto investors are growing optimistic that the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve an exchange-traded fund, or E.T.F., that tracks the price of Bitcoin, analysts said. The fund would trade on traditional stock exchanges and offer an easy way for people to invest in cryptocurrencies, potentially bringing a wave of money into the industry.\n\nSome proponents have hailed the possibility of this new investment vehicle, known as a spot Bitcoin E.T.F., as crypto’s “salvation.” In August, Grayscale Investments, a crypto asset manager, scored a legal victory over the S.E.C. that seemed to pave the way for it to offer the Bitcoin product. And last week, BlackRock, a giant money manager, filed paperwork to establish a similar E.T.F. to track the price of Ether.'}, {'id': 15, 'time': 'Fri, 17 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Report Scammed Bitcoin Expands Services to Aid Crypto Trading Victims in Recovering Lost Assets - Yahoo Finance', 'content': "New York, NY, United States --News Direct-- King Newswire\n\nReport Scammed Bitcoin, a crypto recovery services provider, has announced the extension of its services by assisting individuals who have fallen victim to unethical practices in crypto trading.

Here's what crypto investors need to know - CNBC", 'content': 'After a more than 80% jump in bitcoin\'s price in the first half of 2023, crypto market watchers gave CNBC their expectations for how the cryptocurrency will perform in the latter half of the year. STR | NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nAs investors weigh year-end tax moves, there may be a lesser-known savings opportunity for certain cryptocurrency investors, experts say. After the crypto industry lost nearly $1.4 trillion in 2022, many investors leveraged tax loss harvesting, which uses losses to offset profits. But after a rally in 2023, you may consider strategically selling profitable crypto held in brokerage accounts, known as "tax gain harvesting." The strategy works for investors in the 0% long-term capital gains bracket who have owned digital assets for more than one year, according to certified public accountant Tom Wheelwright, CEO of WealthAbility.\n\nLoading chart...\n\nAs of November 17, the price of bitcoin has more than doubled since the beginning of 2023, and some investors now have "built-in gains," Wheelwright said. Those in the 0% long-term capital gains bracket can "sell it, recognize the gain and buy it back immediately" because there\'s no so-called wash sale rule for gains, he said. You calculate gains by subtracting the asset\'s sales price from the "basis" or original cost. But when you repurchase the currency, the basis adjusts to the new purchase price, known as a "step-up in basis." If prices continue to climb and you sell the asset again later, the higher basis means future profits will be smaller. Investors "really ought to be paying attention" to tax-free opportunities to harvest crypto gains, according to Wheelwright. Of course, the decision to repurchase crypto depends on your risk tolerance and goals.\n\nWhy it\'s a \'wiser strategy\' to harvest gains\n\nIf you fall into the 0% bracket, crypto tax-gain harvesting is a "wiser strategy" than harvesting losses, especially when immediately buying back the asset, explained Andrew Gordon, tax attorney, CPA and president of Gordon Law Group. Tax-loss harvesting has been popular among crypto investors because of a wash sale loophole. The IRS disallows a loss for other assets if investors buy a "substantially identical" asset within the 30-day window before or after the sale. The wash sale rule doesn\'t apply to crypto losses or gains for any asset. Still, the tax gain strategy allows you to sell at a gain and pay no tax, whereas "tax loss harvesting defers future tax," Gordon said.\n\nwatch now\n\nHow to know your capital gains bracket\n\nFor 2023, you may fall into the 0% long-term capital gains rate with taxable income of $44,625 or less for single filers and $89,250 or less for married couples filing jointly. That\'s based on "taxable income," which is significantly lower than gross earnings. You calculate taxable income by subtracting the greater of the standard or itemized deductions from your adjusted gross income.'}, {'id': 27, 'time': 'Fri, 17 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Sora Summit 2023: Unveiling the Future of Bitcoin in Taipei - Nasdaq', 'content': "In a dynamic intersection of technology, finance, and innovation, Sora Summit 2023 is set to unfold on December 16 at the Songshan Cultural and Creative Park in Taipei. This eagerly anticipated event, organized by Sora Ventures, a digital asset venture capital firm, promises to be the pinnacle of Taipei Blockchain Week.\n\nA Legacy of Collaboration and Excellence\n\nSora Summit made its debut in 2018 in Macau, attracting over 1,000 participants and featuring more than 100 speakers from globally recognized entities such as Pantera Capital and Binance Labs. The summit has since evolved into a benchmark for quality information, distinguished speakers, and high-profile attendees, setting the stage for collaborative efforts within the Bitcoin community.\n\n“The development of bitcoin utility will be far more relevant tobitcoin pricethan anyone can imagine. Historically, utility has been the core factor to price increase on any blockchain,” said Jason Fang, Managing Partner and Co-Founder at Sora Ventures. “Sora’s investment team feels very strongly about this trend and we are eager to share our knowledge and resources through Sora Summit.”\n\nFour Pillars of Focus\n\nThis year, Sora Summit returns with a renewed commitment to fostering collaboration and exploring the latest trends in the Bitcoin space. The event will revolve around four key sectors, each crucial to the evolution of Bitcoin and digital assets:\n\nBitcoin Ecosystem: Delving into the recent surge in Bitcoin's utility and value, the summit aims to unravel the intricacies of the Bitcoin ecosystem with insights from industry leaders.\n\nDecentralized Science: As the future of open-sourced scientific research takes center stage, the summit will facilitate discussions on the transformative potential of decentralized science.\n\nCryptography & Encryption: Tackling the pressing challenges of data privacy, experts will converge to propose innovative solutions within the realm of cryptography and encryption.\n\nOrdinals: Exploring the next phase for greater adoption, Sora Summit will shed light on the evolving landscape of Ordinals, Inscriptions and their expanding utilities and use cases.\n\nDistinguished Speakers Shaping the Dialogue\n\nThis year's summit boasts an impressive lineup of speakers representing prominent organizations within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Notable figures include Casey Rodarmor, the Creator of the Ordinals Protocol, Danny Yang, CEO at Metagood and OnChainMonkey, David Bailey, CEO at Bitcoin Magazine, and Domo, the Creator of BRC-20 standard and the token ORDI. These speakers bring a wealth of experience and expertise, ensuring diverse perspectives on the critical issues facing the Bitcoin industry today.\n\nTaipei: A Pivotal Hub for Blockchain Innovation\n\nFang highlighted the significance of choosing Taipei as the host city. He emphasized Taipei's unique position in bridging the East and West in the Bitcoin landscape, citing the city's immense potential to contribute to the industry ecosystem. “A lot of people in our industry have heard about Ordinals and decentralized science, but not many people actually understand what the technology does,” explained Fang. “This is why we’re hosting Sora Summit, so we can fill the knowledge gap for those who are keen to hear about the future narratives in Bitcoin.” By partnering with Taipei Blockchain Week, Sora Summit aims to underscore Taipei's importance within the global blockchain community, providing an unparalleled platform for participants to learn, network, and collaborate.\n\nA Confluence of Minds and Technologies\n\nAs Sora Summit 2023 prepares to unfold in Taipei, the anticipation is palpable. With a focus on the Bitcoin ecosystem and a diverse array of sectors critical to the future of digital commerce, the summit promises to be a melting pot of ideas, collaboration, and innovation. The distinguished speakers will undoubtedly play a pivotal role in shaping the discourse and steering the Bitcoin industry toward new horizons.

When a bitcoin is successfully mined, the miner receives a predetermined amount of bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin is a cryptocurrency that’s gained a wide following due to its wild price swings and surging value since it was first created in 2009.\n\nAs prices of cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin in particular have skyrocketed in recent years, it’s understandable that interest in mining has picked up as well. But for most people, the prospects for Bitcoin mining are not good due to its complex nature and high costs. Here are the basics on how Bitcoin mining works and some key risks to be aware of.\n\nBitcoin mining statistics\n\nDollar Coin\n\nA miner currently earns 6.25 Bitcoin (about $227,500 as of November 2023) for successfully validating a new block on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nCreating Bitcoin consumes 147 terawatt-hours of electricity each year, more than is used by the Netherlands or the Philippines, according to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index.\n\nIt would take nine years of household-equivalent electricity to mine a single bitcoin as of August 2021.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin has been extremely volatile over time. In 2020, it traded as low as $4,107 and reached an all-time high of $68,790 in November 2021. As of November 2023, it traded for about $36,400.\n\nWhile it depends on your computing power and that of other miners, the odds of a modestly powered solo miner solving a Bitcoin hash were about 1 in 26.9 million in January 2023.\n\nThe United States (37.4 percent), Mainland China (18.1 percent) and Kazakhstan (14.0 percent) were the largest bitcoin miners as of January 2022, according to the Cambridge Electricity Consumption Index.\n\nUnderstanding Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin is one of the most popular types of cryptocurrencies, which are digital mediums of exchange that exist solely online. Bitcoin runs on a decentralized computer network or distributed ledger that tracks transactions in the cryptocurrency. When computers on the network verify and process transactions, new bitcoins are created, or mined. These networked computers, or miners, process the transaction in exchange for a payment in Bitcoin.\n\nStory continues\n\nBitcoin is powered by blockchain, which is the technology that powers many cryptocurrencies. A blockchain is a decentralized ledger of all the transactions across a network. Groups of approved transactions together form a block and are joined to create a chain. Think of it as a long public record that functions almost like a long running receipt. Bitcoin mining is the process of adding a block to the chain.\n\nHow Bitcoin mining works\n\nIn order to successfully add a block, Bitcoin miners compete to solve extremely complex math problems that require the use of expensive computers and enormous amounts of electricity. To complete the mining process, miners must be first to arrive at the correct or closest answer to the question. The process of guessing the correct number (hash) is known as proof of work. Miners guess the target hash by randomly making as many guesses as quickly as they can, which requires major computing power. The difficulty only increases as more miners join the network.\n\nThe computer hardware required is known as application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, and can cost up to $10,000. ASICs consume huge amounts of electricity, which has drawn criticism from environmental groups and limits the profitability of miners.\n\nIf a miner is able to successfully add a block to the blockchain, they will receive 6.25 bitcoins as a reward. The reward amount is cut in half roughly every four years, or every 210,000 blocks. As of November 2023, Bitcoin traded at around $36,400, making 6.25 bitcoins worth $227,500.\n\nIs Bitcoin mining profitable?\n\nIt depends. Even if Bitcoin miners are successful, it’s not clear that their efforts will end up being profitable due to the high upfront costs of equipment and the ongoing electricity costs. The electricity for one ASIC can use the same amount of electricity as half a million PlayStation 3 devices, according to a 2019 report from the Congressional Research Service.\n\nAs the difficulty and complexity of Bitcoin mining has increased, the computing power required has also gone up. Bitcoin mining consumes about 147 terawatt-hours of electricity each year, more than most countries, according to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index. You’d need 9 years’ worth of the typical U.S. household’s electricity to mine just one bitcoin as of August 2021.\n\nSource: Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index\n\nOne way to share some of the high costs of mining is by joining a mining pool. Pools allow miners to share resources and add more capability, but shared resources mean shared rewards, so the potential payout is less when working through a pool. The volatility of Bitcoin’s price also makes it difficult to know e...'}]

Bitcoin was trading near $40,000 at the time. It’s now trading at around $36,288.\n\nMeanwhile, Berkshire Hathaway’s Class A stock has outperformed the cryptocurrency and recently reached an all-time high, surpassing $560,000. Presently, the Class A stock sits above $545,000.\n\nDon\'t miss\n\nCommercial real estate has outperformed the S&P 500 over 25 years. Here\'s how to diversify your portfolio without the headache of being a landlord\n\nRising prices are throwing off Americans\' retirement plans — here\'s how to get your savings back on track\n\n\'A natural way to diversify\': Janet Yellen now says Americans should expect a decline in the USD as the world\'s reserve currency — 3 ways you can prepare\n\nUnsurprisingly, Buffett hasn’t changed his mind about the world’s most persistent digital obsession. “I’ve seen people do stupid things all my life,” Buffett said in an interview with CNBC earlier this year, comparing betting on Bitcoin to playing the slots in Las Vegas.\n\n“We’ve had an explosion of gambling, essentially. And I like to bet on a football game — if I’m sitting and watching, it makes it more interesting. But I don’t think I want to make a living trying to bet against the house.”\n\nInstead of crypto, Buffett has been laser-focused on his preferred asset class: equities. Here are the top three stocks he’s invested in over the past year that have outperformed Bitcoin by a wide margin.\n\nLennar Corp.\n\nBuffett seems to be focused on American homebuilders right now. He added a stake in Lennar Corporation (LEN) sometime in the second quarter of 2023, according to recent regulatory filings.\n\nThe Florida-based company is one of the largest home builders in the country. That puts it in a favorable position given the shortage of homes across America. Between 2012 and 2022, there were 6.5 million more households formed than homes constructed. If this gap continues to widen, demand for homebuilding could skyrocket.\n\nStory continues\n\nBuffett seems to be betting on this trend, adding two other homebuilders, NVR (NVR) and DR Horton (DHI), to his portfolio during the second quarter.\n\nRead more: Rich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market — and are betting on these 3 assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwinds\n\nDiageo\n\nIn the first quarter of the year, Buffett added a stake in British alcoholic beverage giant Diageo (DEO). But the Oracle of Omaha is no stranger to sin stocks, having acquired a sizable stake in Guinness, the beer brand that would eventually be combined with other brands to form Diageo, back in the 1990s.\n\nAt the time, Buffett even compared the investment to his most famous bet. “In the sense of where they earn their profits — continent-by-continent — Coca-Cola and Guinness display strong similarities," he wrote in a letter to investors that year.\n\nNow, Diageo is back in the Berkshire portfolio, and that’s probably a sign that the company is undervalued. The stock trades at just under 19 times earnings per share and offers a 2.57% dividend yield. Meanwhile, Bitcoin\'s dividend yield is 0% and has a non-existent price-to-earnings ratio.\n\nOccidental Petroleum\n\nWarren Buffett is clearly bullish on energy, at least in the medium term. That’s why he started accumulating a stake in Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY) last year and now controls over 25% of the company’s outstanding shares.\n\nThe price of crude oil has rebounded in recent months. In fact, it hit a 10-month high recently and experts expect demand to keep a price floor on the commodity for the year ahead. That’s a major tailwind for oil producers like Occidental.\n\nBuffett’s bet on energy giants is now a key part of his portfolio. Considering how cheap these companies are (Occidental stock trades at 11 times earnings), retail investors should consider taking a closer look too.\n\nWhat to read next\n\nThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

Warren Buffett's negative stance on Bitcoin as "rat poison squared" has not deterred him from investing in other asset classes, such as equities. His investments in homebuilders like Lennar Corp., alcoholic beverage giant Diageo, and energy company Occidental Petroleum indicate a bullish outlook on these sectors. This shift away from cryptocurrency towards traditional assets suggests a potential trend towards more stable and established investment opportunities in the market.

The recent eight-day window for potential approvals has concluded without any new ETFs being launched, prompting the SEC to announce a review of the applications in the coming year.\n\nThe SEC has postponed approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF from Global X and Franklin Templeton, as well as an application from Hashdex earlier this week. These delays have become a recurring theme as the SEC remains cautious about approving Bitcoin ETFs due to concerns surrounding market manipulation.\n\nAnticipation for the potential approval of a Bitcoin ETF has long been held by market observers who believe it could result in a substantial influx of capital from Wall Street into the cryptocurrency market. Analysts at CryptoQuant suggest that such approval could provide a $1 trillion boost to Bitcoin and other digital assets.\n\nDespite the delays, analysts from Bloomberg Intelligence now estimate a 90% likelihood of a Bitcoin ETF receiving approval by January. Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has expressed its preparedness to swiftly respond if a spot Bitcoin ETF is approved, anticipating enhanced market stability and liquidity, similar to what has been witnessed with other asset classes like gold ETFs.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form.'}, {'id': 6, 'time': 'Sun, 19 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'With spot bitcoin ETFs looming, clock ticks on futures products - Financial Times', 'content': 'Print this page\n\nTwo years ago the first US exchange traded fund linked to bitcoin became the fastest ETF to hit $1bn in assets. But the coming weeks are set to test whether it and rival bitcoin futures ETFs can survive.\n\nThe ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) now stands at $1.4bn, and it tracks the crypto token through futures. This type of product has been the only way for US investors to add bitcoin ETFs to their portfolios, as regulators have not approved numerous applications to launch ETFs tracking the crypto token itself.\n\nBut the Securities and Exchange Commission now faces a January 10 deadline to approve one or more pending applications for “spot bitcoin” ETFs, which are expected to provide a cheaper way for investors to gain bitcoin exposure.\n\n“I don’t think there’s much life for that product after spot bitcoin launches,” said Will Peck, head of digital assets at WisdomTree, which has filed to launch a spot bitcoin ETF. Peck acknowledged that bitcoin futures ETFs could retain some short-term trading utility but “if you’re a financial adviser or long-term investor, I don’t see why you’d have it”.\n\nThis summer brought a flurry of fresh applications for spot bitcoin ETFs in a rush prompted by BlackRock and a legal blow for the SEC after a federal appeals court ruled against the regulator in a bitcoin ETF-related lawsuit in August.\n\nUS regulators continue to hold doubts around whether spot bitcoin ETFs would be appropriate for investors, in part because of the heightened risk that the price of these often illiquid tokens is vulnerable to manipulation. Big trading platforms in this space are subject to a range of regulatory investigations and one of the biggest, FTX, imploded a year ago leading its chief executive Sam Bankman-Fried to be found guilty on multiple fraud and money laundering charges this month. However, industry insider still believe regulators will approve spot bitcoin ETFs in early 2024.\n\nIf that happens, some think the futures ETFs and spot ETFs can coexist.\n\n“I think savvy investors who are risk-averse will gravitate to a product like BITO,” said ProShares chief executive Michael Sapir, whose firm has not filed for a spot product. Oversight of the futures market by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and fund administration services provided by a known financial juggernaut both offer support to the model he espouses.\n\n“There is risk in investing directly in the spot market [as opposed to BITOs] regulated futures contracts being held by JPMorgan,” he said.\n\nPeck also pointed out that bitcoin itself is already obtainable by anyone with investable assets and the technical skill to set up a digital wallet. This should temper expectations for “some giant organic demand right out of the gate” for spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\n“I view the [spot bitcoin] ETF as a workflow solution for primarily the wealth management channel,” Peck said.\n\nCathie Wood’s Ark Investment Management and Swiss crypto manager 21Shares, which are among the firms hoping to launch a spot bitcoin product, earlier this month launched a suite of five digital asset ETFs, including a bitcoin futures strategy, which also indicates that futures ETFs will still have a role. Those two firms’ spot bitcoin ETF application is set for its final deadline on January 10 after repeated delays on a decision by the SEC.\n\nThe potential for a dozen of spot bitcoin ETFs raises the prospect of fierce struggles to differentiate an ETF’s brand, distribution tactics or price. In addition to 10 asset managers filing to launch spot bitcoin ETFs from scratch, Grayscale wants to reinvent the $23.3bn Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) as an ETF — the SEC’s initial refusal to allow this manoeuvre triggered Grayscale’s lawsuit — while Brazilian asset manager Hashdex is trying to convert its existing bitcoin futures ETF into a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nBlackRock, Ark Investment Management, Fidelity and Invesco are among the issuers waiting to hear from the SEC on their prospective spot ETFs, which trade over exchanges like stocks and enjoy favourable tax treatment. Spot bitcoin ETFs would not incur charges that futures-based products must bear, such as the cost of rolling over contracts on a regular basis, so they are expected to be substantially less expensive than both BITO and GBTC, which charge fees of 0.95 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively.\n\nBecause the pending products are so similar and may launch all at once, their fees are likely to be a key differentiator compared to a typical ETF launch, which could drive down costs to investors, said Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research for North America at Morningstar. He noted that providers are likely to fight for investors with low fees because “this is such a huge opportunity”.'}]

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
The news articles highlight the ongoing delays in approving spot Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC, with analysts predicting a high likelihood of approval by January 2024. The potential approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs is expected to bring a significant influx of capital into the cryptocurrency market, potentially boosting Bitcoin and other digital assets by $1 trillion. While existing Bitcoin futures ETFs like BITO may face challenges once spot Bitcoin ETFs are approved, there is belief that both types of ETFs can coexist. The market trend is likely to see increased interest and investment in Bitcoin and other digital assets once spot Bitcoin ETFs are approved, potentially leading to a surge in market activity and prices.

After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is experiencing fluctuations in price and transaction metrics, with uncertain trends indicated by the MACD signals and varying levels of user activity.

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently exhibiting mixed signals with fluctuating indicators such as unique addresses, coinbase transactions, average fees, and MACD signals. This uncertainty is further emphasized by the news analyst report, which highlights positive developments in the cryptocurrency market but also acknowledges the potential for growth and increased interest.

In light of these reports, it is evident that a slightly conservative approach, as mentioned in the reflection analyst report, focusing on long-term profitability and risk management is the most prudent strategy. The market trend appears uncertain with potential for both bullish and bearish movements, making it crucial to closely monitor key indicators and stay informed on market developments.

Considering the mixed signals and uncertain market trend, I would recommend a cautious approach with a focus on long-term gains rather than short-term gains. It is important to prioritize risk management and strategic decision-making to optimize profitability in the long run.

Therefore, my trading action would be to buy ETH with a confidence level of 0.3, reflecting a moderate level of confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately. This decision aligns with the recommendation for a slightly conservative approach to trading in the current market environment.

The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a slightly conservative approach focusing on long-term profitability and risk management in navigating the volatile market.

Therefore, a long-term strategy focusing on risk management and strategic decision-making is recommended to optimize profitability in the current market environment.

The news articles highlight the ongoing delays in approving spot Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC, with analysts predicting a high likelihood of approval by January 2024. The potential approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs is expected to bring a significant influx of capital into the cryptocurrency market, potentially boosting Bitcoin and other digital assets by $1 trillion. While existing Bitcoin futures ETFs like BITO may face challenges once spot Bitcoin ETFs are approved, there is belief that both types of ETFs can coexist.

On November 20, Bitcoin's average daily transaction fee reached $10.34, while Ethereum's average fee stood at $8.43.\n\nThe upswing in Bitcoin transaction fees is a result of heightened activity surrounding the Ordinals Protocol, which enables the creation of NFT-like assets and BRC-20 tokens on the Bitcoin network. After a period of relative dormancy in late September to October, Ordinals-based assets experienced a significant surge in late October, according to Dune Analytics.\n\nSince October 24, over 6 million Ordinal assets have been generated, leading to the redistribution of more than 800 BTC in fees (equivalent to $30 million) to the network. The momentum further escalated when ORDI, the second-largest BRC-20 token by market capitalization, was listed on Binance on November 7. This listing sparked increased buying activity of BRC-20 tokens, resulting in a price surge of slightly over 50% for the ORDI token.\n\nIn addition to the growing popularity of the Ordinals Protocol, the Taproot Wizards project, which is built on the Ordinals protocol, announced a seed funding round of $7.5 million on November 17.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."}, {'id': 25, 'time': 'Mon, 20 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT', 'title': "3 Reasons Bitcoin's Momentum is just Beginning - Yahoo Finance", 'content': 'Whether it be a game of pool, a “2-minute drill” for a football team, or the stock market, momentum can play an integral role in technical and fundamental outcomes. On Wall Street, one can trace the heart of price trends to fundamental momentum. For stocks, this usually means increasing earnings expectations, leading to more investor interest. For other assets, it can mean scarcity and a better use case. Either way, all price trends are birthed when buying pressure outweighs selling pressure and momentum picks up. Bitcoin, which is up ~125% year-to-date and is the world’s most popular cryptocurrency, is one such asset class gaining momentum. Below are three reasons the Bitcoin momentum may just be beginning:\n\nInternational Adoption & Real-World Use is on the Rise\n\nLast night, hyperinflation-plagued Argentina shocked the world by electing a wild-haired, chainsaw-wielding Libertarian candidate named Javier Milei. After embracing socialism for years, an inflation rate of more than 100% a year pushed citizens of South America’s second-largest economy to move in a completely different direction and try something new politically. Years of money printing, currency devaluation, and corruption have collectively brought the country to a tipping point, disrupting the delicate balance between money supply and economic output. Investors cheered the news and sent domestic juggernauts like oil juggernaut YPF (YPF) higher by ~34% and the MSCI Argentina ETF (ARGT) higher by more than 10% in volume which tracked 9,800% above average in early trading.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nAs is the case throughout history, crisis tends to lead to opportunity for investors. In the case of Argentina, the real opportunity may be in Bitcoin. Because Argentina is in such financial trouble, the economic picture remains muddled regardless of who’s in office. However, the election results are bullish for Bitcoin for two main reasons. First, Milei is the second pro-Bitcoin presidential candidate in Latin America to gain office (El Salvador’s Nayib Bukele was the first).\n\nStory continues\n\nBetween the two shocking election outcomes and a wave of US politicians embracing Bitcoin, the momentum is shifting politically on a grand scale. Second, and most importantly, Bitcoin is being used in the real world to stave off inflation. The evidence? Following the election news, Bitcoin hit new highs in three inflation-plagued countries, including Nigeria, Turkey, and, of course, Argentina. The evidence is clear: world citizens are gravitating toward Bitcoin because of its inflation-resistant protocol (there will only ever be 21 million coins, while countries around the world print money endlessly). Year-to-date, Bitcoin is up a robust 351% versus the Argentine Peso.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nBitcoin Supply is Stagnant\n\nOver the weekend, Bitcoin analyst Will Clemente pointed out that “88% of Bitcoin supply hasn’t moved in at least three months.” In other words, many investors seem to be shifting to a long-term mindset. Because Bitcoin has a fixed supply, as the remaining supply wanes and investor demand increases, Bitcoin should rally further.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Glassnode, Will Clemente\n\nInstitutional Appetite\n\nLong-awaited approval of ETFs will likely mean a quantum leap for the Bitcoin asset class. With juggernauts such as Fidelity and BlackRock (BLK) applying for ETFs, demand will soar from both institutions and retail investors should the ETFs be approved (they likely will be). In the meantime, Bitcoin proxies such as the ProShares Bitcoin ETF (BITO), Coinbase (COIN), and MicroStrategy (MSTR) should benefit dramatically.\n\n\n\n\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In this article, we will explore the basics of Bitcoin, delve into the principles of Austrian Economics, and examine the unique insights provided by Tuur Demeester, a renowned expert in both fields.\n\nThe Role of Bitcoin in Today's Economy\n\nMoreover, Bitcoin has become a store of value for many individuals who see it as a hedge against fiat currency devaluation. Its decentralized nature and limited supply have led some to view it as digital gold, a safe haven asset in times of economic uncertainty. This perception has been further reinforced by institutional investors and corporations, such as MicroStrategy and Tesla, allocating a portion of their treasury reserves to Bitcoin.\n\nIt is important to note that Bitcoin's impact extends beyond its monetary value. The underlying principles of decentralization, transparency, and censorship resistance have inspired a broader movement for financial sovereignty and individual empowerment. Bitcoin has become a symbol of resistance against centralized authorities and a catalyst for reimagining the future of money.\n\nThe Principles of Austrian Economics\n\nLet us turn our attention to the principles of Austrian Economics. Austrian Economics is a school of economic thought that emphasizes individual freedom, free markets, and limited government intervention. Its origins can be traced back to the works of economists such as Carl Menger, Friedrich Hayek, Murray Rothbard, and Ludwig von Mises.\n\nThe Origin and Evolution of Austrian Economics\n\nAustrian Economics emerged as a reaction to the prevailing economic theories of the time, which focused on mathematical models and central planning. Its proponents argued that economics should be grounded in the study of individuals' actions and choices, rather than abstract aggregates. Over the years, Austrian Economics has evolved and gained prominence, attracting a dedicated following of scholars and practitioners.\n\nKey Tenets of Austrian Economics\n\nAustrian Economics is characterized by several key principles. Firstly, it emphasizes the subjective nature of value, arguing that value is determined by individuals' preferences and choices. Secondly, it highlights the importance of entrepreneurship and market competition in driving economic growth and innovation.\n\nFurthermore, Austrian Economics emphasizes the role of the price mechanism in coordinating economic activity. Prices, according to Austrian economists, communicate crucial information about scarcity and consumer preferences. Finally, Austrian Economics advocates for sound money and opposes inflationary monetary policies.\n\nTuur Demeester: A Brief Introduction\n\nDemeester's Background and Influence\n\nTuur Demeester is an economist and investor who has extensively studied Bitcoin and Austrian Economics. He is the founder of Adamant Capital, an investment firm specializing in Bitcoin research. Demeester's research and analysis have contributed significantly to the understanding of Bitcoin's economic implications and its relation to Austrian Economics.\n\nDemeester's Views on Bitcoin and Austrian Economics\n\nDemeester has highlighted the compatibility between Bitcoin and Austrian Economics. He argues that Bitcoin's decentralized and permissionless nature aligns with the principles of Austrian Economics, which emphasize individual freedom and free markets. Demeester sees Bitcoin as a potential disruptor to traditional financial systems and believes it can empower individuals by providing them with financial sovereignty.\n\nThe Intersection of Bitcoin and Austrian Economics\n\nDemeester's Perspective on Bitcoin as a Free Market\n\nDemeester sees Bitcoin as a manifestation of the free market principles advocated by Austrian Economics. The absence of a centralized authority controlling Bitcoin's issuance and transaction validation aligns with the Austrian belief in spontaneous order and voluntary exchanges. Bitcoin's open-source nature allows anyone to participate and contribute, making it a truly decentralized ecosystem.\n\nThe Role of Bitcoin in Austrian Economic Theory\n\nBitcoin's emergence has sparked debates within the Austrian Economics community. Some argue that Bitcoin represents a digital form of Austrian economics in practice, as it operates outside the control of central banks and governments. Others contend that Bitcoin's lack of intrinsic value and its volatility make it an unsuitable representation of Austrian economic principles.\n\nCriticisms and Counter Arguments\n\nAs with any subject of interest, Bitcoin and Austrian Economics have not been immune to criticisms. Let us examine some common criticisms and explore Demeester's responses.\n\nCommon Criticisms of Bitcoin in Austrian Economics\n\nOne common criticism argues that Bitcoin's price volatility renders it unreliable as a medium of exchange. Critics claim that the constant fluctuation in value undermines its suitability as a store of value and..."}]

The initial report came from the Wall Street Journal, which said Zhao would soon step down as CEO of the exchange and plead guilty to violating U.S. anti-money-laundering laws. Court documents have since confirmed this.\n\nBinance will also plead guilty to a criminal charge and pay $4.3 billion in fines, which will allow it to settle civil charges brought against it by regulators. Zhao himself will pay $50 million.\n\nAs BNB fell, so did the broader crypto market, with the global cryptocurrency market cap dropping 3.5% over the past day to $1.43 trillion, according to CoinGecko. Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, fell just under 2% following news of the charges against Zhao and Binance.\n\nBinance initially sold millions of BNB in 2019, and currently allows customers to use the tokens for a discount on trading. The company and Zhao still hold billions of dollars worth of the coin.\n\nThe Justice Department is scheduled to hold a press conference at 3 p.m. Eastern Time on the criminal charges.

However, the company announced on Monday that it had adjusted its direction based on feedback received from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe revised plan, approved by a U.S. bankruptcy court in Manhattan on November 9, allowed Celsius to return cryptocurrency to its customers and establish a new company owned by Celsius creditors.

What U.S. Marshals Seize and sell. So the U.S. Marshals are seizing these this contraband item. Who are they taking it from? What kind of criminals are we talking about here? Oh, you can kind of like take your pick. It's people who are involved in drug dealing, money laundering, Darkweb, the Internet stuff when they're selling drugs and malware and other sorts of things, then the items that the marshals seize are those that are basically proceeds from a crime or things that are used in the commission of crimes. And Michael, if I'm in the market to buy a Rolex, how do I attend one of these auctions and get my hand on a Rolex, which according to reporting, is at a pretty decent discount? Oh, yeah. That's the hard part, is sometimes that discount goes away. But these auctions happen online fairly often, and they partner with these national auction houses that basically like when you had a lot of really interesting things. Was there an item that stood out the most to you when you were doing your sleuthing through some of these filings? I think the racehorse was a really interesting one. That was the only animal that we saw on this list, and it was from an attorney who was basically taking funds from family members and other clients and used it to buy racehorses and all sorts of other things. Yeah, seem like Rolexes were a dime a dozen. There are a lot of Rolexes on there. Are there a couple of cars, classic cars? There's also digital coins, which you found were very a big haul in 2021. Makes sense given the price action. Yeah, absolutely. And I think, you know, unintentionally, the government probably made one of the best crypto trades of all time because they had they had all of this crypto that they seized and then sold it when it was basically at the highs. So I think it was something like $39 million from like 680 Bitcoin or something like they time the market like right at the top and entirely unintentionally, just given the way that the crypto markets were acting and upon. You know what interested me in all this? And we talk about, you know, this racehorse, the private jets, the boats, the digital coins, is that the auction data is not really accessible to the public. You actually had to file a Freedom of Information Act to get all this data to get five years worth of sales. Why is it not available to most people? Why is it not more public, given that the U.S. Marshal services are seizing this from criminals and taxpayers are funding a lot of these efforts? Yeah, I mean, they have annual reports. Second kind of breakdown of how much is being sold every year and how many items have been sold and how much has been given out in terms of victim compensation and that kind of thing. But there's no central database that tells you like they sold this Pokemon card on February 8th or whatever. So I don't know why they don't maintain a database that would have made my job a lot easier and I wouldn't have had to wait six months for it. But sometimes you just have to file the request and see what happens. And I filed this in September 2022, and I got it back in July 2023. And luckily it was free, but I just had to wait a bunch of time and it was not an easy thing to kind of like convert and get into Excel. It was all on like a PDF. And so there's a lot of work that had to be done to kind of get the project to publication. And Michael, this story has a lot of really cool graphics. I'm looking at the jump though, from 20 1922 and a half million dollars to more than $83 million in 2021. Is that more things being seized by the marshals, the more expensive items? What drove the run up because that was still before COVID. Yeah, there is a big ol cryptocurrency that was in there. And then I think the second biggest category is cars as well. So I want to say that part of the reason why that jump is so big is some of those crypto sales and you mentioned the graphics. Amanda Chan did a fantastic job putting all of this together. She's a Business Week designer. Where does this money go? Yes, When it is? Yes. What like the greatest, as you mentioned, great crypto trade by the U.S. government. Does it go to schools? Does it go to can they fund the government, fund the deficit? Yes. It does not go back to Treasury or anything like that. There's no deficit reduction or anything happening. It goes back to local law enforcement and then there's victim compensation funds to like if you were somebody who had been a victim of some sort of scammer crime and somebody, you know, stole your money to buy racehorses or cars or something like that, that money will hopefully go back to you. But it's not a sure process from what I heard. Like, I think they distributed $506 million of bonds last year, but some of that was around like prior years. So just like anything, it's going to take some time. We're talking we're talking to Bloomberg reporter Michael Tobin about a story about what U.S. marshals seize. M..."}]

Additionally, Celsius Network shifted its focus to Bitcoin mining post-bankruptcy restructuring due to regulatory concerns, potentially impacting its business model. The seizure and sale of assets by U.S. Marshals, including digital coins like Bitcoin, may have contributed to market fluctuations.

"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that there is some volatility in the ETH market, but overall, the trend seems to be leaning towards a positive direction with potential for further growth. The news analyst report highlights Warren Buffett's shift towards more traditional assets, suggesting a trend towards stability and established investment opportunities. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a slightly conservative approach focusing on long-term profitability and risk management in navigating the volatile market.

Synthesizing these reports, it is evident that while there may be fluctuations in the short term, the overall market trend for ETH appears to be positive with potential for growth. Therefore, a long-term strategy focusing on risk management and strategic decision-making is recommended to optimize profitability in the current market environment.

Considering the information provided, I would take a slightly bullish stance on ETH and make a trading action of 0.5, reflecting moderate confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately for long-term profitability.
ACTION:
0.5
DAILY RETURN:
0.021209199791991207
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that there is a positive trend in the ETH market with increasing activity and a bullish sentiment indicated by the MACD signal. The news analyst report also suggests a potential influx of capital into the cryptocurrency market, particularly with the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which could benefit digital assets like ETH. Additionally, the reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a slightly conservative approach to trading, focusing on long-term profitability and risk management.

Taking all reports into consideration, it can be inferred that the overall market trend for ETH is positive with potential for growth in the long term. While short-term gains may be possible, a strategic focus on long-term profitability and risk management is recommended to navigate the volatile market effectively.

Considering the synthesized reports and the emphasis on a slightly conservative approach, I would take a trading action with a confidence level of 0.7, indicating a moderate level of confidence in the positive market trend for ETH.

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that there is a positive trend in the ETH market with increasing on-chain activity and a bullish MACD signal. The news analyst report, on the other hand, highlights the growing interest in Bitcoin, but it does not necessarily indicate a negative impact on ETH. Finally, the reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a moderately aggressive trading approach focusing on long-term gains and risk management.

Considering all the reports, it can be inferred that the ETH market is likely to continue its upward trajectory in the near future, despite the positive sentiment towards Bitcoin. Therefore, a long-term strategy focusing on maximizing profitability while managing risk effectively seems to be the most appropriate approach.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend a trading action of 0.7, indicating a high level of confidence in the positive trend of the ETH market and a strategic decision to capitalize on long-term opportunities while mitigating risks.

After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that there is a bullish trend in the ETH market, supported by increasing unique addresses, coinbase transactions, and transaction fees. The MACD signal also indicates a buy position, further suggesting a positive market outlook.

This revelation is set to change the dynamics of earning through cryptocurrency.\n\nUnderstanding Bitcoin Mining in the Current Landscape\n\nBitcoin mining, a process of using computational power to transact and secure the Bitcoin network, remains a vital component of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This process involves miners verifying transactions, assembling them into "blocks," and adding them to the blockchain, a task that requires solving complex computational puzzles known as proof of work. Successful miners are rewarded with new Bitcoins, making the endeavor highly lucrative, especially considering the current BTC/USD exchange rates.\n\nThe Profitability of Bitcoin Mining\n\nBitcoin mining\'s profitability stems from its crucial role in maintaining the Bitcoin network\'s independence from centralized authorities. Every 10 minutes, miners confirm a block of transactions. The first to validate it earns a reward of 6.25 BTC, a significant sum given Bitcoin\'s current market value. However, the competitive nature of mining, driven by Bitcoin\'s value and the substantial rewards, necessitates significant investment in specialized hardware.\n\nGlobaleCrypto: A Game-Changer in Bitcoin Mining\n\nRecognizing the challenges of individual mining investments, GlobaleCrypto offers a compelling alternative with its cloud mining services .

Ben Mcshane | Sportsfile | Getty Images\n\nOutflows from Binance have amounted to more than $1 billion in the past 24 hours, not including bitcoin, according to data from blockchain analysis firm Nansen, after founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao stepped down and pleaded guilty Tuesday in a deal with the Department of Justice. Meanwhile, liquidity has dropped 25% over the same time frame as market makers pull back their positions, according to data provider Kaiko. The outflows are significant and close to what happened previously when the exchange and its founder were charged with 13 securities violations by the SEC.\n\nThe exchange\'s native token, BNB, is down more than 8% in the last 24 hours. Binance holds around $2.8 billion worth of BNB tokens, according to Nansen. And in March, after Binance phased out zero-fee trading of crypto asset pairs including bitcoin, a key incentive for customers, the exchange began to see its share of all spot trading drop. Binance remains the world\'s largest crypto exchange globally, processing billions of dollars in trading volume every year. Binance agreed to pay $4.3 billion in fines to the U.S. government. The plea deals end a yearslong investigation into the crypto exchange. Assets of more than $65 billion remain on the platform, according to Nansen, meaning that Binance is likely capitalized enough to withstand a sudden rush of investors away from the platform. And while withdrawals are on the up, there has not yet been a "mass exodus" of funds from the exchange. "After the momentary shock of the agreement with the announcement, there is no significant impact on most assets," said Grzegorz Drozdz, a market analyst at investment firm Conotoxia Ltd. "The cryptocurrency that seems to have suffered the most, losing more than 9%, is the BNB token from Binance. Of the top 100 cryptocurrencies, as many as 98 have seen a noticeable rebound over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin, meanwhile, fell 4% before rebounding and remaining with a loss of 1.3%," he said. Drozdz added that it may be a net positive for the industry now that the dispute with regulators is behind Binance and that the company has pledged to increase security measures. "This, combined with the likely imminent approval of an ETF based on bitcoin quotes, could positively impact the crypto market in the long term," said Drozdz.\n\nCan Binance survive at this stage?\n\nThat\'s the multibillion-dollar question the cryptocurrency giant faces after Zhao agreed to a plea deal and stepped down from the company. Started by the Chinese-born entrepreneur in 2017, Binance went from being a relatively obscure name to being a major force in crypto in a matter of weeks. Experts CNBC spoke with said that Binance is likely to make it through the ordeal despite a turbulent situation. They cited the company\'s decision to comply with the DOJ process and implement a three-year strategy to get its operations into compliance, and the amount of assets held within the company\'s reserves. "The sum of $4 billion is clearly very large and will create real pain for Binance\'s balance sheet," Yesha Yadav, Milton R. Underwood professor of law and associate dean at Vanderbilt University, told CNBC via email. "However, this fine does not appear aimed at dealing a fatal blow to the exchange. Based on Binance\'s dominant position within the crypto-ecosystem over a number of years, CZ\'s personal wealth ... and continuing trading volumes despite declines in overall crypto trading volume as well as in Binance\'s market share relative to other venues, I doubt that Binance will face risks to its solvency in paying this fine."\n\n$4.3 billion plea deal\n\nZhao and others were charged with violating the Bank Secrecy Act by failing to implement an effective anti-money-laundering program and for willfully violating U.S. economic sanctions "in a deliberate and calculated effort to profit from the U.S. market without implementing controls required by U.S. law," according to the Justice Department. Binance has agreed to forfeit $2.5 billion to the government and to pay a fine of $1.8 billion, for a total of $4.3 billion. U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a press conference Tuesday that it\'s "one of the largest penalties we have ever obtained." "Using new technology to break the law does not make you a disruptor. It makes you a criminal," Garland said. "Binance prioritized its profits over the safety of the American people." Zhao said Tuesday in a post on X, formerly Twitter, that he had "made mistakes" and "must take responsibility." Richard Teng, a former Abu Dhabi financial services regulator, was named as Zhao\'s replacement. Teng was most recently the global head of regional markets at Binance. He was also previously director of corporate finance at the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Th...'}]

The news articles suggest a mixed sentiment in the cryptocurrency market. On one hand, there is optimism surrounding the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF by the SEC, as evidenced by discussions between BlackRock and SEC officials. Additionally, Bitcoin's hash rate reaching an all-time high indicates a strong network ahead of the halving event. However, negative news surrounding Binance, with CEO Changpeng Zhao stepping down and pleading guilty, has led to significant outflows from the exchange.

After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that there is a positive trend in the ETH market with increasing activity and a bullish sentiment indicated by the MACD signal. The news analyst report also suggests a potential influx of capital into the cryptocurrency market, particularly with the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which could benefit digital assets like ETH. Additionally, the reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a slightly conservative approach to trading, focusing on long-term profitability and risk management.

Taking all reports into consideration, it can be inferred that the overall market trend for ETH is positive with potential for growth in the long term. While short-term gains may be possible, a strategic focus on long-term profitability and risk management is recommended to navigate the volatile market effectively.

Considering the synthesized reports and the emphasis on a slightly conservative approach, I would take a trading action with a confidence level of 0.7, indicating a moderate level of confidence in the positive market trend for ETH.

After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that there is a positive trend in the ETH market with increasing on-chain activity and a bullish MACD signal. The news analyst report, on the other hand, highlights the growing interest in Bitcoin, but it does not necessarily indicate a negative impact on ETH. Finally, the reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a moderately aggressive trading approach focusing on long-term gains and risk management.

Considering all the reports, it can be inferred that the ETH market is likely to continue its upward trajectory in the near future, despite the positive sentiment towards Bitcoin. Therefore, a long-term strategy focusing on maximizing profitability while managing risk effectively seems to be the most appropriate approach.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend a trading action of 0.7, indicating a high level of confidence in the positive trend of the ETH market and a strategic decision to capitalize on long-term opportunities while mitigating risks.

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a strategic focus on long-term profitability and risk management is crucial in navigating the cryptocurrency market. While short-term gains may be tempting, a more conservative trading approach may be warranted to capitalize on long-term opportunities and mitigate risks effectively.

Considering the synthesized reports, the overall market trend for ETH appears to be positive in the long term, despite potential short-term fluctuations.

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
The news articles suggest a positive outlook for Bitcoin, with potential price surges above $40,000 predicted by analysts following developments such as Binance's settlement and BlackRock's meetings with the SEC regarding spot Bitcoin ETFs. The increased interest from institutional investors, growing market capitalization of stablecoins like Tether, and favorable macroeconomic conditions all point towards a bullish trend for Bitcoin. Additionally, the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF could further boost market confidence and attract more mainstream capital into the cryptocurrency market, potentially leading to a rise in Ethereum (ETH) prices as well.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that there is a positive trend in the ETH market with increasing on-chain activity and a bullish MACD signal. The news analyst report, on the other hand, highlights the growing interest in Bitcoin, but it does not necessarily indicate a negative impact on ETH. Finally, the reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a moderately aggressive trading approach focusing on long-term gains and risk management.

Considering all the reports, it can be inferred that the ETH market is likely to continue its upward trajectory in the near future, despite the positive sentiment towards Bitcoin. Therefore, a long-term strategy focusing on maximizing profitability while managing risk effectively seems to be the most appropriate approach.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend a trading action of 0.7, indicating a high level of confidence in the positive trend of the ETH market and a strategic decision to capitalize on long-term opportunities while mitigating risks.
ACTION:
0.7
DAILY RETURN:
-0.045717080069974214
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that there is a bullish trend in the ETH market, supported by increasing unique addresses, coinbase transactions, and transaction fees. The MACD signal also indicates a buy position, further suggesting a positive market outlook. 

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights some caution in the market due to regulatory concerns and market fluctuations caused by recent events involving major cryptocurrency players like Binance and Celsius Network. These external factors may lead to short-term volatility and uncertainty in the market.

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a strategic focus on long-term profitability and risk management is crucial in navigating the cryptocurrency market. While short-term gains may be tempting, a more conservative trading approach may be warranted to capitalize on long-term opportunities and mitigate risks effectively.

Considering the synthesized reports, the overall market trend for ETH appears to be positive in the long term, despite potential short-term fluctuations. Therefore, I would take a slightly conservative approach and assign a trading action of 0.7, reflecting my confidence in the positive trend of the ETH market and my strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.
ACTION:
0.7
DAILY RETURN:

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that there is a bullish trend in the ETH market, supported by the consistent increase in open price, unique addresses, coinbase transactions, total size used, total value transferred, and total transactions. The MACD signal consistently indicating a buy signal further reinforces this positive outlook.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights some short-term volatility in the cryptocurrency market due to mixed sentiment. While there are positive developments such as discussions on a potential Bitcoin ETF approval and Bitcoin's strong network, negative news surrounding Binance could lead to some market fluctuations.

In reflection, it is evident that a strategic focus on long-term profitability and risk management has been effective in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. By prioritizing on-chain activity, MACD signals, and news analysis, traders can gain valuable insights into market trends and potential opportunities while mitigating risks effectively.

Considering the synthesized reports, the overall market trend for ETH appears to be positive in the long term, despite potential short-term volatility. Therefore, it is recommended to focus on long-term strategies over short-term gains to capitalize on future opportunities while managing risks appropriately.

Coin Metrics measures a week in crypto, which trades 24 hours a day, from 4:00 p.m. ET on a given Friday to the same time the following Friday. There was an array of events driving the price this week – from the election in Argentina , the minutes of the latest Fed meeting and updates to bitcoin ETF applications, to the Binance settlement and the leadership coup at OpenAI . These things not only highlighted the nuance in bitcoin\'s purpose and identity, it also put the crypto industry\'s long-standing regulatory woes back in focus for investors. "The thing I\'d be focused on over the short term is what kind of news we have on the regulatory front versus what is already discounted by traders," Zach Pandl, managing director of research at Grayscale Investments, told CNBC. "Are we going to see news that\'s positive enough that gives us new price highs given the way people are already positioned?" BTC.CM= 1Y mountain Bitcoin, 1 year For the year, bitcoin is up about 130% even after remaining stuck in a tight range for most of it. Optimism about the likely approval of a spot bitcoin ETF has been building for the past couple months, serving as the biggest catalyst for the cryptocurrency. Pandl (whose company is a key player in the push to get an ETF off the ground with its popular GBTC product) said he thinks the market will continue to get good news on the ETF front. Moreover, as the industry recovers from the black eye FTX dealt it this time last year, regulators are learning how to separate different market participants. "Regulators are very clearly segregating a variety of issues – on one hand, bad actors and parts of the business [of crypto] that we don\'t want to see continue, versus the asset management community [and] ETF community, which is just providing a product to the public," he said. The challenge is that active crypto trader positioning appears long, he added, based on activity in crypto futures, options, open interest and funding rates. "While we may hear more positive news about the prospect of an ETF approval, some of that is priced in so things need to happen sooner or more smoothly for them to incrementally move a price," he said. Meanwhile, Michael Rinko, a research analyst at Delphi Digital, said this week\'s Binance settlement is one piece of evidence of a new narrative forming in crypto regulation, one in which the Biden administration could be starting to view crypto through a similar lens to which they see technology fields like artificial intelligence and semiconductors. It may be a long while before crypto reaches the level of priority as AI, he added, but the latest Binance development is part of an emerging narrative. "Increasingly, the view in from the U.S. government\'s perspective is that they\'re viewing more and more technology through the lens of national security," he said. Rinko highlighted examples such as semiconductors and the CHIPS act and increasing engagement with AI leading to restrictions on some of Nvidia\'s higher-end chips, and said a similar path could be coming for crypto. Already underway is a sort of regulatory attack on the crypto players the U.S. deems unacceptable, he said, adding it will likely fracture the crypto world into two spheres. "There will be the Western sphere of influence where there\'s Coinbase , Kraken and exchanges that have relationships and ties to the so-called West, and then there will be Eastern exchanges that operate outside the influence and control of the U.S. and its allies and are persona non grata from a U.S. perspective," he said.'}]

The news articles suggest a mixed sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, with Cathie Wood's Ark Investment Management reducing its holdings in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust despite Bitcoin's recent price surge. On the other hand, Bhutan's secret Bitcoin mining facilities and positive regulatory developments, such as the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF and the Bank of Korea's CBDC pilot, indicate growing interest and adoption in the crypto space. However, regulatory uncertainties, highlighted by the trouble at Binance and the focus on crypto regulation by governments, could impact market sentiment.

However, this isn\'t the first time that crypto news created a stir of hype around digital assets, but is this time truly different?\n\nMarkus Thielen, DeFiResearch.com Head of Research, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss what this ETF approval could mean for bitcoin and the crypto space, and why he feels that if approved, it could potentially reach a high price target.\n\n"I think, to put it in numbers, there\'s around $120 billion US dollars in precious metals ETFs in the US, so that means in gold and in silver, and if you just move 10-20% of those and shift them over into bitcoin you have certainly sort of something in the range of like $25 billion of inflow," Thielen says.

And as you talk about the spot bitcoin ETF, other countries that have launched it didn\'t see a massive rally. Why will this time be different?\n\nMARKUS THIELEN: Well, the US is, of course, the largest pool of capital. And of course, ETFs are only really established in the US. You know, we have seen this a long time, you know, in Asia, how Asia tried to establish ETFs. But people don\'t really use them, and I think this is because the investor base is very different for the US market than anywhere else.\n\nAnd the US is really dominated by a lot of institutions. And those institutions are using ETFs really in their asset allocation. Of course, we have the registered investment advisor community, and estimates vary from-- you know, they managed 5 trillion to even more. But if they move like one of those-- 1% of those 5 trillion, that\'s like 50 billion into bitcoin, right?\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd I think that could have like a big impact because we sort of can calculate if the market cap changes, you know, what might be the implications for the price of bitcoin. And what has really changed is really that we have, you know, certain judges telling around the-- telling the SEC around the grayscale lawsuit to go back and reevaluate their estimates.\n\nWe\'re having BlackRock as, you know, the largest asset manager in the world also filing for a bitcoin ETF. So I think the pressure is really building. And then there is an overall sentiment that the market had that the US regulatory regime is trying to clean up the market. So-- and the last missing piece in this puzzle was for example to sort of like eliminate an exchange from the US market that has been known and admitted to had, you know, illicit trading going on.\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: Marcus, you said even if one of these bitcoin ETFs move that could have a big impact. We\'re looking at bitcoin roughly at $37,000 right now. What does that move look like? How much higher can it go?\n\nMARKUS THIELEN: Yeah. I think, you know, we have we have heard a false rumor that proved not true where bitcoin rallied 10%, you know, literally in a heartbeat. So we would estimate if a if a spot bitcoin ETF would be approved. Bitcoin could go up easily 20%. And I think you know to put it in numbers, there\'s around $120 billion USD in precious metals ETFs in the US. So that means in gold and in silver.\n\nAnd if you just move you know 10, 20% of those, shift them over into bitcoin, you know, you have certainly sort of something in the range of like $25 billion of inflow. And we calculated this might have actually an impact of every $1 billion, a 4% impact on the price. So we might actually see kind of a price towards kind of 57,000 we calculated we can see if there an approval for the bitcoin ETF.\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: 57,000 in the medium term?\n\nMARKUS THIELEN: In the medium term, yes. I mean, it sounds reasonable, right, when you look at-- you know, we were just at 25,000 like two months ago, and now we\'re at 37,000. So this is just literally like you know sort of like 12,000 rally that we had, so another 12,000 point rally. You know, it gets us already like two to the 50,000 point area.\n\nSo I think this can easily happen. And again, as I said, if you if you put in kind of the macro tailwinds of the fed pausing, if you compare to the 2017 episode when the CME announced the bitcoin future, I mean, I think there is just a lot of tailwind, and I think there\'s a lot of pent up demand. And you know, don\'t forget we have all these ETF providers. They are, of course, doing a lot of marketing. There are a lot of educational.\n\nAnd, you know, Larry Fink as the CEO from blackrock is almost you know every other day on TV and saying how important the bitcoin ETF is. So I think...'}]

Geoff Kendrick and the team at the bank conveyed their confidence that the approval of various spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States will serve as the next driving force behind the cryptocurrency\'s expansion, with these events expected to happen earlier than initially foreseen.\n\nThe bank anticipates that multiple spot ETFs for both BTC and ETH will likely be granted approval in the first quarter of 2024, thereby paving the way for heightened institutional investment. Furthermore, Standard Chartered emphasized the forthcoming Bitcoin "halving," an event that restricts the currency\'s supply and is predicted to occur in late April 2024, as an additional factor that could contribute to potential price increases.\n\nStandard Chartered originally predicted BTC will hit $120,000 by end of next year, attributing Bitcoin\'s triumph to its status as a reputable safe haven asset. The bank maintains BTC\'s dominance, stating: “BTC’s dominance remains intact – its share of overall digital assets market cap has increased to 50% from 45% in April."\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form.'}, {'id': 26, 'time': 'Tue, 28 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Watch Bitcoin Rally Continues Crossing $38,000 - Bloomberg', 'content': "00:00\n\nAnd what you will find is it is broadly an update for digital assets really rallying across the board.

So it's been about a year and a half ether, Of course, taking part in this rally, though it has been lagging behind the recent rally we have seen in Bitcoin in Bitcoin to a large degree, it's up by about 2.9% on the day in that action. And really across the digital asset space, you're seeing tokens moving higher is feeding back into crypto related equities, one of them being Marathon digital. It's higher by about seven and a half percent on the day. And Coinbase generally one I know you're paying a lot of attention to, it's up by about 6% at this point in the session. Coinbase has really been lighting up the internet as well. A lot of people talking about it on the platform now known as X. And remember, it has not only been up every day since we've seen struggles that big multibillion dollar settlement over at big rival Binance, it's actually been on quite a tear, Kelly, since it's hit its October lows again, Of course, some of that some of that is helped by that love in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. But really, it's almost an 80% rise since it retested its lows in October. And if you pull out the chart even more, you would see that it's nearly quadrupled since its December lows that it hit last year.

The bounce has ignited broader interest in the crypto space sooner than anticipated.\n\nRelated stories\n\n"Going forward, then, we expect digital assets\' rising overall market cap to be a bigger driver of BTC price upside than a continued rise in BTC dominance within the space," Kendrick wrote.\n\nMeanwhile, sales of mined bitcoin have dropped to around 80% in the fourth quarter, as miners tend to hold larger quantities of the token as its price rises.\n\nNew supply will also be diminished by next April\'s bitcoin halving, a recurring event that reduces the amount of tokens awarded for mining. Typically, prices peak 12-18 months after it occurs, Kendrick said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut a positive surprise is also emerging from the demand side, given the rising likelihood that bitcoin spot ETFs become approved for US markets, he added.\n\n"We now expect more price upside to materialize before the halving than we previously did, specifically via the earlier-than-expected introduction of US spot ETFs. This suggests a risk that the USD 100,000 level could be reached before end-2024," Kendrick wrote.\n\nThat\'s as the SEC\'s attempts to block spot ETFs have suffered a number of court losses. The ETFs would bring fresh capital into bitcoin, as they would allow traditional brokerage accounts access to the cryptocurrency.\n\nFalling Treasury yields can further propel bitcoin, given that crypto tends to be a very long-term trade, Kendrick added. The 30-year yield has dropped to 4.60% from last month\'s high of 5.17%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStandard Chartered\'s bullishness was recently joined by analysts at Bernstein, who predicted that bitcoin could hit $150,000 by mid-2025 given similar supply reasons.'}, {'id': 23, 'time': 'Tue, 28 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Bitcoin rally: What the charts show - Yahoo Finance', 'content': "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is up more than 40% over the last three months. Investors are waiting to hear if the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve a spot bitcoin ETF, with inflows into the cryptocurrency surging the last five weeks.

Let's take a look at the crypto market because Bitcoin bulls are ready to charge. Bitcoin looking for direction this morning as investors' anticipation over an eventual US spot Bitcoin ETF, has pushed the cryptocurrency higher in the last three months. The question now, though, is whether this rally has staying power into the new year. Jared Blikre joining us with maybe a closer look at some of those technicals and the momentum that we've seen. Jared, what do you think?\n\nJARED BLIKRE: Well, I'm looking at inflows into Bitcoin and this chart goes back to the beginning of the year. And we are on the ninth straight week of inflows into Bitcoin, approaching about $300 million. This is the highest week of the year. And just looking, we can see a lot of activity over the last five weeks. Why? Whatever happened five weeks ago? We got a huge breakout in price.\n\nAnd let's go to the Bitcoin chart. And let's do a year to date. And we can plot this, you can see we really got going in about mid-October here. And you can even see that better with the candlesticks. We got that huge break above 30,000 and then 35,000. Huge, huge sticking points. And the reason those were sticking points is because there is a lot of price memory.\n\nLet me change this back to a line chart. And you can see we are now firmly in the bottom area of all this price history that we had in 2021. Lots of things sorted out in there. Suffice to say, it's going to take a lot to get through there.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs it going to happen slowly, quickly? Depends on the catalyst. But the regulatory environment finally seems to be getting a little bit more habitable for crypto players. It looks like Binance is probably going to skate with a $4 billion fine. But the industry itself is going to survive. And they've taken their lumps over the last couple of years. For the industry to bounce back now, I'd say yes, the bad, the worst is definitely in the past. And there's a lot of smooth sailing ahead. But exactly how that plays out, it's hard to see.\n\nI think the spot Bitcoin ETF, that's probably priced in. But you never know. There could be another burst of enthusiasm around that. Anecdotally, I will say the only time I get recognized in the streets of New York is when crypto prices are popping, and I'm not getting recognized. So I know we haven't gotten that level-- gotten to that level in this cycle yet.\n\nSEANA SMITH: It's weird. I didn't know you were so tied to the crypto. I never would have guessed that.\n\nJARED BLIKRE: Apparently, I am personally levered to Bitcoin prices. I don't know what's in that, but that's the way it happens. So I started getting recognized, yeah, I'll be really bullish, but we're just in the beginning stages right now, guys.\n\nDIANE KING HALL: All right, Jared Blikre. We will have to put a pin in that one and come back to you. We'll watch out for you for your man on the street Bitcoin quote.\n\nJARED BLIKRE: That's a great idea, Diane. Man on the street, person on the street Bitcoin. We're going to do that.\n\nDIANE KING HALL: Exactly. All right, thank you, Jared."}]

According to their findings, a one in four Americans and 55% of surveyed investors, defined by Unchained as those with at least one investment account between the ages of 18 and 78, own bitcoin.\n\nThe study, which surveyed 402 US investors, revealed that 95% of current BTC owners are considering increasing their holdings in 2024. Remarkably, almost half of non-BTC owners expressed a strong inclination towards purchasing bitcoin within the upcoming year.\n\nKey drivers influencing potential BTC purchases in 2024 include increased regulatory clarity around digital assets, with 42% of current BTC owners and 35% of non-owners highlighting this factor. Other influential elements identified were the potential approval of a bitcoin spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the anticipation of a US economic recession.\n\nDespite BTC's price being down over 50% from its peak, 79% of investors foresee BTC surpassing its all-time high of $69,000. More optimistically, over half of the surveyed investors (55%) predict a new all-time high for BTC in 2024, with a third believing BTC will outperform cash, gold, and the S&P 500.\n\nUnchained's survey also foresees a significant rise in bitcoin allocation within retirement portfolios. Nearly half of current BTC owners have BTC in their retirement accounts, and an additional 35% are considering adding it in 2024. Among non-BTC owners open to investing in the asset, 23% expressed interest in including BTC in their retirement accounts.\n\n“At Unchained, we are seeing an influx of bitcoin newcomers who now understand that the asset has longevity,” stated Joe Kelly, co-founder and CEO of Unchained. “As reflected in both Unchained’s survey results and the activity of our clients, US investors are eager to gain or expand bitcoin exposure — especially through tax-advantaged vehicles like Unchained’s bitcoin IRA. As more investors look to open or grow their bitcoin positions, Unchained looks forward to serving them whether it be through collaborative custody, the Unchained IRA, our trading desk, or our inheritance solutions.”\n\nWith an estimated 158 million Americans owning investment accounts, Unchained's survey provides valuable insights, representing the US investor population with a 5% margin of error at a 95% confidence level. The survey, conducted digitally from October 26 to 28, 2023, during a period when the price of bitcoin ranged from $33,610 to $34,977, offers a compelling outlook on BTC sentiment and expectations for 2024.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."}, {'id': 14, 'time': 'Wed, 29 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT', 'title': '1 Top Crypto Stock to Buy for Bitcoin Exposure - Nasdaq', 'content': "Investing in cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin (BTCUSD), has helped investors derive game-changing returns over the past decade. Bitcoin prices have surged 120x in the last eight years, 7x in the last five years, and more than doubled in 2023. Despite these market-thumping returns, Bitcoin is also down 40% from all-time highs, allowing investors to buy the dip.\n\nBitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency, which means it is not governed by any regulatory authority such as a central bank. It uses peer-to-peer technology and blockchain technology to record transactions - effectively, a distributed public ledger that can be verified or accessed by anyone. Miners verify and process these transactions and are rewarded with a set amount of BTC, as well as transaction fees.\n\nBitcoin was created 15 years ago, and the first block was mined in January 2009. The total supply of BTC is limited to 21 million, making it deflationary in nature. More than 19 million BTC have already been mined and are in circulation.\n\nInvestors can gain exposure to this alternate asset class by purchasing Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on exchanges such as Coinbase (COIN). Further, you can buy shares of Coinbase and other crypto-related stocks to gain exposure to digital assets by proxy.\n\nAnother way is to buy shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR), which acts as a Bitcoin holding company. Let’s see why.\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nMicroStrategy Goes Big on Bitcoin\n\nValued at $7.34 billion by market cap, MicroStrategy provides enterprise-facing analytics software and services. In Q3 of 2023, MicroStrategy reported revenue of $129.5 million, an increase of 3.3% year over year.\n\nWhile it is involved in the enterprise software segment, the CEO of MicroStrategy, Michael Saylor, is quite bullish on Bitcoin, and has famously allocated significant company resources to purchase BTC over the years. While MSTR has $45 million in cash, it also holds 140,000 Bitcoin worth over $4.4 billion at current prices.\n\nMicroStrategy is among the largest institutional holders of Bitcoin, and first began purchasing the digital asset as a hedge against inflation back in August 2020. In fact, MicroStrategy has also raised debt to fund its BTC purchases, and now owns 0.75% of the total Bitcoin circulating supply.\n\nWill Bitcoin Prices Keep Rising In 2024?\n\nIt's evident that the price of MSTR stock will be tied to the performance of Bitcoin. For instance, BTC prices have risen 129% year-to-date, while MSTR is up 259% in 2023.\n\nThere are two key drivers for BTC in the near term. First is the possible launch of multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs by institutions such as BlackRock (BLK), Invesco (IVZ), and Ark Invest. With trillions of dollars in assets under management, there is a good chance for Bitcoin demand to move higher once the ETFs are approved, possibly within the next six months.\n\nAnother positive catalyst for BTC prices is the upcoming halving event. Every four years, the amount of BTC that can be mined is reduced by 50%, resulting in an extended bull run due to the supply-demand economics.\n\nHere's a look at how Bitcoin has performed over the last three halving cycles.\n\nBitcoin prices surged over 5,000% between November 2011 and November 2013\n\nBitcoin prices again surged by over 5,000% between November 2015 and December 2017\n\nBitcoin prices rose 600% between November 2019 and November 2021\n\nIf you're bullish on Bitcoin, it makes sense to buy MSTR right now. Each of the four analysts tracking MicroStrategy stock has a “strong buy” recommendation. The average price target for MSTR is $516, which is only about 1% higher than the current trading price. However, BTIG sees about 10% upside, and called MSTR the best vehicle for institutional investors to gain BTC exposure in a recent note.\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nOn the date of publication, Aditya Raghunath did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Here's Why - Nasdaq", 'content': 'What a difference a year can make. Last year, Bitcoin (BTC-USD) lost nearly two-thirds of its value, and skeptics were ready to leave it for dead. This year, Bitcoin has come roaring back with a torrid gain of 128% in 2023. While 2023 has been a momentous year for the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, it can head even higher next year based on two potential catalysts that could both occur in early 2024: its upcoming halving and the potential for the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF. I\'m bullish on BTC.\n\nGet Ready for The Halving\n\nBitcoin’s next halving event is expected to occur in April 2024. What does the halving entail?\n\nHalvings are scheduled events that take place every four years, in which the reward for mining a new block of Bitcoin is cut in half. Right now, Bitcoin miners receive a reward of 6.25 new Bitcoins for each block that they mine. After the halving, this reward will be reduced to 3.125 BTC.\n\nThere are only 21 million Bitcoins that will ever exist, and this fixed supply is one of Bitcoin\'s primary selling points. Unlike fiat currencies, which governments and central banks can always print more of, Bitcoin is a finite resource. The halving helps to curb Bitcoin’s inflation rate and ensures that Bitcoin becomes increasingly scarce over time, which should theoretically increase its value over time.\n\nTo be clear, nothing is guaranteed, but past halvings have typically ushered in significant bull markets for Bitcoin. During the first Bitcoin halving in 2012, the block reward decreased from 50 BTC to 25 BTC, and the price of Bitcoin increased from about $12 before the halving to over $960 one year later.\n\nDuring the second Bitcoin halving in 2016, the reward decreased from 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC, and the price of Bitcoin nearly quadrupled one year later, from $663 to about $2,500.\n\nLastly, during the most recent halving, which occurred in 2020, the block reward decreased from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC, and the price of Bitcoin went parabolic, rising from about $8,500 before the halving to an all-time high of around $69,000 in November of 2021.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin came down considerably from this all-time high, and past results are no guarantee of future results. However, this illustrates the effect that past halvings have had on the price of Bitcoin. Based on these results, it’s easy to see why crypto market participants are enthusiastic about the next halving.\n\nImpact of a Potential Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval\n\nIt’s not just the halving that could serve as a catalyst for Bitcoin in 2024. Some market observers believe that the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF by the SEC is becoming increasingly likely and that it will come in early 2024.\n\nBlackRock (NYSE:BLK) kicked off the excitement this summer with its spot Bitcoin ETF filing and was soon followed by a mix of traditional finance giants like Fidelity and Invesco (NYSE:IVZ), tech-centric ARK Invest, and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTC:GBTC), which is seeking to convert its trust into an ETF. Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart have forecasted a 90% likelihood that a spot Bitcoin ETF will be approved for trading by January 2024.\n\nBalchunas has noted that ARK Invest, BlackRock, and others are updating their S1 filings, which could be a good sign, as it means that these issuers are getting their applications in shape for approval. Balchunas and other observers have also noted that BlackRock and others have been meeting with the SEC to hash out details and that this dialogue is another good sign.\n\nIt should be pointed out that this is all speculation at this point, but the developments do seem encouraging.\n\nTo be clear, speculation and excitement about the possibility of such an ETF has already driven the price of Bitcoin higher in 2024. The current Bitcoin rally really kicked into overdrive this summer after news of BlackRock\'s filing broke.\n\nWhile this could potentially make an approval a "buy the rumor, sell the news" event in the short term, over the long term, a spot Bitcoin ETF would usher in a new era for Bitcoin.\n\nMillions of U.S. investors would be able to gain direct exposure to Bitcoin through their brokerage or retirement accounts for the first time, making the process of gaining Bitcoin exposure as simple as buying a stock or an ETF.\n\nThis would open up access to Bitcoin to investors who are interested in it or bullish on its long-term potential but who don’t want to manage their own Bitcoin wallet or open up a dedicated crypto brokerage account with Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) or another provider. These ETFs could also bring more institutional investors into Bitcoin.\n\nFurthermore, ETFs from recognizable and trusted blue-chip names in the traditional finance world, like BlackRock, Fidelity, and others who have filed, would make many investors feel more comfortable with Bitcoin and boost its credibility with mainstream, non-crypto investors.\n\nLooking Ahead to 2024\n\nBitcoin has had an epic run in 2023, but 2024 could see it add to the...'}]
