Bitcoin is up more than 80% for the year, now accounting for a staggering 50% of the capitalization of the entire crypto market. But there\'s more to crypto than just Bitcoin.\n\nRight now, I have two growth cryptocurrencies on my radar for July: Solana (SOL 0.77%) and Render Token (RNDR 0.20%). Due to their superior growth prospects, both have the potential to soar much higher than Bitcoin in the second half of 2023. Let\'s take a closer look.\n\nSolana\n\nSolana is a top Layer-1 blockchain once known as a potential "Ethereum-killer." The problem is that Solana is still trying to recover from the meltdown of crypto exchange FTX last year. Due to its extensive links with the former chief executive officer of the exchange, Sam Bankman-Fried, Solana was arguably the crypto hit hardest by the FTX collapse.\n\nOn top of that, in early June, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) named Solana as an "unregistered security" in lawsuits filed against cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase Global (COIN 8.59%) and Binance (BNB 0.86%). So let\'s be clear: Solana is hardly a safe investment, and you have to be willing to take on quite a bit of risk.\n\nThat said, Solana has performed significantly better than expected this year. Despite so many regulatory issues swirling around it, Solana has almost doubled year. And at less than $20, it is still well below where it was trading when the FTX collapse occurred. As Solana\'s core metrics, such as those related to non-fungible tokens (NFTs), return to pre-FTX levels, I fully expect Solana to regain its price level from November 2022.\n\nAs a sign of better things yet to come, Solana recently surpassed Ethereum in terms of 24-hour NFT sales volume for the first time in its history. But that\'s just the start of the Solana comeback. In mid-April, Solana introduced its $1,000 Saga "crypto phone." This mobile phone launch is the next key step in the company\'s mobile crypto strategy, which has been under way for over a year.\n\nFrom my perspective, the launch of a new hardware product this year is a potentially huge growth catalyst for Solana and one big reason I\'m bullish on the company\'s long-term future prospects. According to Solana, the new mobile crypto strategy could result in the onboarding of many new blockchain users around the globe.\n\nRender Token\n\nRender is the crypto token of the Render Network, a distributed graphics processing unit (GPU) rendering network built using blockchain technology. In layperson\'s terms, the Render Network is where you go when you need more computing power for "rendering" (i.e., creating) hyper-realistic digital worlds. This is important for video games, metaverse worlds, and just about any form of high-end entertainment content. As such, Render has the support of some top names in Hollywood, including renowned film director J.J. Abrams.\n\nFrom my perspective, Render is a "pick-and-shovel play" for the digital gold rush. Instead of trying to determine which metaverse world or video game will be the next big hit, you\'re investing in a network powering the creation of all forms of digital entertainment. In short, Render is providing picks and shovels to digital creators. If you\'ve ever created a brief video on your computer and then waited a seemingly interminable amount of time for it to render, you can appreciate the problem Render is trying to solve.\n\nYear to date, Render Token is up almost 400%. And there could be plenty more growth ahead since the need for raw computing power is not going away anytime soon. Consider, for example, the impact new generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology has already had on creativity. With just a single text prompt, it\'s now possible to create ultra-realistic photos and videos. As another example, take Apple\'s (AAPL 1.66%) recent launch of a $3,000 mixed-reality headset. Developers will need to create 3D, immersive experiences for this headset, right?\n\nBut can they outperform Bitcoin?\n\nIn the first six months of 2023, only a handful of top cryptocurrencies with market capitalizations above $500 million outperformed Bitcoin. Both Solana and Render were in that group. The big question, of course, is whether they can continue to outperform Bitcoin over the second half of 2023. There is, for example, still quite a bit of regulatory risk swirling around Solana.\n\nSo if you\'re risk-averse or skeptical that the crypto market can rally much higher this year, you might be better off just sticking to Bitcoin. But if you have a big risk appetite and are looking for huge potential growth opportunities in the crypto market, both Solana and Render could be worth a closer look.'}, {'id': 3, 'time': 'Fri, 07 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Solana is Predicted to Drop to $\u202f18.42 By Jul 12, 2023 - CoinCodex', 'content': 'Disclaimer: This is not investment advice.

The medium-term trend for Solana has been bearish, with SOL dropping by -0.57% in the last 3 months. The long-term picture for Solana has been negative, as SOL is currently displaying a -45.00% 1-year price change. On this day last year, SOL was trading at $ 37.05.\n\nSolana reached its all-time high price on Nov 06, 2021, when the price of SOL peaked at $ 259.52. The current SOL cycle high is $ 27.16, while the cycle low is at $ 8.12. SOL has been displaying low volatility recently – the 1-month volatility of the coin is at 9.25. Solana recorded 19 green days in the last 30 days.\n\nSolana technical analysis for today - Jul 07, 2023\n\nThe sentiment in the Solana markets is currently Neutral, and the Fear & Greed index is reading Greed. The most important support levels to watch are $ 18.93, $ 17.96 and $ 16.94, while $ 20.93, $ 21.95 and $ 22.92 are the key resistance levels.\n\nNeutral sentiment for Solana\n\n18 indicators are currently signaling a bullish prediction for Solana, while 9 indicators are showing a bearish forecast. With 67% of indicators favoring a positive prediction. This results in an overall Neutral sentiment for Solana.\n\nCrypto market is currently experiencing Greed\n\nCurrently, the Fear & Greed index is at 55 (Greed), which signals that investors have a positive outlook on the market. The Fear & Greed index is a measure of sentiment among cryptocurrency investors. A “Greed” reading suggests that investors are currently optimistic about the cryptocurrency market, but can also be an indication that the market is overvalued. A “Fear” reading, on the other hand, signals that investors are currently hesitant about the cryptocurrency market, which potentially represents a buying opportunity.\n\nSolana moving averages & oscillators\n\nLet’s take a look at what some of the most important technical indicators are signaling.

Now, start your response with your brief reasoning over the given reports. Then, based on the synthesized reports, conclude a clear market trend, emphasizing long-term strategies over short-term gains. Finally, indicate your trading action as a 1-decimal float in the range of [-1,1], reflecting your confidence in the market trend and your strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
After reviewing the reports from the on-chain analyst, news analyst, and reflection analyst, it is evident that there is a mixed outlook on the ETH market. The on-chain analyst report suggests a sell trend based on the MACD signal, indicating potential downward pressure on the price of ETH. The news analyst report highlights growth opportunities in other cryptocurrencies like Solana and Render Token, but also warns about regulatory issues and potential price drops. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of monitoring market trends and exercising caution in the current volatile market.

Considering the mixed signals and uncertainties in the market, it is crucial to adopt a more conservative and long-term approach to trading ETH. Short-term gains may be risky given the conflicting information and potential market volatility. It is advisable to focus on preserving capital and waiting for clearer opportunities to arise before making significant trades.

Therefore, my trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.5. This decision reflects a cautious approach in light of the uncertain market conditions and the potential downward pressure indicated by the on-chain analyst report. By managing risk appropriately and prioritizing long-term strategies over short-term gains, I aim to maximize overall profit in the ETH market.

Caleb Franzen, Founder of Cubic Analytics, suggests a three-step strategy for Solana’s price recovery to reach $27 as it recently crossed $20 mark.\n\nSolana Price To Reach $27\n\nCaleb Franzen, the Founder of Cubic Analytics, has shared his thoughts on Solana ($SOL) through a tweet. In his analysis, Franzen suggests that Solana is gearing up for another attempt at upward movement in its price.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAccording to Franzen, there are three key steps that Solana needs to follow to achieve this potential price increase. Step 1 involves breaking the trend line, which typically signifies a shift in market sentiment. Once the trend line is broken, Step 2 suggests that SOL should utilize this newly established trend line as a support level. Finally, in Step 3, Franzen sets a target price of approximately $27 for Solana.\n\nAs of now, $SOL is priced at $21.79, marking a 4.49% increase. The market capitalization stands at $8,750,222,715.

Within the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap, the SOL price recorded the second highest price increase within the last seven days with 8.5%. And the unexpected surge in price for many has catapulted the SOL token to arguably the most crucial resistance at the moment: the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA).\n\nLooking at the 1-day chart, the Solana share price was able to break above the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $19.71, as predicted in our last chart analysis, and subsequently crossed the psychologically important $20.00 mark. While the first attempt failed, the Solana bulls celebrated a resounding success in the second attempt.\n\nHowever, as predicted in our last price analysis, there was increased selling pressure at the 200-day EMA currently at $21.97, to which the bulls succumbed. Similar to the last week of June, a consolidation may now be needed first to reset the technical indicators. In mid-June, SOL posted a 26% rally, followed by a seven day consolidation (bull flag).\n\nRelated Reading\n\nSolana (SOL) Price Targets 40% Rally Amid Strong Fundamentals 10 months ago\n\nA similar scenario could be possible now. A retest of the 38.2% Fibonacci level at $19.71 could be on the table. Remarkably, the pressure on the bulls is huge as the Solana token has failed to break the 200-day EMA since April 2022. The most recent rejection occurred in April 2023, followed by a 44% crash.\n\nHowever, the external circumstances in the crypto market are different now. Due to the hope for a Bitcoin spot ETF, new life has been breathed into the altcoin market as well. Solana, despite its strong fundamentals, has been hit particularly hard by the FTX drama and more recently the SEC’s declaration of it as a security. Accordingly, a recovery offers plenty of upside potential.\n\nIf the 200-day EMA breaks, the 50% Fibonacci retracement level (at $23.36) would certainly be only a short intermediate level before the yearly high at $27.00, which also coincides with the 61.8% Fibonacci level. A break above this chart level could open the floodgates for an even more massive rally.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nHowever, in addition to a general uptrend in the overall crypto market, this will certainly require a Solana-specific catalyst. For the recent rally, this does not really seem to exist.\n\nReasons Behind The Recent Solana Price Rally\n\nWhile there isn’t a specific identifiable catalyst for Solana’s recent pump, several factors seem to be contributing to its upward trajectory. One driver has been the announcement of partnerships with notable entities. For instance, Coca-Cola in Serbia collaborated with Solana’s NFT platform, SolSea, to offer limited edition hoodies accompanied by NFTs during a music event.\n\n🥤 Coca-Cola in Serbia teams up with SolSea NFT platform 🌊 for a unique collaboration at a music event 🎵.\n\nThey’re giving away limited edition hoodies 🧥 and NFTs 🖼️ to lucky participants! pic.twitter.com/f4k3idGzvI — Solana NFTS Notification (@solananftsnews) July 9, 2023\n\nMoreover, Solana’s popularity on social media platforms cannot be overlooked, as on-chain data firm Santiment noted. The bullish sentiment surrounding Solana has reached new heights, with Reddit forums buzzing about the coin’s potential. Market influencers and Reddit traders have likely played a role in driving Solana’s price action, as their influence on market movements is well-documented. This social media hype has undoubtedly added fuel to the fire, propelling SOL’s price even higher.\n\nInterestingly, Solana faced a regulatory hurdle in June when it was threatened with delistings from several US exchanges due SEC lawsuits. However, the allegation that SOL is an unregistered security is vehemently denied by the Solana Foundation. Regardless of the ultimate outcome, this regulatory uncertainty has cast a shadow over Solana’s future, indicating potential challenges ahead.\n\nBut despite these obstacles, Solana has demonstrated resilience. After weathering the storm caused by the FTX bankruptcy, the platform has made an impressive recovery. Its technology, which enables rapid and reliable decentralized applications and cryptocurrency services, continues to captivate the market. This allure, coupled with the platform’s promising performance, has piqued the interest of investors and fueled expectations of further gains.\n\nSo while the exact catalyst behind Solana’s surge remains elusive, the combination of partnerships, social media buzz, and its resilient technology paints a picture of a cryptocurrency on the rise.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com'}]

Taking into account the reflection analyst report, which emphasizes a cautious and conservative approach based on thorough analysis, it is prudent to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains in the current volatile market environment. Given the conflicting signals from the on-chain and news reports, it is important to exercise caution and manage risk effectively.

Considering all the reports, the synthesized market trend for ETH appears to be cautiously optimistic in the long term, with potential for further gains if key resistance levels are surpassed. However, the short-term outlook remains bearish, indicating a need for a conservative trading approach.

Therefore, my trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.5, reflecting a cautious stance in light of the short-term bearish trend and the need to manage risk effectively in the current market conditions.

And so I think it\'s it\'s good for the community and it\'s good for business.

If the “dream scenario” for the world’s 10th largest cryptocurrency by market cap occurs, SOL could outperform both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).\n\nPal shared his massively bullish outlook for Solana during a recent interview in which he shared views on varied topics. These include AI and its impact on jobs, BlackRock’s ETF filing and CEO Larry Fink’s remarks about BTC.\n\nHe also aired his thoughts on the Ethereum/Bitcoin flippening debate, central bank digital currencies (CBCDs), global economy and government money printing before briefly offering his price prediction Solana . The macro guru also shared predictions for Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nSolana price prediction\n\nOn what he thought of the price performance of BTC, ETH and SOL in the next bull cycle, Pal shared a highly bullish projection for Ethereum’s “competitor.”\n\nCurrently, Solana trades around $21, about 1.4% down in the past 24 hours.\n\nHowever, the cryptocurrency is more than 10% in the green over the past seven days and 43% in the past 30 days. While it’s also down 43% from its value a year ago, Pal noted that the bottom might have come when prices fell to around $9 in December 2022.\n\nWith this outlook, Pal suggests SOL could do what ETH achieved after bottoming in 2018 – roaring to its all-time high above $4,800 during the last bull market. The macro guru says that if Solana takes on this projection, the potential gains could be staggering.\n\nHe compared the 47x that ETH saw after the 2018 low to what Solana could do. He opined:\n\n“Look… there’s a possibility – a dream scenario – that Solana does what ETH did from the 2018 low which was a 47x. The Solana low was nine bucks, so you could do the maths [and] the numbers are potentially very interesting.”\n\nWhile Solana’s price might not do the 47x or so that Ethereum price managed since its bottom in 2018, Pal predicts a “20 something x” move. According to him, this is a reasonable outlook for a protocol that’s battle-tested and is seeing a huge spike in network and ecosystem activity.\n\nShould Pal’s bullish outlook for SOL price hold, it would mean an eventual burst to prices above $400 for the cryptocurrency. In the last bull market, Solana rose to the all-time high at $260.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum price predictions\n\nFor BTC and ETH, Pal agreed with projections of a 3x and 5x respectively – suggesting Bitcoin could more than triple its value during the next bull cycle. However, that is from the all-time highs that was $69,000 in November 2021.\n\nTrippling from that ATH would mean a 6x from current prices, he opined. But that would depend on severa factors that could dictate market direction.\n\n“It’s very difficult to predict where it actually goes, but what we can say is [that] it’s reasonable that Bitcoin from all-time highs doubles or triples. That’s not asking a lot. That will be the worst bull market in Bitcoin’s history.”\n\nAccording to him, a potential supply crunch in 2023 is what could squeeze Bitcoin to a new all-time high.'}, {'id': 1, 'time': 'Mon, 10 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Sunland Park Mall gets new owner with plans for name change, upgrades - El Paso Times', 'content': 'Forget Sunland Park Mall.\n\nEl Paso’s second largest shopping center, which has lost most of its national retail tenants in recent years, will be renamed The Shoppes at Solana by its new owner – Enoch Kimmelman, owner of Starr Western Wear stores in El Paso.\n\nHe plans to update the mall’s main entrance and interior spaces, as well as recruit new stores, restaurants and entertainment-related tenants, he said.\n\nSolana, solarium in Spanish, was picked because the mall’s large skylights convey a sense of a solarium, Kimmelman said.\n\nHe completed the purchase last week of most of the mall from Ohio-based Washington Prime Group. The 35-year-old, 918,476-square-foot mall is located at Interstate 10 and Sunland Park Drive in West El Paso.\n\nThe purchase does not include the mall’s seven anchor tenant spaces, including two vacant ones where a Forever 21 and second Dillard’s were located. Dillard’s now has only one store in the mall.\n\nNo financial details were released, and Washington Prime officials declined to comment on the sale.\n\nKimmelman declined to say how much he’ll spend on upgrading the mall, which still looks good with its marble floors and huge skylights.\n\n“It’s pretty clear to me that the mall was being underutilized,” Kimmelman said. “And with the right amount of attention and a little bit of refurbishment, I think we can restore the mall to its glory days.”\n\nThe plan is to create a "Main Street feel" inside the mall with outdoorlike cafes and tenants that provide an experience, as well as retail shopping, he said.\n\nKimmelman owns and operates Starr Western Wear, which his parents started 60 years ago in Downtown El Paso, where it continues to operate a store.\n\nHe moved to Los Angeles 20 years ago, but regularly commutes to El Paso to oversee his business.\n\nIn 2018, Kimmelman bought the closed Macy’s Department Store building at Sunland Park Mall to open his third store, which has been performing well, he said.\n\nMore: Café Piro builds healthy menu on foundation of love, community, respect for ancestors\n\nThe mall has struggled in recent years to build a new tenant mix as its bread-and-butter, national retail tenants left.\n\nIt’s now anchored by Dillard\'s, Starr Western Wear, Conn\'s Home Plus, TruFit Athletic Clubs and Monkey Rock entertainment center.\n\nMonkey Rock, which opened in 2022, and a Jungle Reef aquarium, to be opened next year by Monkey Rock\'s owners, fit into Kimmelman\'s vision for more entertainment-tied tenants, he said.\n\nEven with its struggles, the mall still has lots of traffic during evenings and weekends, Kimmelman said.\n\nVictor Navarro, owner of The Shoe Doctor, a shoe repair and custom bootmaker that’s operated in the mall almost 30 years, said he hopes Kimmelman can pump new life into the shopping center.\n\n“It’s not like 15 to 20 years ago. There’s too many empty spaces,” Navarro said. “I hope he brings more business.”\n\nNavarro’s shop is tucked into a hidden corner of the mall, next to a now-shuttered entrance for the former Forever 21 store.\n\nWest Side resident Norma Garcia was at the mostly empty but cool mall on a scorching hot Monday afternoon. She goes there about twice a month, mostly to buy her 10-month-old grandson an ice cream and sometimes let him romp in a play area near the food court, which no longer has national food outlets.\n\n“It’s a really pretty mall,” Garcia said. “It used to be bursting with people, but now it’s a ghost town. Dillard’s is the only place I can shop now.”\n\nThe mall needs more stores, more restaurants, and more places for family activities, she said.\n\nA lot of spaces were taken in recent years by untraditional mall tenants, including a large barber college near the mall’s main entrance, and by local businesses.\n\nAbout 70 tenants are in the mall. However, the mall\'s directory has not been updated.\n\nThe previous owner, Washington Prime Group, filed for Chapter 11 reorganization bankruptcy in 2021, and didn’t have money for capital improvements, Kimmelman said. And that’s part of the reason the mall lost national retailers and other tenants, he believes. Many national retailers also have been struggling for a variety of reasons, including effects of the pandemic shutdowns, inflation and a slower economy.\n\n"I think that now that there\'ll be some capital improvements made to the mall, it will be a lot easier" to get the empty spaces leased, Kimmelman said.\n\nMore: Bitwise tech training company files for bankruptcy as workers seek unpaid wages\n\nPeter de Wetter, a partner at RJL Real Estate Consultants, an El Paso commercial real estate firm, said in an email that Kimmelman is a “sophisticated real estate investor and retail operator,” and logical buyer for the mall since he already owned his store\'s building there.\n\n“Having assisted Enoch with the sale and leasing of retail projects regionally over several years, we can attest to his ability to successfully lease and manage major projects,” de Wetter said. “We’re optimistic that Enoch’s long-term commitment to...'}]

In this volatile landscape, traders must possess a keen awareness of market trends and seize opportunities promptly to maximise their profits. Following the recent announcement of a bearish rating for Milady Meme Coin (LADYS), investors are increasingly exploring alternative options, particularly Big Eyes Coin (BIG) and Solana (SOL).\n\nThis comprehensive comparative article delves into the intricate nuances of these coins, meticulously examining their similarities and differences within the crypto trading industry. By immersing yourself in this detailed analysis, meme coin enthusiasts and investors will gain invaluable insights to inform their investment decisions.\n\nIs It Time To Let Milady Rest?\n\nMilady Meme Coin, symbolised as LADYS, gained initial popularity among meme coin enthusiasts due to its intriguing concept and catchy branding. However, recent developments have raised concerns within the crypto community, leading to a bearish rating on Wednesday. Investors who were initially attracted to Milady Meme Coin may now be considering alternative options.\n\nIn light of this recent bearish rating and uncertainties surrounding Milady Meme Coin, prudent traders should carefully assess their options. While the coin may still possess short-term speculative potential, it is crucial to consider alternative cryptocurrencies with stronger fundamentals and more promising growth prospects.\n\nDoes Solana’s 35% Price Rally Indicate Anything?\n\nSolana, often referred to as the Ethereum-killer in the crypto market, has experienced a significant price rally during the past three weeks. Within this timeframe, the price of SOL surged impressively, climbing from $14.84 to $20.23, granting holders substantial gains of over 35%.\n\nInterestingly, Santiment analysts discovered that on-chain metrics such as social dominance and development activity had no adverse impact on the price of SOL. Interestingly, the development activity observed on the SOL network is comparable to the levels witnessed in 2021, when the asset experienced a significant rally, reaching $250. In a recent report, Santiment analysts have suggested that holders of SOL pay close attention to a potential rally in the altcoin in the near future. As on-chain indicators slowly shift towards bullish territory and historical patterns reemerge, it’s essential for SOL holders to remain watchful.\n\nCan Big Eyes Coin Continue To Hook Investors’ Attention?\n\nBig Eyes Coin is a newly launched cryptocurrency combining meme coins’ appeal with practical utility. The project aims to revolutionise the meme coin market by introducing innovative developments, strategic partnerships, and community engagement. Its solid financial foundation, including an impressive presale worth approximately $50M, positions the project for exponential growth. Big Eyes Coin’s strategic roadmap spanning 24 months focuses on conquering ten additional exchanges and advancing its cutting-edge features.\n\nIn an effort to captivate investors, Big Eyes Coin has announced its plans to launch a crypto casino on August 29th. This groundbreaking venture will provide a vast array of over 4,000 casino games, catering to every gaming preference, including captivating play-to-earn (P2E) games. These strategic moves position Big Eyes Coin as a formidable player in the upcoming bull run, captivating the attention of crypto enthusiasts seeking innovative and entertaining investment avenues.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nIn the world of crypto trading, timing is crucial. As Milady Meme Coin receives a bearish rating, traders are wise to explore other options such as Big Eyes Coin and Solana. While Big Eyes originated from the meme coin realm, Big Eyes Coin has emerged as a serious contender, with a solid financial foundation, strategic partnerships, and a comprehensive roadmap for growth. Meme coin lovers and investors seeking meme coins with utility should consider the potential offered by Big Eyes Coin.\n\nTo make an informed decision, visit the Big Eyes Coin website today and discover how this remarkable digital asset can help you ride the wave of crypto trading success.

Compound, Solana\n\nMajor cryptocurrencies are trading with a modestly positive bias on Tuesday, but are still mostly within recent ranges ahead of Wednesday’s key US inflation data.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) was last trading up around 1% in the last 24 hours in the $30,600 area, while ether (ETH) was last around $1,870.\n\nPositive reporting in the crypto press regarding BlackRock’s spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) application could be acting as a mild tailwind for sentiment.\n\nReports allege that BlackRock’s application goes beyond the surveillance of spot trading to also include an agreement to share exchange user data with regulators, should they so request it.\n\nThis could further boost the likelihood that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approves the Wall Street giant’s ETF application.\n\nFor crypto investors keen to diversify their holdings away from blue-chip names like bitcoin and ether, here are some of the best coins to consider buying on Tuesday.\n\nMina Protocol (MINA)\n\nMINA, the native token that powers the zk-SNARKs-powered Mina Protocol blockchain, continues to trend to the downside within the confines of a bearish trend channel that has been in play since February.\n\nMINA/USD was last in the $0.45s, reversing back under its 21 and 50-Day Moving Averages after probing multi-week highs in the $0.52 area earlier in the session.\n\nWhilst MINA’s technical outlook remains bearish, if the cryptocurrency is able to break out of its bearish trendline, it could see substantial medium-term gains, hence why it could be a good crypto to buy.\n\nDeeLance (DLANCE)\n\nAn innovative new web3 project called DeeLance is building a crypto and NFT-powered metaverse that, in an industry first, puts the jobs market on the blockchain.\n\nThe project, which is touted as one of 2023’s hottest crypto start-ups, is building a metaverse to unite freelancers and employers and promises to overhaul remote working forever, as well as the $761 billion-dollar recruitment sector.\n\nUsing the decentralization and transparency of the blockchain, DeeLance wants to remove overly powerful middlemen like Fiverr and Upwork that have been abusing freelance workers and employers alike for the last decade.\n\nDeeLance is already generating huge hype in web3 circles and some observers think could upend the still very web2 platform-centric freelance/gig work economy.\n\nThe project has already raised a whopping near $1.5 million in just a few months since the launch of its $DLANCE token presale.\n\nDeeLance also recently secured a huge $1.12 million strategic investment from top venture capital firm Bitgert Ventures, a sign that institutions are increasingly taking note of the project’s potential.\n\nInvestors are encouraged to move quickly to secure tokens, as when the presale hits $1.7 million, the price will rise from its current super-cheap $0.038 level.\n\nGiven that DLANCE will debut on major cryptocurrency exchanges later this year at $0.57, investors who get in now can be sat on gains of around 50%.\n\nAdding to the excitement is a massive $500K $DLANCE token giveaway competition that DeeLance is conducting.\n\nThe top five wallets that buy the most $DLANCE between now and the end of presale stage four will be rewarded with a share of $500K worth of $DLANCE tokens.\n\n$DLANCE can be bought using ETH, BNB and USDT (the ERC-20 and BEP-20 variants).\n\nBuy DLANCE Here\n\nCompound (COMP)\n\nCompound (COMP), the token that powers the Compound Finance decentralized finance (DeFi) lending/borrowing protocol, is pumping again on Tuesday.\n\nCOMP was last up close to 10% on the session above $65 per token as the bulls eye a retest of yearly highs above $70.\n\nA break above this key resistance zone would open the door to a swift rally towards the next major resistance zone at $93, meaning near-term gains in the region of 40% are highly possible.\n\nWall Street Memes (WSM)\n\nWall Street Memes, one of the internet’s hottest retail investing communities, rose to prominence in the meme stock craze of 2021 and has recently been expanding its relevance in the cryptocurrency space with the presale of its new $WSM token.\n\nThe success of the $WSM presale, which has raised more than $14 million in just over one month, isn’t surprising given the size of Wall Street Memes’ community.\n\nNot only are there 523k hyper-engaged community members on its wallstbets Instagram account, there are another 214k on Twitter and more than 100k across its two other Instagram channels, wallstgonewild and wallstbullsnft.\n\nAll told, Wall Street Memes has a 1 million-strong social community of degens, which analysts think all but guarantees that the $WSM token will be listed on tier 1 crypto exchanges like Binance.\n\nWith 30% of the token supply being held back for community rewards, it can reasonably be expected that airdrops to holders will be a big part of the ecosystem.\n\nIndeed, the first $WSM airdrop is open now.\n\nAnalysts are already predicting big thing...'}]

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that there is a sell trend indicated by the MACD signal, suggesting a potential decrease in market activity and downward pressure on the price of ETH. This is further supported by the decrease in total transactions and successful transactions. The news analyst report, on the other hand, highlights positive developments in the cryptocurrency market, such as successful migrations to Ethereum and Solana's price recovery strategy. Additionally, collaborations in the renewable energy sector indicate growing interest and investment in sustainable energy solutions.

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a cautious and conservative approach based on a thorough analysis of both on-chain and news reports has been effective in maximizing profit and managing risk in the volatile ETH market. It is crucial to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains, especially in the face of conflicting market signals and uncertainties. Key trends to monitor include regulatory issues, market volatility, and opportunities in alternative cryptocurrencies like Solana and Render Token.

Considering the synthesized reports and the emphasis on long-term strategies, I would take a conservative approach and sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.3. This decision reflects a cautious stance in light of the potential downward pressure indicated by the on-chain analysis, while also considering the positive developments in the cryptocurrency market highlighted in the news report. By prioritizing long-term strategies and managing risk appropriately, I aim to safeguard capital and capitalize on clearer opportunities as they arise.
ACTION:
-0.3
DAILY RETURN:
-0.004421529598253038
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the short-term market trend for ETH is bearish due to decreasing trading activity, declining investor confidence, and a consistent sell signal from the MACD indicator. On the other hand, the news analyst report paints a cautiously optimistic picture of the overall cryptocurrency market, with potential for further gains if key resistance levels are breached.

Taking into account the reflection analyst report, which emphasizes a cautious and conservative approach based on thorough analysis, it is prudent to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains in the current volatile market environment. Given the conflicting signals from the on-chain and news reports, it is important to exercise caution and manage risk effectively.

Considering all the reports, the synthesized market trend for ETH appears to be cautiously optimistic in the long term, with potential for further gains if key resistance levels are surpassed. However, the short-term outlook remains bearish, indicating a need for a conservative trading approach.

Therefore, my trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.5, reflecting a cautious stance in light of the short-term bearish trend and the need to manage risk effectively in the current market conditions.
ACTION:
-0.5
DAILY RETURN:
-0.00048300309858717583
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the market trend for ETH is bearish in the short term due to the fluctuating open price, lower successful transactions, and the consistent sell signal from the MACD indicator. This indicates potential further price declines and suggests a cautious approach is necessary.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights positive sentiment towards Solana and the potential increase in demand for ETH and SOL in the cryptocurrency market. This could attract more investors and consumers, potentially leading to an increase in demand for both cryptocurrencies.

In reflection, a cautious and conservative approach based on thorough analysis has been effective in managing risk and maximizing profit in the volatile ETH market. Prioritizing long-term strategies over short-term gains has proven beneficial, especially in the face of conflicting market signals and uncertainties.

Considering the mixed outlook in the market, a conservative trading approach is warranted to safeguard capital and capitalize on clearer opportunities as they arise. Therefore, I would recommend a cautious approach and prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains.

Based on the synthesized reports and the emphasis on long-term strategies, I would take a conservative approach and decide to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.5 to manage risk appropriately in the current market conditions.

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the short-term market trend for ETH is bearish due to decreasing trading activity, declining investor confidence, and a consistent sell signal from the MACD indicator. On the other hand, the news analyst report paints a cautiously optimistic picture of the overall cryptocurrency market, with potential for further gains if key resistance levels are breached.

Taking into account the reflection analyst report, which emphasizes a cautious and conservative approach based on thorough analysis, it is prudent to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains in the current volatile market environment. Given the conflicting signals from the on-chain and news reports, it is important to exercise caution and manage risk effectively.

Considering all the reports, the synthesized market trend for ETH appears to be cautiously optimistic in the long term, with potential for further gains if key resistance levels are surpassed. However, the short-term outlook remains bearish, indicating a need for a conservative trading approach.

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the market trend for ETH is bearish in the short term due to the fluctuating open price, lower successful transactions, and the consistent sell signal from the MACD indicator. This indicates potential further price declines and suggests a cautious approach is necessary.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights positive sentiment towards Solana and the potential increase in demand for ETH and SOL in the cryptocurrency market. This could attract more investors and consumers, potentially leading to an increase in demand for both cryptocurrencies.

In reflection, a cautious and conservative approach based on thorough analysis has been effective in managing risk and maximizing profit in the volatile ETH market. Prioritizing long-term strategies over short-term gains has proven beneficial, especially in the face of conflicting market signals and uncertainties.

Considering the mixed outlook in the market, a conservative trading approach is warranted to safeguard capital and capitalize on clearer opportunities as they arise. Therefore, I would recommend a cautious approach and prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains.

Based on the synthesized reports and the emphasis on long-term strategies, I would take a conservative approach and decide to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.5 to manage risk appropriately in the current market conditions.

The successful transactions have also been declining, indicating a decrease in overall market activity. The MACD signal consistently showing a sell indication further supports the bearish trend.

It is currently worth around $22.04 on the market, up 5.58% over the last 24 hours. The asset’s performance may not be Olympic, but it could be much better.\n\nAt least, that’s what Raoul Pal has in mind. Indeed, the CEO of Real Vision is particularly optimistic about the crypto’s price prospects. According to his forecasts, it could reach 20 times its current price, or around $440.\n\nGiven current market conditions, this seems a surreal projection. If Raoul Pal believes it, it’s for a number of reasons. In particular, he notes that Solana has gained around 10% in valuation over the past week.\n\nThis represents around 43% over the last 30 days. In other words, the signals are favorable for Solana. At least, enough, the analyst believes, for the crypto to replicate a similar dynamic achieved by Ethereum (ETH) in 2018.\n\nAfter bottoming out that year, the crypto had accomplished a surge taking it to over $4,800. This breakthrough represented just over 47 times the asset’s lowest value.\n\nIt’s not certain that Solana will make a similar move. Nevertheless, Raoul Pal believes that the crypto is following in ETH’s footsteps. A trend confirmed by its fall to $9 in 2022, its lowest level.\n\n“Look… There’s a possibility that Solana will do what ETH did from the 2018 low, which was a 47x.

The news articles suggest a positive sentiment towards cryptocurrencies, particularly Solana (SOL) and XRP, with predictions of significant price increases. Solana is expected to reach 20 times its current price, while XRP has seen a 62% increase following a ruling that it is not a security in certain contexts. Additionally, Ethereum (ETH) is mentioned in relation to its ESG ranking and positive market conditions. Overall, the market trend appears to be bullish for these cryptocurrencies, with potential for further growth and increased investor interest, especially with the focus on ESG and regulatory clarity.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the market trend for ETH is bearish in the short term due to the fluctuating open price, lower successful transactions, and the consistent sell signal from the MACD indicator. This indicates potential further price declines and suggests a cautious approach is necessary.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights positive sentiment towards Solana and the potential increase in demand for ETH and SOL in the cryptocurrency market. This could attract more investors and consumers, potentially leading to an increase in demand for both cryptocurrencies.

In reflection, a cautious and conservative approach based on thorough analysis has been effective in managing risk and maximizing profit in the volatile ETH market. Prioritizing long-term strategies over short-term gains has proven beneficial, especially in the face of conflicting market signals and uncertainties.

Considering the mixed outlook in the market, a conservative trading approach is warranted to safeguard capital and capitalize on clearer opportunities as they arise. Therefore, I would recommend a cautious approach and prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains.

Based on the synthesized reports and the emphasis on long-term strategies, I would take a conservative approach and decide to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.5 to manage risk appropriately in the current market conditions.
ACTION:

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that there is a bearish sentiment in the market for ETH due to fluctuating open prices and the macd_signal indicating a sell trend. The news analyst report, on the other hand, paints a more positive picture of the overall cryptocurrency market, with gains seen in various cryptocurrencies and innovative developments in the blockchain space. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a cautious and conservative approach, prioritizing long-term strategies over short-term gains.

Considering the conflicting signals from the on-chain and news reports, it is crucial to take a conservative approach and prioritize long-term strategies. While short-term selling strategies may be considered in the current bearish market sentiment for ETH, it is important to focus on managing risk effectively and safeguarding capital for clearer opportunities that may arise in the future.

Therefore, I would recommend taking a conservative approach and holding onto ETH for the long term, with a trading action confidence level of 0.3. This reflects a moderate level of confidence in the market trend and the strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.

After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that ETH is currently experiencing a bearish trend with decreasing open prices, total transactions, and successful transactions. The MACD signal consistently showing a sell indication further supports this downward trend. On the other hand, the news analyst report suggests a bullish sentiment towards cryptocurrencies like Solana and XRP, with potential for significant price increases. Ethereum is also mentioned positively in relation to its ESG ranking and market conditions.

In light of these conflicting signals, it is important to prioritize a cautious and conservative approach to trading. Long-term strategies should be favored over short-term gains to effectively manage risk and maximize profit in the volatile cryptocurrency market. While the news analyst report may indicate short-term bullish potential for ETH, the on-chain analysis suggests a more bearish outlook in the near future.

Let’s examine the implications of Ripple’s victory for these tokens.\n\nRipple Wins SEC After Three Years\n\nIn December 2020, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs and its founders, Brad Garlinghouse and Christian Larsen, alleging that the company and its executives conducted an unregistered securities offering through the sale of XRP.\n\nThe SEC argued that XRP should be classified as a security, placing it under the agency’s regulatory purview. However, Ripple boldly refuted the allegations and mounted a robust legal defense.\n\nOn July 13, 2023, after nearly three years of intense legal battle, Ripple scored a landmark victory as Judge Analisa Torres, presiding over the case, ruled that most of the tokens in XRP sales do not constitute securities transactions.\n\nWhat Does Ripple’s Win Mean for Other Tokens?\n\nThe ruling has far-reaching implications for the broader crypto ecosystem, especially for tokens like SOL, ADA, MATIC, and others that have faced similar allegations from the SEC.\n\nRecall that the agency claimed that at least 12 tokens, including Binance Coin (BNB), Binance USD (BUSD), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), Filecoin (FIL), Cosmos Hub (ATOM), The Sandbox (SAND), Decentraland (MANA), Algorand (ALGO), Axie Infinity (AXS), and COTI (COTI), are securities in its lawsuits against leading crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase.\n\nHowever, the outcome of the Ripple-SEC case could have a ripple effect (pun intended) on these tokens facing scrutiny. These projects might draw inspiration from Ripple’s successful defense strategy. They may be motivated to challenge regulatory allegations, potentially strengthening their positions and asserting their tokens’ non-security status.\n\nFurthermore, Ripple’s legal triumph could pave the way for increased clarity and regulatory certainty in the industry. Judge Torres’ ruling could provide a legal precedent that helps establish a clearer framework for distinguishing between securities and non-securities in the digital asset space. This would thus benefit other tokens that have been grappling with regulatory uncertainty.\n\nMeanwhile, Ripple’s win over the SEC is undoubtedly a positive development for the entire crypto industry. However, this does not mean that regulatory scrutiny will dissipate entirely. The agency will likely continue scrutinizing other tokens and projects for potential securities violations.\n\nNonetheless, the Ripple case could prompt regulators to refine their approach, conduct more nuanced investigations, and provide clearer guidelines for token issuers to ensure compliance.'}, {'id': 8, 'time': 'Sat, 15 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'BREAKING: BinanceUS Halts Trading for Bitcoin (BTC), Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), Solana (SOL), Litecoin (LTC), and 4 other Prominent Cryptocurrencies - Crypto News Flash', 'content': 'Binance.US announced its decision to discontinue and cease trading for certain USD Advanced Trading pairs.\n\nBinanceUS stated that users can now deposit XRP since they have listed it on their platform.\n\nOn Friday, Binance.US, the United States-based branch of the largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance, announced its decision to discontinue and cease trading for certain USD Advanced Trading pairs. This action is part of the exchange’s transition towards becoming a “crypto-only exchange,” where it will exclusively support trading between cryptocurrencies and stablecoin pairs while eliminating trading against the US dollar.\n\nIn an official statement released on July 14, Binance.US, a cryptocurrency exchange, confirmed that it will permanently remove and discontinue trading for various cryptocurrencies paired against USD in advanced trading.

However, this delisting was specific to Binance US and did not impact the broader Binance crypto exchange, which continued to support XRP trading. Following Ripple’s recent legal triumph in its three-year legal battle against the SEC, XRP is making a comeback on exchanges where it had previously been delisted.\n\nStreamlining USD Withdrawals\n\nDespite encountering several challenges in the U.S., such as the loss of banking partners and revenue streams, BinanceUS still allows users to engage in various activities, including buying, selling, and converting cryptocurrencies with USD. Additionally, users can utilize USD to trade 21 different cryptocurrencies. However, Binance US cautioned that its remaining partners may discontinue USD withdrawal services.\n\nTaking steps to address the issue, on June 23, Binance US collaborated with its banking partners to resolve all delayed USD withdrawal requests. As a result, the crypto exchange now aims to process most USD withdrawal requests within the standard timeframe of 5 business days or less.'}]

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the market trend for ETH is bearish, with fluctuating open prices and a consistent sell signal from the MACD indicator. The news analyst report highlights a cautiously optimistic outlook for SOL in the short term, but advises thorough analysis due to its price decline over the past year. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a conservative and long-term trading approach in managing risk effectively in the volatile cryptocurrency market.

Considering the information from all three reports, it is evident that a cautious and conservative trading strategy is warranted. While short-term gains may be tempting, prioritizing long-term strategies and risk management is crucial in maximizing profit and navigating market uncertainties.

Therefore, I would recommend taking a conservative approach and holding onto ETH for the long term. My trading action would be to buy ETH with a confidence level of 0.5, indicating a moderate level of confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.
ACTION:
0.5
DAILY RETURN:
0.12103611154561356
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that ETH is currently experiencing a bearish trend with decreasing open prices, total transactions, and successful transactions. The MACD signal consistently showing a sell indication further supports this downward trend. On the other hand, the news analyst report suggests a bullish sentiment towards cryptocurrencies like Solana and XRP, with potential for significant price increases. Ethereum is also mentioned positively in relation to its ESG ranking and market conditions.

In light of these conflicting signals, it is important to prioritize a cautious and conservative approach to trading. Long-term strategies should be favored over short-term gains to effectively manage risk and maximize profit in the volatile cryptocurrency market. While the news analyst report may indicate short-term bullish potential for ETH, the on-chain analysis suggests a more bearish outlook in the near future.

Therefore, considering the need for risk management and the importance of long-term strategies, I would take a conservative approach and lean towards selling ETH in the current market conditions. My trading action would be -0.5, reflecting my moderate confidence in the bearish trend and my strategic decision to safeguard capital and capitalize on clearer opportunities as they arise.
ACTION:
-0.5
DAILY RETURN:
0.008158070317354271
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently bearish, with a downward trend in open prices and a sell indication from the MACD signal. The increase in total transactions without a significant rise in successful transactions also suggests potential selling pressure.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights mixed market trends for ETH, with regulatory issues impacting market sentiment and the emergence of bSOL tokens potentially boosting liquidity in the DeFi space. The warning on Litecoin and positive outlook on Solana indicate potential volatility in the altcoin market.

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a cautious and conservative approach is more successful in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. Long-term strategies should be prioritized over short-term gains to manage risk effectively and maximize profit.

Considering the synthesized reports, the market trend for ETH is likely to continue being bearish in the near future, influenced by regulatory developments and DeFi activities. Therefore, a conservative trading approach is warranted to safeguard capital and capitalize on clearer opportunities as they arise.

Given the bearish market trend and the need for a conservative approach, I would take a trading action with a confidence level of -0.7, indicating a moderate level of confidence in the bearish trend and my strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.

Placeholder, each bear market, tends to pick an ecosystem or two and build an aircraft carrier strategy around that ecosystem. And so the last bear [market], it was ETH and Bitcoin, because those were really the only things at scale and liquid enough to justify.\n\nAnd what I mean by aircraft carrier – if you take Ethereum, buy a bunch of the core ETH asset, but then venture invest around it and really get to know that ecosystem and who all the people are that are working on say, at that point in time, lending or DEXs [decentralized exchanges] or asset management or whatever. And then you can pick the best teams of the teams that most speak to you from a venture perspective.

2023 - Cryptonews', 'content': '10 Meme Coin Price Predictions for 2023\n\nMeme coin logos / Source: Adobe\n\n2023 has been a blockbuster year for blue-chip cryptocurrencies.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is up a staggering 80% year-to-date.\n\nEther (ETH) is up 58% over the same time period.\n\nBut the picture has been more mixed for meme coins.\n\nSome have done very well, but others have struggled, suggesting risk appetite remains cautious and animal spirits are yet to fully return to the crypto space, despite the strong performance of the major coins.\n\nLet’s have a look at the outlook for some of the top tokens with 10 meme coin price predictions for 2023.\n\nWall Street Memes (WSM)\n\nWall Street Memes, one of the internet’s hottest retail investing communities, rose to prominence in the meme stock craze of 2021 and has recently been expanding its relevance in the cryptocurrency space with the presale of its new $WSM token.\n\nThe success of the $WSM presale, which has raised $14.5 million in just over one month, isn’t surprising given the size of Wall Street Memes’ community.\n\nNot only are there 523k hyper-engaged community members on its wallstbets Instagram account, there are another 214k on Twitter and more than 100k across its two other Instagram channels, wallstgonewild and wallstbullsnft.\n\nAll told, Wall Street Memes has a 1 million-strong social community of degens, which analysts think all but guarantees that the $WSM token will be listed on tier 1 crypto exchanges like Binance.\n\nWith 30% of the token supply being held back for community rewards, it can reasonably be expected that airdrops to holders will be a big part of the ecosystem.\n\nIndeed, the first $WSM airdrop is open now.\n\nAnalysts are already predicting big things for Wall Street Memes when it lists on exchanges and you can be a part of it.\n\nVisit Wall Street Memes Here\n\nThug Life Token (THUG)\n\nUpdate – The $THUG presale has now sold out, with its listing set to take place on July 17.\n\nDespite only launching just over a week ago, brand new meme coin project Thug Life Token has already been able to raise more than $1.58 million via the presale of its $THUG token.\n\nVarious industry observers have tipped $THUG to be a major success given the refreshing take it brings to the meme coin space.\n\n$THUG is not based around out-of-fashion dog memes or short-term social media fads, like meme coins created in response to Elon Musk or Andrew Tate tweets.\n\nRather, $THUG is themed around the timeless Thug Life movement that was first popularized by hip hop stars such as Snoop Dogg back in the 80s.\n\nAs the word of $THUG spreads, more degens are expected to pile cash into the project.\n\nThat’s because Thug Life Token has all of the makings of the next 100x meme coin.\n\nAt the presale price of $0.0007 and total maximum supply of 4.2 billion, the Thug Life Token presale only values the coin at a very conservative $2.94 million fully diluted market cap.\n\nThat’s much smaller than most other comparable presale projects and the low presale market cap leaves plenty of room for explosive upside.\n\nMeme coin degens have no time to lose when it comes to getting involved in the project early.\n\nThat’s because the $THUG presale will end once the $2.058 million mark is hit, or when the 3-day countdown runs out (whichever comes first).\n\nAfter that, the only way to secure $THUG tokens will be via the project’s airdrop and community rewards campaign or at a potentially elevated price on major decentralized exchanges (DEXs).\n\nVisit Thug Life Token Here\n\nDogecoin (DOGE)\n\nDespite the fact that blue chip cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have recently been probing for fresh yearly highs, the outlook for the crypto market’s biggest meme coin remains bearish.\n\nDogecoin has remained stuck below most of its major moving averages and below a downtrend from the 2021 record highs.\n\nHype that Elon Musk might integrate Dogecoin somehow into a future Twitter payments system has pretty much petered out.\n\nDogecoin faces significant resistance in the $0.075 area and could fall back to yearly lows around $0.05 before the end of 2023.\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB)\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB), the second largest meme coin by market cap and a copycat version of Dogecoin, has a slightly better near-term technical outlook.\n\nIt recently broke above a medium-term downtrend and if it can hold above its 21 and 50-Day Moving Averages, a pushback above $0.0000084 resistance and back towards $0.000010 is on the cards before the end of 2023.\n\nPepe (PEPE)\n\nPepe Coin is 2023’s biggest meme coin success.\n\nThe meme coin, which is based on the timeless Pepe the Frog internet meme, exploded onto the scene in April.\n\nPEPE saw its market cap top out around $1.8 billion in May, but has since been able to hold onto a market cap of around $600 million.\n\nImpressive stuff.\n\nPepe has proven its power, even with the broader crypto market isn’t exactly in a super exciting bull market.\n\nWhen blue-chip cryptos like bitcoin and ether really get going, Pepe could fly back to all-time highs in 2023.\n\nFloki

Blockchain and crypto since many years. He has previous trading experience and has been working in the Fintech industry since 2017.\n\nQadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nWhat if you could use your Bitcoin on the Ethereum blockchain, or your Ethereum on the Solana blockchain? That’s where wrapped tokens come in. They’re like undercover agents, disguised as tokens from one blockchain but actually representing tokens from another. This allows you to use your favorite tokens on any blockchain that supports them! Perfect, right?\n\nPegged tokens, on the other hand, are like anchors in the stormy seas of cryptocurrency. They’re designed to maintain a stable value, typically by being pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. This makes them a good option for those who are looking for a more stable investment.\n\nTogether, wrapped and pegged tokens make the crypto world a more interconnected and user-friendly place. They allow you to move your assets between different blockchains and to invest in tokens that are less volatile than others.\n\nSo, if you’re looking to get the most out of the crypto world, be sure to familiarize yourself with wrapped and pegged tokens. And for that, this article is all you need!\n\nKey Takeaways Wrapped tokens address the issues of interoperability, cross-chain transactions and wider acceptance of the DeFi system.Pegged tokens ensure price stability in the highly volatile crypto market.Wrapped BTC is the 23rd largest cryptocurrency in the crypto sphere.In the latest news, Tether lost 1:1 to USD amid heightened sell pressure in Curve’s 3Pool. Read here to know more about USDC Vs. USDT ongoing updates.\n\n1.1. The Journey of Token Evolution\n\nThe evolution of tokens is an intriguing story in the world of cryptocurrency. It all began with the inception of Bitcoin, the pioneer of digital currencies. However, as technology advanced, the need for more sophisticated token types emerged.\n\nWrapped Tokens: The introduction of wrapped tokens marked a significant milestone. These tokens were designed to bridge the gap between different blockchains. Initially, most decentralized projects operated on the Ethereum blockchain, creating complexities when dealing with tokens like Bitcoin, which had its blockchain. Wrapped tokens resolved this by allowing token holders to seamlessly interact with various token ecosystems. This innovation gave birth to a new era of token systems.\n\nPegged Tokens: Another pivotal development was the creation of pegged tokens, which addressed a prominent issue in the cryptocurrency realm – price volatility. The crypto market’s wild price swings posed challenges for stable transactions. In response, stablecoins were introduced. These coins are tethered to relatively stable assets like the US Dollar, providing a dependable value. Wrapped and pegged tokens are the cornerstones of crypto innovation, enhancing the adaptability and versatility of digital currencies.\n\n1.2. Interoperability and Stability in Tokens?\n\nInteroperability and stability are fundamental concepts in the world of wrapped and pegged tokens. Let’s delve into what these terms mean:\n\nInteroperability is the ability of different blockchains and related tokens to work with each other without any obstacle. We know that blockchain networks have their own protocols and regulations. However, if we wish to tap the most out of this technology, blockchains shall not limit to their own ecosystems by allowing them to work with other networks too. Interoperable tokens make this situation possible! They can “operate” with varied blockchains. It is very vital for adopting blockchain technology for a wider and more efficient use. Therefore, “interoperability” is a key role player in deriving the most out of the vast blockchain ecosystems.\n\nStability refers to the value of the tokens. Known for the extremely volatile space, the cryptocurrency world was in dire need of stable tokens which could maintain a constant value over a period of time. Stablecoins have majorly helped in this sector! They are pegged to stable assets’ values to minimize price volatility.\n\nThis is why interoperability and stability are salient features of the new crypto world!\n\n1. What are Wrapped Tokens?\n\nWe would like to take you through an example here! Suppose you have a box which can only hold specific coloured balls, that is, black. This box is like a blockchain which can only handle a specific kind of token such as an Ethereum-based token. You wish to put white coloured balls in the box but it cannot hold it due to its specification. Then, you need to wrap the balls with black paper in order to fit in! This wrapped ball is like a wrapped token. It represents the original white ball transformed into black to get ins...'}]

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that ETH is currently experiencing a bearish trend with decreasing open prices, total transactions, and successful transactions. The MACD signal consistently showing a sell indication further supports this downward trend. On the other hand, the news analyst report suggests a bullish sentiment towards cryptocurrencies like Solana and XRP, with potential for significant price increases. Ethereum is also mentioned positively in relation to its ESG ranking and market conditions.

In light of these conflicting signals, it is important to prioritize a cautious and conservative approach to trading. Long-term strategies should be favored over short-term gains to effectively manage risk and maximize profit in the volatile cryptocurrency market. While the news analyst report may indicate short-term bullish potential for ETH, the on-chain analysis suggests a more bearish outlook in the near future.

Therefore, considering the need for risk management and the importance of long-term strategies, I would take a conservative approach and lean towards selling ETH in the current market conditions. My trading action would be -0.5, reflecting my moderate confidence in the bearish trend and my strategic decision to safeguard capital and capitalize on clearer opportunities as they arise.

REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently bearish, with a downward trend in open prices and a sell indication from the MACD signal. The increase in total transactions without a significant rise in successful transactions also suggests potential selling pressure.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights mixed market trends for ETH, with regulatory issues impacting market sentiment and the emergence of bSOL tokens potentially boosting liquidity in the DeFi space. The warning on Litecoin and positive outlook on Solana indicate potential volatility in the altcoin market.

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a cautious and conservative approach is more successful in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. Long-term strategies should be prioritized over short-term gains to manage risk effectively and maximize profit.

Considering the synthesized reports, the market trend for ETH is likely to continue being bearish in the near future, influenced by regulatory developments and DeFi activities. Therefore, a conservative trading approach is warranted to safeguard capital and capitalize on clearer opportunities as they arise.

Given the bearish market trend and the need for a conservative approach, I would take a trading action with a confidence level of -0.7, indicating a moderate level of confidence in the bearish trend and my strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.

SOL has turned the $26 level into support, and so long as this level holds, this cryptocurrency has a clear path higher.\n\nBuying Volume Exploded\n\nLast week’s buy pressure exceeded any expectation with levels not seen since the start of 2023. This impressive interest from buyers rapidly translated into a higher price. The volume has decreased somewhat compared to last week, but buyers continue to be present.\n\n3. RSI is Overbought\n\nThe daily RSI is giving a clear signal that Solana may have reached a local top right now after hitting 82 points. This means a pullback is likely on lower timeframes, and buyers have to do their best to stop sellers at the key support.\n\nBias\n\nThe bias for SOL is bullish.\n\nShort-Term Prediction for SOL Price\n\nThe price action remains bullish for Solana, and momentum is favoring buyers. Nevertheless, a short-lived pullback could take place before the price attempts to break the key resistance at $33.

In each RHNA cycle, the state assigns each region a number of new housing units that must be accommodated over the next eight years.\n\n“In recognition that San Diego County is failing to provide enough housing for its current and future citizens,” the report read, “the Grand Jury decided to look at the failure of the cities and County to meet their Regional Housing Needs Allocation goals and evaluate steps that could be taken to increase the regional housing stock.”\n\nThe report also noted that the housing crisis is “driving people to leave California or to move outside of San Diego County to lower cost areas of the state.”\n\nCity government leaders, who often want more local control over zoning, and state government officials, who have been overriding local zoning in an effort to create more housing to address the statewide crisis, have been at odds over the potential solutions — including the RHNA process.\n\nSolana Beach was one of the cities in San Diego County that unsuccessfully tried to fight its assigned number of new housing units for the sixth-cycle RHNA, which runs from 2021 to 2029, through an appeal to SANDAG and a lawsuit. The San Diego Association of Governments, or SANDAG, used a methodology that distributed about 171,000 housing units that the state assigned to San Diego County near job centers and transit. Solana Beach ended up with 875.\n\nSolana Beach City Council members accepted the report on the fifth-cycle RHNA during their July 12 meeting. Each city is required to respond to the findings and recommendations.\n\nIn Solana Beach’s response, the city noted that local zoning had been updated to accommodate 340 units across all income levels, which was the city’s allocation for the fifth cycle. But there weren’t enough units constructed in any of those income categories — very low, low, moderate and above moderate.\n\n“The development of these units is dependent upon market trends, funding, available land and economic feasibility as determined by property owners and the development community,” the city’s response read. “While the City agrees with the finding that the amount of development that occurred does not reflect the housing need allocation, the City implemented programs and policies that supported and encourage new housing development. Absent a dependable source of revenue dedicated expressly to the development of housing, local government throughout the state will continue to fall short of meeting their respective housing goals.”\n\nRecommendations included working with school districts and religious institutions to add housing. The Solana Beach response said that the city “is unaware of any school properties within its jurisdiction that would be available for housing development,” and that two sites owned by local churches are already included in the sixth-cycle RHNA process.\n\nOne of the recommendations also encouraged the city to support the reintroduction of SB 1105, which would have created a San Diego agency that provides funding for affordable housing.\n\n“Solana Beach will continue to monitor and evaluate proposed legislation that would provide funding for development of affordable housing,” the city responded.'}, {'id': 2, 'time': 'Mon, 17 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Trending Coins You Should Buy for 100x Gains: Solana, Tradecurve, and Aave - Hindustan Times', 'content': "Solana (SOL), Aave (AAVE), and Tradecurve (TCRV) are the three trending coins that captured the attention of the crypto community.

The coin can potentially deliver substantial gains with continued adoption and developments within the Solana ecosystem.\n\nAave (AAVE): Revolutionizing Decentralized Lending\n\nAave (AAVE), a decentralized lending platform built on Ethereum, has gained popularity due to its innovative approach to borrowing and lending in decentralized finance. The platform Aave enables users to lend or borrow various cryptocurrencies without intermediaries, creating a transparent and efficient lending ecosystem.\n\nIn recent developments, the decision to convert 1,600 ETH, or $3 million, into the wrapped staked ether (wstETH) and rocket pool Ether (ETH) is being voted on by Aave (AAVE) token holders as part of a governance process. Aave could make 3.8% by staking wstETH and 3.13% by staking rETH after the conversion.\n\nThe strong fundamentals and growing adoption within the DeFi sector of Aave have propelled its price upward as it trades hands at $70.47 with a market cap of $1B.

After reviewing the reports from the on-chain analyst, news analyst, and reflection analyst, it is clear that the overall sentiment in the market is cautious and mixed. The on-chain analyst report indicates a bearish trend for ETH with no clear indication of a significant increase in trading activity. The news analyst report highlights positive momentum for Solana and Aave, while Ethereum is experiencing a minor decline. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a cautious and conservative approach in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market.

Taking into consideration the bearish trend for ETH, the positive momentum for Solana and Aave, and the importance of long-term strategies in managing risk, it is advisable to prioritize a conservative trading approach. Short-term gains may lead to losses in the current market environment, and it is crucial to focus on long-term strategies to capitalize on clearer opportunities as they arise.

Therefore, my trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.7. This decision reflects my cautious approach towards the bearish trend in the market and my strategic decision to manage risk appropriately by prioritizing long-term strategies over short-term gains.

This integration opens up the opportunity for Ethereum developers to effortlessly deploy their projects on the Solana network.\n\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a program that enables developers to create smart contract-enabled decentralized applications (dApps) and deploy them on compatible platforms. Previously, without an EVM, projects seeking to deploy Ethereum-based applications on other blockchains had to modify the code to suit the new ecosystem.\n\nNeon EVM offers a solution that bridges the gap between the Ethereum and Solana networks, representing the first-of-its-kind development on the Solana mainnet. The Neon Labs team emphasized that the necessary tools are now available for Ethereum developers to utilize.\n\nTransitioning to the Solana network presents several benefits for Ethereum-based dApps, including reduced operational costs and the advantage of parallel transaction execution on Solana.\n\nNeon Labs is optimistic that their EVM solution will seamlessly integrate with Solana’s high throughput capabilities. However, the claim of Solana being the fastest EVM-compatible blockchain remains a topic of debate among industry participants, as Neon EVM undergoes extensive testing.\n\nMaina Guryeva, the director of Neon Foundation, expressed excitement over the Neon EVM’s launch on Solana Mainnet. She revealed that real-world data gathered during production tests will be presented to showcase its performance.\n\nInitially scheduled for deployment in December 2022 by the Neon Foundation, the EVM solution faced delays due to challenging market conditions at the time. The new deployment date remained undisclosed until now. With the mainnet launch finally realized, popular Ethereum-based projects like Aave and Curve Finance are expected to make their entry into the Solana ecosystem through the Neon EVM.'}, {'id': 7, 'time': 'Tue, 18 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Gonzalez family reunites in La Colonia neighborhood more than 100 years after their ancestors settled there - Del Mar Times', 'content': 'About 100 years ago, several Mexican families built their homes and made a community in what came to be known as La Colonia de Eden Gardens.\n\nMore than 300 relatives from one of those families, the Gonzalez family, came together on July 8 for their first-ever family reunion, which included live music, activities, presentations, and an address by Solana Beach Mayor Lesa Heebner. A lot has changed since their ancestors first settled in the neighborhood, which later became part of the city of Solana Beach, but the family wanted to make sure the history and family bonds remain intact.\n\n“It was critical for us to tell the family story,” said Lisa Montes, a fourth-generation resident of La Colonia. “Because if we don’t tell the family story, the story will get lost.”\n\nMany of the founders of La Colonia were farm workers who worked in nearby communities, picking tomatoes, lima beans, citrus fruit. But racist land-use policies prevented them from living in those same places.\n\nThe Gonzalez family legacy is tied to some of La Colonia’s best known landmarks, including Tony’s Jacal (a restaurant started by Antonio and Catalina Gonzalez) and St. Leo Mission (which achieved mission status with advocacy from Cipriana Gonzalez). They also later became philanthropists, providing scholarships to Latino students in the San Dieguito area, sponsored youth and adult sports teams, and more.\n\nIn addition, Montes said members of the family served in the various armed forces in Korea, Vietnam and Operation Desert Storm.\n\nMaintaining their culture still had its challenges. At one point there was an Americanization school where students were punished for speaking Spanish. In recent years, gentrification has been reshaping the community with skyrocketing land values near the coast. Some of the longtime Mexican residents have sold their homes, and rising rents and home prices put the neighborhood out of reach for many in the younger generations.\n\nSome of the traditions that continue to honor the history of La Colonia include the annual Dia de los Muertos celebration in La Colonia Park. There was also a centennial celebration for La Colonia in 2021, delayed one year because of the pandemic.\n\nDaniel Ramirez, who attended the reunion, said his father moved the family from La Colonia to Corona to start working in construction. But Solana Beach was always a summer destination to see cousins and other relatives.\n\nFamily members wore buttons at the reunion to show which branch of the family tree they’re on, since it has grown to include Huizar, Sanchez and several other last names in addition to Gonzalez.\n\n“It was an opportunity for folks who didn’t know each other to meet, or folks who hadn’t seen each other in decades to renew ties,” said Ramirez, an associate professor of religion at Claremont Graduate University. “I think, most importantly, to root the younger generations in a sense of history and identity that’s going to provide an anchor for their lives ahead.”'}, {'id': 2, 'time': 'Tue, 18 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'TMS Network (TMSN) Innovations Bring Hope To Crypto Over Solana (SOL) and Aptos (APT) - Coin Rivet', 'content': 'Buy and sell Bitcoin the easy way Start your crypto portfolio today! Get started\n\nNew innovations and projects are continually developing in the ever-changing world of cryptocurrencies. TMS Network (TMSN) is one such innovation, offering hope and promising to change the crypto market. As TMS Network penetrates the crypto space, Solana (SOL) and Aptos (APT) continue to underperform, upsetting token holders who once had strong hopes for them.\n\nSolana (SOL) and Aptos (APT) Face Competition from TMS Network (TMSN):\n\nSolana (SOL) and Aptos (APT), once prominent cryptocurrencies, are now facing increased competition from the innovative TMS Network. SOL, known for its high-performance blockchain and scalability, has encountered issues like network congestion and rising transaction costs. These concerns have led to uncertainties among investors, making them explore alternatives. On the other hand, Aptos (APT) has struggled to gain widespread adoption and attract significant user attention despite its potential.\n\nSolana (SOL) and Aptos (APT) have both been significant players in the cryptocurrency market. Solana (SOL) gained attention for its high-performance blockchain, offering fast transaction speeds and scalability. It aimed to address the scalability issues other blockchain networks, such as Ethereum (ETH), face and positioned itself as a platform for decentralized applications (dApps) and DeFi projects. However, Solana (SOL) has faced its share of obstacles.\n\nOne of the significant challenges Solana (SOL) has encountered is network congestion. As the network’s popularity increased, the transaction volume surged, resulting in congestion and slower transaction processing times. This congestion led to higher transaction costs, diminishing the cost-effectiveness that Solana (SOL) initially promised. These issues have raised concerns among investors and users. This has led them to explore alternative options that offer similar benefits without the scalability and congestion challenges.\n\nAptos (APT), on the other hand, has struggled to gain adoption despite its potential. The project aimed to provide a decentralized payment solution catering to various industries and sectors. However, it has faced difficulties capturing users’ and investors’ attention and trust. The lack of significant user attention can be attributed to factors such as limited marketing efforts, a lack of partnerships, or a competitive landscape.\n\nWith the emergence of TMS Network (TMSN), Solana (SOL) and Aptos (APT) now face increased competition. TMS Network introduces a decentralized trading platform offering various innovative features and benefits for traders. It presents a user-friendly and inclusive trading experience that addresses the challenges traders face, such as price manipulation, high trading fees, and a lack of trading education.\n\nTMS Network’s advanced features, including its trading terminal, social trading infrastructure, strategy builder, on-chain analytics, and compatibility with MT4 and MT5 platforms, offer a comprehensive solution for traders looking for a seamless and enjoyable trading experience. These features give TMS Network (TMSN) a competitive edge over Solana (SOL) and Aptos (APT), as they directly address the pain points and limitations experienced by traders on other platforms.\n\nMoreover, TMS Network’s revenue-sharing model, where TMS token holders earn commissions from trading volume across the platform, adds another layer of attractiveness for traders and investors. This revenue-sharing opportunity incentivizes token holders and fosters a sense of community and ownership, distinguishing TMS Network from Solana (SOL) and Aptos (APT).\n\nTMS Network (TMSN): A New Era for Crypto Investors:\n\nTMS Network (TMSN) introduces a new era for crypto investors by revolutionizing the trading industry. This Ethereum-based decentralized platform allows users to trade all derivatives via cryptocurrency payments, eliminating the need for traditional fiat currency. With instant transaction processing and a seamless trading experience, TMS Network offers convenience and efficiency to traders.\n\nTMSN’s strong utility value has made it a new favorite among investors looking for huge returns in 2023. The platform’s presale campaign has been one of the most successful, outperforming similar campaigns and the entire crypto market. After launch, TMSN is set for a quick rally to hit $1 by August 2023 and over 100x growth as the market eyes a rally.\n\nFor more information on TMS Network (TMSN):\n\nPresale: https://presale.tmsnetwork.io/\n\nWebsite: https://tmsnetwork.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/tmsnetworkio\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/tmsnetwork_io\n\nDisclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the author should not be considered as financial advice.

Discover SCENE\n\nJust a few months ago, Neopets Meta CEO Dominic Law publicly promoted the concept of “play-and-earn” Web3 gaming and told Forbes that the cutesy Neopets franchise offered “all the right ingredients” for an NFT game. But now it’s been abruptly canceled—and it’s not entirely clear why.\n\nNeopets Metaverse, a free-to-play title based on the 1999 virtual pet simulator web game, was in its alpha stage of development and the team had already sold over 9,000 Solana NFTs across multiple collections—plus it raised millions from backers including Polygon Ventures and Avalanche\'s ecosystem fund.\n\nOn Monday, the Neopets Team—which refers to itself as the acronym TNT—published a blog post explaining the Neopets Metaverse shutdown and its pivot to a non-crypto mobile game in development called World of Neopets.\n\nNeopets Metaverse Transition: A Message from The Neopets Team Greetings, Neopians! Change is in the air, and Neopets is entering a new era! But what exactly does that mean? Well, for one, Neopets has new leadership, which is working as a new, cohesive unit with TNT to ensure… — Neopets Metaverse (@NeopetsMeta) July 17, 2023\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n“TNT has taken a close look at every nook and cranny of Neopets, and after doing so, the decision has been made to transition away from the Neopets Metaverse game and redistribute those resources to the development of a game that we feel can better reflect our values and vision,” the company said.\n\n“This decision was not made lightly,” TNT added, “but it was made for the best reason: we want to design a game that’s more in line with what the community has been asking for!”\n\nNeopets is now also under “a brand new leadership team,” per the post. Does this mean that Law, its Hong Kong-based Web3 advocate who previously worked at various financial firms, is out?\n\nIt actually appears that he’s staying at the company. Law’s Linkedin profile still shows him at Neopets, and his title shifted this month from “Chief Metaverse Officer” to CEO. That said, it’s unclear whether it was his decision to move Neopets away from NFTs.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLaw has not yet responded to Decrypt’s request for comment.\n\nHowever, Neopets has secured a “management buyout,” meaning it will become independent for the first time in 18 years. Neopets was bought by Viacom in 2005, who later sold it to Jumpstart, which was then acquired by Japanese gaming firm NetDragon—who then shuttered Jumpstart last month.\n\n“Free from the corporate baggage that existed in the past, the newly united TNT has now been entrusted with the decision-making and overall brand strategy of Neopets,” the blog post reads.\n\nThe new Neopets entity is called World of Neopia, Inc. and promises its fans monthly updates, AMAs, and a brand ambassador program. TNT plans to launch a new homepage for Neopets on July 20 and will use an emulator to update its old Flash games and make them playable again.\n\nUnfinished business\n\nIn response to the news, several Twitter users called the now-canceled NFT game “a rug” or rugpull—referring to a type of scam in which creators sell NFTs with promises of future utility, only to abandon said project before the promises are fulfilled without refunding buyers.\n\nNeopets assured one Twitter user that it “will continue to support the Web3 community.” The company echoed that sentiment in its blog post as well, noting that it will continue to operate a Discord server for NFT holders.\n\nWhile TNT said it has “repurposed some of the best assets” from the canceled game, it’s unclear whether NFT owners will be able to claim refunds or see any benefits in the new mobile game, which does not use any form of crypto. A Neopets representative told Decrypt that it plans to offer NFT owners "perks," including its digital "NC" in-game currency and digital items on the platform.\n\n"We are so grateful for the support of the community that has sprung up around the Neopets digital collectable lines, and as a sign of our appreciation we will be announcing more details on future perks soon," the representative said. "These may include physical merch, NC items, NC, access to IRL events, and more."\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe have repurposed some of the best assets from the Neopets Metaverse game, but we have refocused the core game loop and overall direction. We will continue to support the Web3 community that has embraced ownership of these collections. — Neopets Metaverse (@NeopetsMeta) July 17, 2023\n\nAsked if Neopets pivoted away from NFTs due to community backlash, a company representative told Decrypt, "Listening to the voices of the community is paramount to the success of our brand. It’s important to our team to listen to the needs and wants of our fans—this is what’s best for Neopets overall.”\n\nNeopets\' crypto push\n\nNeopets has a history of exploring NFT integrations.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that ETH is currently experiencing a downward trend with selling pressure in the market. The news analyst report highlights significant developments in the cryptocurrency market, including Ripple's legal victory and Binance.US's decision to halt trading for certain cryptocurrencies. These developments could lead to increased volatility in the market as traders adjust to the changes.

In reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a cautious and conservative approach is more successful in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. Long-term strategies should be prioritized over short-term gains to manage risk effectively and maximize profit. Given the bearish outlook for ETH, conflicting signals from news reports, and the potential impact of regulatory and exchange-related developments, a conservative trading approach is warranted.

Considering the synthesized reports and emphasizing long-term strategies, I would take a cautious approach and decide to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.7. This decision is based on the current bearish trend, potential market volatility, and the importance of safeguarding capital in the face of uncertainties.
ACTION:

DAILY RETURN:
-0.0003194703224540518
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the current trend for ETH is bearish, as indicated by the fluctuating open price, lack of bullish momentum in successful transactions, and consistent sell indication from the MACD signal. On the other hand, the news analyst report paints a more positive picture for ETH, suggesting a bullish trend in the coming years driven by new projects, catalysts, and interoperability enhancements.

In light of these conflicting signals, it is important to take a cautious and conservative approach to trading ETH. Long-term strategies have been shown to be more effective in managing risk and maximizing profit in the volatile cryptocurrency market. It is crucial to consider key trends such as the bearish trend in ETH, regulatory developments, market volatility, and exchange-related decisions when making trading decisions.

Therefore, the recommended trading action would be to adopt a conservative approach and prioritize risk management. Given the uncertainties in the market, it is advisable to focus on long-term strategies rather than short-term gains. As such, I would recommend a trading action of 0.3, reflecting a moderate level of confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.

On the other hand, Ethereum smart contracts use Solidity programming language. With the introduction of Solang, developers familiar with Solidity and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) can deploy decentralized applications on the energy-efficient Solana network.\n\nThe Solang compiler will support Solana SPL tokens and compatibility with Ethereum Solidity 0.8. It will also enable access to native Solana built-in functionality, smart contracts, and the ability to call other Solana smart contracts.\n\nThe Solang Solidity compiler is not the first programming language featured on the Solana mainnet. Last year, Seahorse was launched, enabling the popular Python programming language to be integrated with the Solana network.\n\nWill Solang Replace Neon EVM?\n\nOn July 17th, blockchain-focused company Neon Labs debuted the Neon EVM, an innovation that allows Ethereum developers to easily deploy their projects on the Solana blockchain. Solang doesn’t replace Neon EVM, rather it “helps bridge the gap between EVM developers and the Solana ecosystem.”\n\nSolana’s Head of Strategy, Austin Federa, buttressed this point in a tweet using a “strained analogy”:\n\n“Neon EVM lets you run Windows on Mac in a virtual machine, with all the Windows stuff and programs. Solang lets you run a program built for Windows on Mac.”\n\nIn his analogy, Federa likened Ethereum to Windows and Solana to Mac. This goes to say that Solang and Neon EVM will both work to onboard Ethereum developers and dApps into the Solana mainnet.\n\nMeanwhile, Solana’s efforts to expand have rubbed off on the performance of its native cryptocurrency, SOL. A month ago, SOL traded at $16. However, the asset has rebounded, reaching a current trading price of over $26 as its ecosystem grows.'}, {'id': 6, 'time': 'Thu, 20 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Solana Outages Gone? Network Boasts 100% Uptime in Q2 - Crypto Briefing', 'content': 'Share this article URL Copied\n\nDespite its past of unreliability, a Q2 2023 Solana Network maintained an 100% uptime in Q2 2023, according to the Solana Foundation’s Network Performance Report, representing one of many enhancements made to Solana’s network infrastructure and performance during the first half of the year.\n\nThe network, managed by an extensive, independent group of validators worldwide, has shown improvements across several performance metrics, including the ratio of non-voting-to-voting transactions, block production time, and transactions per second.\n\nDan Albert, executive director of the Solana Foundation, suggests that Solana’s performance is only part of the story, according to the press release. The network’s underlying decentralization is also a key point of focus:\n\n“The first half of 2023 presented a number of challenges for the network but the network performed very well and more advancements in the ecosystem are on the way that will further distinguish Solana as the leading decentralized smart contract blockchain.”\n\nSolana measures its network’s decentralization and vitality with four metrics: block-producing validators, RPC nodes, the Nakamoto Coefficient and active open-source developers on the network. The Foundation’s report reveals positive figures for all these metrics.\n\nOn the innovation front, state compression has debuted on Solana. This technique, which allows data to be stored directly on-chain, has drastically cut costs. For instance, minting 100 million NFTs on Solana now costs a mere 50 SOL.\n\nAfter an outage on February 25, Solana made significant strides to improve its network software upgrade process, incorporating additional external developers and auditors into the release process, as well as enhanced server restart processes. Because of this, the network achieved full uptime since the intervention and seamlessly transitioned network version 1.14 to the mainnet.\n\nNext on the list is adding Solana Improvement Documents-33, Timely Vote Credits, to the network in Q3, which is “intended to reduce block finalization times and disincentivize intentionally delayed voting,” according to the report.'}, {'id': 9, 'time': 'Thu, 20 Jul 2023 18:15:56 GMT', 'title': "Ethereum rivals are 'dead on arrival,' says Cumberland's Van Bourg - Blockworks", 'content': 'Despite the crypto market’s turn toward a cautiously positive sentiment, things aren’t looking good for Ethereum’s competitors, according to Jonah Van Bourg.\n\nOn the 1000X podcast (Spotify/Apple), Cumberland’s global head of trading says user counts and wallet addresses have plateaued on alternative layer-1 blockchains.\n\n“Your Solanas, NEARs and Polkadots — and all these other coins — these ecosystems are dead on arrival at this point.”\n\nIn the meantime, Ethereum layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism are flourishing, Van Bourg says. According to Blockworks Research, the TVL, or total value locked — a measure of the monetary value that resides in a blockchain’s ecosystem — is comparatively low on competing chains.\n\nThe current total value locked in Solana stands at approximately $320 million, a little more than one percent of Ethereum’s TVL, which is currently around $26 billion.\n\nEthereum-based layer-2 chains Arbitrum and Optimism are trending positively and already overshadow Solana’s TVL with values of approximately $2 billion and $900 million, respectively.\n\nChart by Blockworks Research analyst Spencer Hughes\n\n“So is the multichain thesis still alive for the next cycle?” Van Bourg asks. “I vote no. I think it’s time to write it off.”\n\nThe greed factor\n\nAvi Feldman, GoldenTree’s head of digital asset trading, is quick to disagree.\n\n“Greed is too large to write it off,” he says. “You get projects that are willing to build on things like Solana and Avalanche and NEAR and all of these other protocols because if they’re a competent, good team, they can win that space.”\n\nIncentive programs will draw value to competing protocols, Felman argues, “when the bull market comes back.”\n\nBut incentive programs have been the “only draw” for the competing chains, Van Bourg retorts. “That doesn’t last forever.”\n\nFelman expects competing chains to experience a “renaissance” due to their novelty and the “greed factor,” arguing that by onboarding people with incentives, they may potentially reach “escape velocity” to become “real projects.”\n\nReferring to a previous interview with Galaxy Digital’s Mike Novogratz (Spotify/Apple), Van Bourg says the next bull cycle will be the “show me” stage of crypto, whereby projects need to prove their worth at a practical level.\n\n“What computational ability is possible on Solana that isn’t possible on Arbitrum or Optimism at this point?” he asks.\n\nFelman says it’s not so much about the tech itself, but instead a matter of “use-case fit.”\n\n“The constraint is not always the tech. The constraint is figuring out what to do with the tech,” he says.\n\nVan Bourg agrees, but suggests that the argument only further proves his point. “If it isn’t about the tech, what’s the advantage of one shiny alt-L1 versus another versus ETH?” Ethereum, he says, “gives you everything you need right now for today’s limited slate of use-cases.”\n\n“If ETH was bowling over because of too many people trying to use it or too much throughput,” Van Bourg says, “then you have an alt-L1 thesis right there.”\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

You probably forgot how you ended up being their fan, but you are in too deep to change your allegiance.\n\nBut that might be changing now, thanks to Miami startup Cosmic Wire. As the crypto winter begins to thaw, the startup is working to develop cross-chain web3 solutions.\n\nThis week, Cosmic Wire announced that they have raised a $30 million seed round from lead investors Solana Foundation and Polygon. The startup is developing a series of blockchain infrastructure products. According to Coindesk, this includes solutions for analytics, digital identity management, smart contract development tools, and chain-agnostic marketplaces.\n\nWhy does the cross-chain nature of Cosmic Wire matter? Because this approach facilitates data transfer interoperability across different blockchains. And Cosmic Wire hopes to do so without compromising privacy. Much to the contrary, the company reports that they hope to provide users with sovereign control over their data and online interactions.\n\n“We are very excited for Cosmic Wire’s Web3 infrastructure to be built on the Solana network,” commented Johnny Lee, general manager of Games, Entertainment, and Media at the Solana Foundation, the non-profit promoting the adoption of the Solana ecosystem.\n\n“Their metaverse SDK solutions significantly reduce development times of high-fidelity, 3D, browser-based metaverse experiences with e-commerce of both physical web3 digital products, content CDNs, payment solutions and avatar UGC all integrated,” Lee continued. “Solana Foundation has always supported tools and infrastructure builders, and we are excited for Cosmic Wire to deliver new metaverse experiences on the Solana network that have never been possible before.”\n\nNext up for Cosmic Wire is joining Google Cloud’s web3 startup program. Among many benefits of the program are up to $200,000 in Google Cloud credits and priority review for the Polygon Ventures Ecosystem Fund and dedicated investment dollars totaling up to $3 million.\n\nCosmic Wire founder and CEO Jerad Finck has the diverse kind of background you would only find in the Web3 space. After a stint on the tech team of Nokia during the dotcom boom, Finck launched a mental wellness center serving low-income patients. He then launched a music publishing and catalog representation company and worked as a musician and producer himself – working for clients including Sony, Universal, and Warner Bros. Finck started working on Cosmic Wire in June 2021.\n\n“We are so grateful for the overwhelming support from our investors and partners,” said Finck. “Thanks to the massive success of the seed round, we’re now empowering creators, businesses, and entire industry sectors connecting people globally, and transforming the very way we communicate and transact.”\n\nHe added: “Cosmic Wire is blazing the path forward driving Web3 in exciting new ways resulting in exponential increases of efficiencies and monetization of systems at scale.

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain, news, and reflection analyst reports, it is clear that there are conflicting signals in the market. The on-chain analysis indicates a bearish trend for ETH, with decreasing open prices and total transactions, as well as a consistent sell signal from the MACD indicator.

In light of these conflicting signals, it is important to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains. The reflection analyst report highlights the effectiveness of a cautious and conservative approach in managing risk and maximizing profit in the volatile cryptocurrency market. By closely monitoring key trends and maintaining a conservative trading approach, investors can navigate uncertainties in the market effectively.

Considering the conflicting signals and the importance of long-term strategies, I would take a neutral trading action with a confidence level of 0.0. This decision reflects a balanced approach to managing risk and avoiding potential losses in the current market environment. By staying cautious and focusing on long-term goals, I aim to maximize overall profit and navigate the market with prudence.

The enhanced network performance marks a striking transformation from the previous year when layer-1 network outages caused severe disruptions.\n\nA new report released by Solana Foundation stated that the subsequent upgrades, including the rollout of QUIC TPU, Stake weighted QoS, and localized fee markets, have helped the network to handle high traffic and demand.\n\nSolana Completes One Whole Quarter Without Outage\n\nThe foundation mentioned that Solana – run by a group of independent validators around the world – has demonstrated improvements across various performance metrics.\n\nThis includes enhancements in ratios of non-voting-to-voting transactions. A voting transaction happens when a validator votes to confirm one or more proposed blocks of information. On the other hand, non-voting transactions are the ones triggered by user behavior on the blockchain.\n\nIn the latest report, Solana Foundation said that it expects “to see the ratio of voting to non-voting transactions go down because the overall percentage of voting transactions should drop as the network gets more efficient.”\n\nThe block production time – which measures how quickly the network adds more “blocks” to the blockchain – has followed a consistent trajectory besides a spike during the February outage.\n\nMoreover, the average transactions per second on the Solana network remained relatively similar since December 2022. Some volatility was observed, which correlated with high network demand, the foundation’s statement read. The maximum daily transactions per second have been on a steady rise since January. Data from Dune Analytics suggests that the network currently recorded 3,781 TPS as of July 20.\n\nNetwork Upgrades\n\nThe improvements across the metrics were achieved after core developers rolled out upgrades that enabled the network to perform well in times of high stress.\n\nThe Solana devs have doubled down on testing while developing other network upgrades and initiatives, including increasing maximum transaction sizes (currently limited to 1232 bytes). Simplifying the voting logic, which reduces the overall amount of data needed to be transmitted and stored, is yet another aspect that the devs are working on.\n\nAccording to the Solana Foundation, the advancements have helped solidify its position in the layer-1 space after its credibility was severely dented by a series of outages last year.'}, {'id': 5, 'time': 'Fri, 21 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Solana Launches GameShift API For Web3 Game Development - CoinCodex', 'content': 'Key Highlights:\n\nSolana launches GameShift API to simplify and facilitate the process of building games for developers.\n\nSolana-based API will provide developers easy access to custody solutions, marketplaces, inventory management, NFT minting, and credit card on-ramps and off-ramps.\n\nIn a bid to facilitate the development of web3 games on Solana, the renowned tech firm behind the blockchain, Solana Labs has announced the launch of GameShift. The firm made the thrilling announcement during the PlayGG event, a community-centric celebration of games on Solana in San Diego.\n\nOwing to the core challenges faced by the web3 gaming industry, GameShift, a unified web3 game development API designed to simplify and accelerate web3 game production steps in not only to make the industry thrilling for gamers but majorly easier for developers.\n\nTal Tchwella, head of product at Solana Labs, emphasized the importance of innovative technology for web3 game developers, aiming to streamline and elevate the game-building process. According to Tal, GameShift is the solution to this pressing need, as it focuses on creating the ownership layer for games. This innovative platform will serve as a comprehensive one-stop shop for developers on Solana, empowering them to build their games with greater speed and confidence.\n\nSolana-based API Provides Extensive Game Development Toolkits in One Interface\n\nFollowing concerns to curtail gaming complexities, Solana Labs understands the heavy need to integrate different technologies from multiple providers. As such, with its newly introduced API, developers will be provided with access to all the required tools combined in one interface, thereby simplifying and accelerating the game-building process.\n\nAccording to the announcement, the innovative API is capable of providing developers with tools to build high-quality web3 game experiences, including custody solutions, efficient marketplaces, inventory management, NFT minting, and credit card on-ramps and off-ramps. This suggests a new era of exciting opportunities for developers and gamers alike.\n\nWhile GameShift is expected to officially launch later this year, interested users can begin to sign up for early access via Solana. Nonetheless, its integration on the Solana blockchain appears to be garnering the interest of developers in the gaming space as they begin to anticipate an era of exclusive opportunities where they can access a full stack of trusted third-party web3 components on Solana via a unified API.\n\nFurthermore, Solana Labs had also revealed significant development which showcased over 40 games available for play on the Solana platform.

ON-CHAIN ANALYST REPORT:
"""
Based on the recent data, the open price of ETH has been fluctuating between 25.38 and 27.40, with a decreasing trend overall. The total transactions and successful transactions have also been varying, indicating some volatility in market activity. The MACD signal consistently shows a sell indication, suggesting a bearish trend in the market. Therefore, it is likely that the price of ETH may continue to decrease in the near future. Investors should exercise caution and consider selling or holding their positions.
"""

NEWS ANALYST REPORT:
"""
The recent movement of significant amounts of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Shiba Inu, and Chainlink by high-net-worth traders indicates potential market volatility and strategic positioning. Solana's network performance has been stable, with improvements in key metrics, while the launch of the GameShift API aims to enhance web3 game development on the Solana blockchain. However, investor sentiment appears to be shifting towards Tradecurve (TCRV) due to its perceived stability and profitability, with concerns raised about the future growth of TRON (TRX) and Solana (SOL). Additionally, Bitcoin's price remains under pressure, with mixed performance among other top cryptocurrencies like Ether, Matic, and Solana. Overall, the market trend may see increased volatility and potential shifts in investor preferences towards more stable assets like Tradecurve.
"""

REFLECTION ANALYST REPORT:
"""
In reflecting on recent trading performance, it is evident that a cautious and conservative approach based on a combination of on-chain and news analysis has been effective in managing risk and maximizing profit. Prioritizing long-term strategies over short-term gains has proven successful in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. Key trends to consider in future trades include the bearish trend in ETH indicated by the MACD signal, positive developments in the Solana ecosystem attracting investor interest, and the importance of monitoring market activity and successful transactions. Given the current market environment and conflicting signals, a conservative trading approach is warranted to minimize potential losses and navigate uncertainties effectively.

The InvestAnswers host mentions a prediction made by Blofin, a crypto-financial services firm that sees Ethereum rising to $9,700 following the update.\n\n“Per Blofin, they predict that after the Cancun upgrade of Ethereum, price could exceed $9,700 per ETH in the first quarter of 2024. And of course, that is their most optimistic case…\n\nThe next question is always, ‘Well if Ethereum goes to $9,700, what’s the price of Solana?’ I calculated it for you. It’s going to be at least $250 if ETH hits $9,700.\n\nRemember $9,700 from where it is now is over a 5x and of course, Solana goes up faster than ETH will at that time.”\n\nWhile the InvestAnswers host believes that Ethereum could rally to $9,700, he doesn’t see the surge happening in the coming months.\n\n“Great to see $9,700 ETH. Maybe we’ll see in the bull run. I doubt we’ll see it in the first quarter of 2024, but perhaps early 2025.”\n\nLooking at Bitcoin (BTC), the anonymous analyst reiterates his prediction that the flagship crypto asset will soar by over 40% from current levels by early next year.\n\n“I did say many times a few months ago, I would not be surprised if we had a $42,000 Bitcoin target by somewhere between January and April of 2024.”\n\nBitcoin is trading at $29,804 at time of writing.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on X Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain, news, and reflection analyst reports, it is clear that there are conflicting signals in the market. The on-chain analysis indicates a bearish trend for ETH, with decreasing open prices and total transactions, as well as a consistent sell signal from the MACD indicator. On the other hand, the news analysis suggests a bullish trend for altcoins like Solana and XRP due to positive developments in their respective projects.

In light of these conflicting signals, it is important to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains. The reflection analyst report highlights the effectiveness of a cautious and conservative approach in managing risk and maximizing profit in the volatile cryptocurrency market. By closely monitoring key trends and maintaining a conservative trading approach, investors can navigate uncertainties in the market effectively.

Considering the conflicting signals and the importance of long-term strategies, I would take a neutral trading action with a confidence level of 0.0. This decision reflects a balanced approach to managing risk and avoiding potential losses in the current market environment. By staying cautious and focusing on long-term goals, I aim to maximize overall profit and navigate the market with prudence.
ACTION:
0.0
DAILY RETURN:
-0.002487672011991404
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the price of ETH is likely to continue decreasing in the near future due to the bearish trend indicated by the MACD signal. The high level of activity in the market is not translating into successful transactions, which is a concerning sign for investors. 

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights positive developments in the Solana ecosystem, potentially attracting more investors and developers to the network. This could impact the market trend in favor of Solana in the near term, indicating a shift away from ETH.

In reflection, a conservative trading approach that considers both on-chain and news analysis has been effective in managing risk and maximizing profit. Long-term strategies have proven to be more successful in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market.

Considering the conflicting signals from the on-chain and news analysis, it is important to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains. Therefore, I would take a cautious approach and consider selling my ETH positions to minimize potential losses in the current market environment. 

My trading action would be -0.7, reflecting a moderate level of confidence in the market trend favoring Solana over ETH and my strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.

Based on the recent data, the ETH cryptocurrency has been experiencing a downward trend as indicated by the consecutive "sell" signals on the MACD indicator. The open prices have been fluctuating between 23.38 and 26.37, with a decrease in total transactions and successful transactions over time. However, the last two data points show a potential reversal in the trend with "buy" signals on the MACD indicator and an increase in successful transactions. It is possible that the market may be stabilizing and starting to show signs of a bullish trend in the near future. Further monitoring of the market is recommended to confirm this potential shift in trend.

It opened trading at $24.76, dipped to $24.07, hit a high of $24.83, with a trading volume of 578.352k, constitutes of sellers.\n\nAccording to market analysts, the SOL price might have been affected by the recent decisions of Parrot Protocol to redeem PRT tokens for liquid treasury value and also to transition to a no-token protocol. The PRT redemption price was established at $0.0045 per token based on the proposal.\n\nRelevant data shows that Parrot Protocol is a Solana-based liquidity network offering borrowing and lending services.

According to Mullarney, Solana’s potential surge is expected to be prompted by Ethereum’s Cancun upgrade. (JAKUB PORZYCKI/GETTY IMAGES)\n\nMullarney refered to a forecast by Blofin, a crypto-financial services firm, predicting that Ethereum could rise to $9,700 after the update.\n\n“Per Blofin, they predict that after the Cancun upgrade of Ethereum, the price could exceed $9,700 per ETH in the first quarter of 2024. And of course, that is their most optimistic case,” Mullarney said in the video.\n\n“The next question is always, if Ethereum goes to $9,700, what’s the price of Solana? I calculated it for you. It will be at least $250 if ETH hits $9,700. Remember $9,700 from where it is now is over a 5x, and, of course, Solana goes up faster than ETH will at that time,” the InvestAnswers host added.\n\nAccording to Mullarney, although Ethereum could potentially reach $9,700, he doesn’t anticipate the surge happening in the coming months. Instead, he believes it may occur during the bull run, possibly in early 2025, rather than the first quarter of 2024.\n\nRegarding Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), Mullarney reaffirmed his previous prediction that the flagship cryptocurrency could increase by over 40% from its current levels by early next year.\n\n“As I mentioned several times a few months ago, I wouldn’t be surprised if Bitcoin reached a $42,000 target somewhere between January and April of 2024,” he said.\n\nSolana is a rapidly emerging cryptocurrency and blockchain platform that has gained substantial attention in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Launched in 2020 by Anatoly Yakovenko, it seeks to address the scalability issues plaguing other blockchain networks, aiming to process over 65,000 transactions per second, thanks to its innovative proof-of-history and proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms. Solana’s speed and low fees have made it an attractive choice for developers and users alike.\n\nIts native token, SOL, powers the ecosystem, facilitating transactions, staking, and governing the network.

The tour, the band’s first on the West Coast in over a decade, left devoted Biscuits fans buzzing with excitement, declaring it one of the best runs of music from the trance/rock fusion ensemble in years.\n\nOver the course of 14 shows, the Disco Biscuits delivered an incredible musical journey, leaving fans mesmerized by their jams equipped with seamless transitions. The camaraderie among band members was also palpable as they effortlessly communicated on stage, crafting intricate musical landscapes that captivated their devoted fanbase.\n\nBass guitarist Marc Brownstein expressed his delight at the tour’s success, stating, “Having 14 shows in a row really allowed us to develop things in a way we haven’t in two decades. We have developed a little language on stage, allowing us to communicate nearly telepathically during our jams. We feel like we’re as good of a band as we’ve ever been and we can’t wait to keep it going into our fall tour and of course, BISCOLAND.”\n\nThe final show in Solana Beach was a tour de force of musical prowess, featuring two 5-song sets that showcased both new tracks and beloved classics. The band masterfully weaved their newer songs, like “Photograph,” into lengthy improvisational journeys, much to the delight of the audience. The setlist included crowd favorites such as “Voices Insane,” “Tourists (Rocket Ship),” “Shocked,” and a cover of Dead Or Alive’s dance classic “You Spin Me Round (Like a Record),” which brought the night to an exhilarating close.\n\nThroughout the tour, the Disco Biscuits delivered several standout performances, including a monumental 34-minute “Voices Insane” jam in Montana and a captivating 30-minute “I-Man” in Bend, Ore. The Pacific Northwest was treated to more awe-inspiring improvisations, with a 32-minute “Mindless Dribble” in Portland, Ore., and a memorable rendition of fan-favorite “Nughuffer” in Seattle.\n\nNotably, the Disco Biscuits’ West Coast tour saw larger crowds than ever before, with their Los Angeles show at The Roxy Theatre selling out within days of tickets being released. The band rewarded their fervent fans with an unforgettable performance, including an explosive version of their newer track, “The Wormhole,” and a non-stop dance party during the second set.\n\nAs the West Coast tour comes to a close, the Disco Biscuits have an array of upcoming events, including the Catskill Mountain Jubilee performance and their inaugural BISCOLAND festival in Lafayette, N.Y.\n\nThe two-day festival will take place at Wonderland Forest and feature an impressive lineup of jam, jamtronica, and electronic music artists, with the Disco Biscuits and Lotus headlining the event. The festival will also include performances from Emancipator, Papadosio, Opiuo, Sunsquabi, The Floozies, Eggy, Maddy O’Neal, Space Bacon, and a special Spaga Plays Dead set by the Disco Biscuits’ member Aron Magner.'}, {'id': 3, 'time': 'Mon, 24 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Frenetic Shooter 'Ev.io' Lets You Earn Solana While Fragging Enemies - Decrypt", 'content': 'Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nEv.io is a free-to-play, web-based shooter that recalls first-person shooter pioneers like Quake and Unreal Tournament—but this one lets users earn cryptocurrency for playing, too.\n\nSet in a futuristic world, your character is equipped with a gun of your choice and a melee weapon. You have the option of fighting enemies in a free-for-all deathmatch or battling it out in teams, plus you can dip into a sniper shotgun mode or a survival mode akin to the popular Call of Duty “Zombies” experience.\n\nIn all of the available modes, you can pick up unique weapons or health boosts from the ground. The special weapons are a lot of fun to use and have sourced some of my favorite moments in the game. There\'s something so gratifying about shooting someone with a rocket launcher across the map.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYou can also select a range of abilities and equipment before entering a game. In a fairly limited skill tree, you have the option to activate the abilities to teleport, triple jump, and more.\n\nA personal favorite is the impulse grenade that can launch any unlucky opponent clear across the map. This makes for a lot of fun outplays and cool in-game moments—and sure enough, launching myself into the air and sniping someone just feels awesome.\n\nThat said, impulse grenades, teleporting, and other in-game movement controls can make the game difficult to pick up at first. Not only do you need to spend time learning how to use these options effectively, but it also means that hitting your enemy is more difficult.\n\nVery rarely will you encounter someone standing still, and with the character models being so skinny, this can be tough to adjust to at first. For this reason, trip wires and mines are super useful. You can put them in a high-traffic area and play around them, luring your enemies into an explosive outcome or using them to protect your own back.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAn NFT boost\n\nAfter purchasing an optional Ev.io NFT on Solana and equipping it in-game, you\'re able to earn an in-game currency called "e.” The amount of e you earn is based on your in-game score, which is primarily based on the number of kills you get. You can also earn e from events, daily quests, clan wars, and more.\n\nOnce you have 10,000 e, you are able to convert it to Solana (SOL) and then you can opt to cash out for fiat currency at an exchange. A developer from the Ev.io team on Discord told Decrypt that the conversion rate varies, but is approximately $1 worth of SOL per 2,000 “e” earned as of this writing.\n\nI purchased the Bonk character—named for the BONK cryptocurrency, itself inspired by Dogecoin and Shiba Inu—for around $22 worth of SOL. Not only did this make me stand out and feel cool in-game, but the play-to-earn element really intensified the experience for me. I felt like I was a hitman; every kill counted to slowly earn back the money I\'d put down.\n\nAfter an hour of gaming—only topping the leaderboard once—I earned 124 e. That’s only worth about six cents worth of SOL when converted, so it\'s clear that events, quests, and clan wars should be your main form of attack if you plan to make your money back.\n\nFamiliarity sets in\n\nDespite Ev.io’s great foundations, it feels like there is a lack of variety that keeps you wanting to boot up the game over and over again. The weapon meta feels fairly stale, as everyone uses the auto rifle. Sometimes I\'d switch it up and use the laser rifle for fun, but the other default weapons didn\'t seem to get much use.\n\nEqually, the difference between the free-for-all and team deathmatch wasn\'t very apparent. It doesn\'t feel like teamwork is really important, meaning both game modes have a similar feel. You could drop into the sniper shotgun mode, but you can\'t earn the e currency there—and ultimately, it comes across as a restrictive riff on the free-for-all mode.\n\nA screenshot from Ev.io. Image: Decrypt\n\nFor this reason, the Zombies-like survival mode has an important place in the game to take a break from the online deathmatch grind.\n\nThe variety of Ev.io’s maps is pretty impressive. They all have unique color schemes with fun lines of sight and places to launch. Rarely do the maps fall into the typical three-lane structure a lot of shooters rely on. And there\'s not a map that I groan at when it pops up.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEv.io\'s graphics are very basic in order to optimize the game for all desktop devices. That said, while simplistic, the art style is consistent with its futuristic theme, opting for sleek lines and neon colors—giving a “Tron” vibe all the while.\n\nOverall, Ev.io is a great option amongst crypto and NFT games, especially considering that it is free-to-play and available for anyone to play in a web browser. The emphasis on movement makes it fun to traverse the map, while adding a unique skill curve to entering the game.\n\nThat said, after a few hours playing the game, it can get a bit repetitive with a lack of variety in the weapon meta and game modes.

The news articles provide a mixed outlook for the Solana (SOL) cryptocurrency. On one hand, there is positive sentiment surrounding Solana's potential price surge, with analysts predicting a significant increase in value, potentially reaching $250, driven by Ethereum's upcoming upgrades. However, recent developments such as the Parrot Protocol's decisions and the decline in SOL's trading volume may have contributed to a short-term price drop.

REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the current trend for ETH is bearish, with a decrease in successful transactions and a sell signal from the MACD indicator. This suggests a potential further decline in the near future. 

However, the news analyst report presents a more positive outlook for ETH, with projections of significant growth once Ethereum's bull run starts, potentially reaching $9,700. This positive sentiment is also supported by the potential rise in Bitcoin's price and the predicted surge in Solana's value.

In reflection of these reports, it is evident that a cautious and conservative approach is necessary in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. While short-term gains may be tempting, prioritizing long-term strategies based on a combination of on-chain and news analysis can help manage risk effectively.

The recent buy signal from the MACD indicator may indicate a potential reversal, but further confirmation is needed.

The news analyst report highlights the importance of monitoring the market closely for any potential catalysts that could influence the price movement of ETH. In the absence of specific news, the market is likely to continue following its current trend or consolidate until new developments impact the price.

The reflection analyst report emphasizes the effectiveness of a combination of on-chain and news analysis in making informed trading decisions. It also stresses the importance of prioritizing long-term strategies over short-term gains to navigate the volatile cryptocurrency market successfully.

Considering the synthesized reports, the clear market trend for ETH appears to be bearish in the short term.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the current trend for ETH is bearish, with a decrease in successful transactions and a sell signal from the MACD indicator. This suggests a potential further decline in the near future. 

However, the news analyst report presents a more positive outlook for ETH, with projections of significant growth once Ethereum's bull run starts, potentially reaching $9,700. This positive sentiment is also supported by the potential rise in Bitcoin's price and the predicted surge in Solana's value.

In reflection of these reports, it is evident that a cautious and conservative approach is necessary in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. While short-term gains may be tempting, prioritizing long-term strategies based on a combination of on-chain and news analysis can help manage risk effectively.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is important to focus on the long-term potential for growth in ETH and other related cryptocurrencies. Therefore, my trading action would be to buy ETH with a confidence level of 0.6, indicating a moderate level of confidence in the positive market trend for ETH in the long term. This decision aligns with the need to manage risk appropriately and maximize profit potential over time.
ACTION:
0.6
DAILY RETURN:
0.0033293723241745177
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the ETH market is currently experiencing a bearish trend with decreasing open prices and consistent sell signals from the MACD indicator. The total transactions remain relatively high, but the decreasing successful transactions suggest a potential decrease in demand for ETH. The recent buy signal from the MACD indicator may indicate a potential reversal, but further confirmation is needed.

The news analyst report highlights the importance of monitoring the market closely for any potential catalysts that could influence the price movement of ETH. In the absence of specific news, the market is likely to continue following its current trend or consolidate until new developments impact the price.

The reflection analyst report emphasizes the effectiveness of a combination of on-chain and news analysis in making informed trading decisions. It also stresses the importance of prioritizing long-term strategies over short-term gains to navigate the volatile cryptocurrency market successfully.

Considering the synthesized reports, the clear market trend for ETH appears to be bearish in the short term. Therefore, it is advisable to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains to manage risk effectively. As a result, I would take a conservative approach and decide to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.7 to reflect my cautious stance in the current market conditions.
ACTION:

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market has been experiencing a downward trend but may be showing signs of a potential reversal with recent "buy" signals on the MACD indicator. The news analyst report provides a mixed outlook for Solana, indicating short-term fluctuations but a positive long-term outlook for growth and increased adoption.

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a combination of on-chain and news analysis, along with a focus on long-term strategies, is crucial in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market.

*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
After reviewing the on-chain, news, and reflection analyst reports, it is clear that the market sentiment for ETH is currently bearish, with a downward trend in open prices and fluctuating transaction volumes. The mixed sentiment in the news, along with potential volatility ahead due to key events like the US Federal Reserve meeting and developments in Solana-based projects, adds to the uncertainty in the market.

However, the reflection analyst report highlights the importance of long-term strategies and a conservative trading approach to maximize profit potential and manage risk effectively. It emphasizes the need to consider potential reversals in trends and prioritize long-term potential over short-term gains.

Taking into account the synthesized reports, it is advisable to adopt a cautious approach and focus on long-term strategies for trading ETH. While short-term fluctuations may occur, the overall positive long-term outlook for cryptocurrencies like ETH suggests that holding onto investments and waiting for potential reversals in the market could lead to more successful outcomes.

Therefore, I would take a slightly conservative approach and assign a trading action of 0.3, indicating moderate confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately by prioritizing long-term potential over short-term gains.

The altcoin has outperformed several of its contemporaries, gaining an impressive 65% in value over the past few weeks, despite losing around 20% from its recent local peak.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bullish forecast for Solana comes from a detailed comparison with Ethereum\'s early days. Analysts have noted striking similarities between Ethereum\'s initial trajectory and the current path of Solana, leading to predictions that Solana might follow a comparable growth pattern. The comparisons have led to the belief that, like Ethereum, Solana could become a prominent player in the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nA statement from a renowned analyst read, "So long as you don\'t mid-curve it, you can see the inevitable from a few years away." The comment highlights the importance of analyzing long-term trends and not getting distracted by temporary fluctuations. Despite Solana\'s recent 20% drop, the overall momentum and growth narrative remain undeterred.\n\nSolana\'s rise as the darling of this cycle can be attributed to its robust technological infrastructure and growing ecosystem.

With a vast array of cryptocurrencies now on the market, it’s hard to sift through what different cryptocurrencies have to offer.\n\n\n\nFind out more from FinTech Magazine’s Top 10 cryptocurrencies on the market today.\n\nPeer-to-peer cryptocurrency and open-source software project Litecoin is among the earliest alternative coins starting in 2011. Inspired by Bitcoin, Litecoin’s main blockchain is slightly modified from Bitcoin’s codebase to offer lower transaction fees, faster confirmation of a transaction, and faster mining difficulty retargeting. In addition, Litecoin uses Scrypt, an alternative proof-of-work algorithm from that used by Bitcoin (SHA-256 algorithm). The cryptocurrency has added optional privacy features in recent times as a soft fork, through the MimbleWimble extension block upgrade.\n\nSolana is a crypto platform that operates a new proof-of-stake model, as opposed to traditional proof-of-work models, providing smart contract functionality through its native cryptocurrency SOL. First opening in March 2020, Solana’s blockchain was designed for supporting decentralised apps and smart contracts. In 2021, the company sold US$314m of its native SOL to funding groups led by Polychain Capital and Andreessen Horowitz. While crypto markets have fluctuated following FTX’s bankruptcy, Solana’s last reported market valuation stood at US$7bn.\n\nCreated by software engineers Jackson Palmer and Billy Markus, Dogecoin is an altcoin traded against fiat and other cryptocurrencies. Initially founded as a joke, or the world’s first “meme coin”, Dogecoin has developed into a legitimate investment prospect. The altcoin saw its value boom in 2021, which rose over 800% in the space of 24 hours – and has been subject to turbulent market conditions surrounding crypto ever since. This even includes a price increase when Twitter owner Elon Musk temporarily changed the Twitter app logo to a Doge logo.\n\nPublic blockchain platform Cardano operates an open-source, decentralised blockchain platform that facilitates peer-to-peer transactions with its internal cryptocurrency ADA. Overseen by the Cardano Foundation in Switzerland, the platform’s development was led by the co-founder of Ethereum Charles Hoskinson. Much like Solana, Cardano employs the use of a proof-of-stake blockchain, a more sustainable and environmentally friendly option than proof-of-work models. Launched in 2017, Cardano reached a record-high market capitalisation of US$77bn in 2021, the fourth highest of any blockchain platform at the time.\n\nRipple operates a cryptocurrency exchange, remittance network and real-time gross settlement system that employs its native cryptocurrency XRP. With a mission to build crypto solutions for an economically borderless world, Ripple provides its customers with solutions to source crypto and facilitate instant payments, including for XRP. Although Ripple’s XRP has faced scrutiny after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) launched a class action against the crypto platform provider for falling foul of US Howey requirements, Ripple’s currency remains robust in many global markets.\n\nUSD Coin (USDC) is a stablecoin attached to the US dollar. Founded by Circle, USDC is managed by a consortium called Centre, and includes Coinbase members as well as from Bitmain, a Bitcoin mining company with investment in Circle. Unlike central digital banking currencies (CBDCs), USDC is a private crypto stablecoin, despite its affiliation with centralised US currency (USD). Available as an Ethereum ERC-20 token, USDC can be bought, traded and held on blockchains including Solana, Stellar, Polygon and Avalanche.'}, {'id': 3, 'time': 'Wed, 26 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'No More Outages?

With developers rapidly building new dApps and integrations, we could soon see Solana's revived technical foundations lead to the real user and transaction growth. Developers have likely identified and resolved many of the causes behind past network disruptions.\n\nHowever, skeptics will want to see sustained stability from Solana over a longer period before fully accepting that the network's problems are in the past.

Ethereum, for example, runs smoothly even with 4-5x more daily active users and transactions than Solana currently handles.\n\nTo catch up, Solana Labs says priorities include continued infrastructure upgrades, establishing decentralized governance, and further decentralizing the validator network. The company also plans to implement optimizations like sharding to boost throughput and introduce features like state proofs to reduce storage costs.\n\nAdditionally, some critics argue that Solana's focus on speed and low fees comes at the expense of true decentralization. Solana uses a centralized development model led by Solana Labs. It also tends to favor large validator nodes, with the top 7 validators controlling 33% of voting power at times. Addressing these concerns could strengthen Solana against censorship risks.\n\nThe road ahead\n\nIf Solana can maintain and build upon the momentum of the first half of 2023, it will go a long way toward shedding lingering doubts about the network's reliability. While Solana still has a lot of ground to cover to be as battle-tested as some competitors, its base layer performance and capabilities continue to improve.\n\nWith developer interest remaining high thanks to fast speeds and low costs, Solana looks poised to be a major player in the future of Web3. But delivering a stable, outage-free experience even as usage grows will ultimately determine if Solana can fulfill its lofty ambitions.\n\nIn the meantime, Solana's SOL token faces regulatory challenges that could dampen enthusiasm. The SEC has deemed SOL a security, causing some platforms to delist it. A stable network could be news leading the SOL price to rise. Solana's price forecast predicts that the price could rise 10.5% in 30 days to reach $26.02.\n\nIf you want to learn more about where SOL could be headed in the future, check our SOL price prediction for 2040 and 2050."}, {'id': 5, 'time': 'Wed, 26 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "'Alchemy: Battle for Ankhos' RPG Mashes Up Discord, Generative AI, and Solana NFTs - Decrypt", 'content': 'Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub.

Decrypt saw the game in action at the recent Solana PlayGG event in San Diego.\n\n“Discord has a few advantages for building social games,” Creative Director Alex Finden told Decrypt. “One of those is that all of the game activities happen in this interactive environment that people are already very comfortable with,” he added, further explaining that the platform makes it easy for players to spectate and challenge each other.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAlchemy: Battle for Ankhos is a text and turn-based role-playing game (RPG), which holds its battles in a fantasy world via the game\'s official Discord server. It also uses the Solana blockchain for its NFT-based items, including in-game characters.\n\n"Nearly every in-game asset earned or purchased is optionally mintable as an NFT on Solana," Finden said. "Any player can mint their assets from in-game menus with no blockchain knowledge or experience required," he said, adding that a launch date for the assets has not yet been determined.\n\nImage: Alchemy: Battle for Ankhos\n\nThe inaugural NFT collection for the game will be called the Alchemy: Gods collection. Players can collect one of 5,000 unique Alchemy Gods, and accrue the soon-to-be-introduced Solana-based token SPIRIT through a new faction-based gameplay mode.\n\nAlchemy: Battle for Ankhos was among five winners of the Solana Foundation’s NFT Showdown in June. At SolanaPlayGG, Finden unveiled its Land Shard NFTs.\n\nSolana was already a popular destination for NFTs and digital collectibles. Now, the Solana Foundation and Solana Labs aim to make it the destination for gaming, thanks to initiatives like last week’s PlayGG event in San Diego and the upcoming GameShift toolkit for developers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDiscord gaming\n\nAlchemy: Battle for Ankhos players take on the role of a Descendant as a mage, squire, cleric, or rogue, and can play against an AI-controlled opponent or join player-vs-player (PvP) battles against other users.\n\nGaming via Discord servers is not a totally new concept. Other text-based games on the platform include IdleRPG, PokeMeow, and the classic game of chess. However, Alchemy: Battle for Ankhos opts for a distinctive hybrid approach, looping in crypto assets while also tapping into generative AI smarts.\n\nDiscord offers several tools for developers, Finden explained, including APIs that make creating and deploying games quickly very easy. An application programming interface (API) is a way for two or more computer programs to communicate with each other.\n\n“We can turn around game modes and our fantasy RPG in about two weeks,” Finden said, “because of all of the tools that Discord allows us.”\n\nImage: Alchemy: Battle for Ankhos\n\nFinden said two types of players are most interested in Alchemy: Battle for Ankhos—the classic turn-based strategy player that wants to be competitive with the game, and the Web3 die-hard that wants to come in, have power over the world, influence the players, and see if they can capitalize on some value that the ecosystem has generated.\n\n“We\'ve designed the game modes and the tradable assets in the game in a way where the Web3 players and the Web2 players create this circular economy,” Finden said, emphasizing that no cryptocurrency needs to be spent to play on Discord.\n\nIt\'s time to Descend. 🔻 pic.twitter.com/gTdQXchMfe — Alchemy: Battle for Ankhos (@play_alchemy) June 27, 2023\n\nMuch of the computational work is done on a server that operates in the background, and the team leverages Discord’s scalability to circumvent any network congestion on the platform.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n“The demand is minimal as the files are extremely small, especially when compared to larger 3D-model games,” Finden said. “As such, server capacity and scalability are not an issue for us.”\n\nAI assistance\n\nSince the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot and the generative art platform Midjourney, advances in generative AI have enabled creators to generate dialogue and images for adventure games quickly with minimal skill. Finden said AI has allowed the small team to produce a volume of content that traditionally would have taken a robust squad of artists.\n\n“We have two options. We can either hire a full art studio, which takes a lot of time and iteration to nail our vision,” he said, “or I can just get really good at using the prompts to allow AI to create the vision that I have.”\n\nAI has become integral to the game, Finden said.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the ETH market is currently experiencing a bearish trend with decreasing open prices and consistent sell signals from the MACD indicator. The total transactions remain relatively high, but the decreasing successful transactions suggest a potential decrease in demand for ETH. The recent buy signal from the MACD indicator may indicate a potential reversal, but further confirmation is needed.

The news analyst report highlights the importance of monitoring the market closely for any potential catalysts that could influence the price movement of ETH. In the absence of specific news, the market is likely to continue following its current trend or consolidate until new developments impact the price.

The reflection analyst report emphasizes the effectiveness of a combination of on-chain and news analysis in making informed trading decisions. It also stresses the importance of prioritizing long-term strategies over short-term gains to navigate the volatile cryptocurrency market successfully.

Considering the synthesized reports, the clear market trend for ETH appears to be bearish in the short term. Therefore, it is advisable to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains to manage risk effectively. As a result, I would take a conservative approach and decide to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.7 to reflect my cautious stance in the current market conditions.
ACTION:
-0.7
DAILY RETURN:
-0.011842262633386058
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market has been experiencing a downward trend but may be showing signs of a potential reversal with recent "buy" signals on the MACD indicator. The news analyst report provides a mixed outlook for Solana, indicating short-term fluctuations but a positive long-term outlook for growth and increased adoption.

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a combination of on-chain and news analysis, along with a focus on long-term strategies, is crucial in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. While short-term trends and signals like the MACD indicator can be useful, it is important to prioritize long-term strategies to maximize profit potential over time.

Considering the current market conditions and the emphasis on long-term strategies, I would take a conservative trading approach and hold onto my ETH investments. I believe that despite the recent downward trend, there may be a potential reversal in the near future, aligning with the positive long-term outlook for cryptocurrencies like Solana. Therefore, my trading action would be to hold onto my ETH investments with a confidence level of 0.5, indicating a moderate level of confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.
ACTION:
0.5
DAILY RETURN:

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain, news, and reflection analyst reports, it is clear that the market sentiment for ETH is currently bearish, with a downward trend in open prices and fluctuating transaction volumes. The mixed sentiment in the news, along with potential volatility ahead due to key events like the US Federal Reserve meeting and developments in Solana-based projects, adds to the uncertainty in the market.

However, the reflection analyst report highlights the importance of long-term strategies and a conservative trading approach to maximize profit potential and manage risk effectively. It emphasizes the need to consider potential reversals in trends and prioritize long-term potential over short-term gains.

Taking into account the synthesized reports, it is advisable to adopt a cautious approach and focus on long-term strategies for trading ETH. While short-term fluctuations may occur, the overall positive long-term outlook for cryptocurrencies like ETH suggests that holding onto investments and waiting for potential reversals in the market could lead to more successful outcomes.

Therefore, I would take a slightly conservative approach and assign a trading action of 0.3, indicating moderate confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately by prioritizing long-term potential over short-term gains.

Now, they say it’s all about making distribution as cheap as possible in order to attract as many people as possible to the market.\n\nIlja Moisejevs and Richard Wu talk to Blockworks on the Lightspeed podcast (Spotify/Apple) about the highly efficient approach to digital asset creation and how it will change the market.\n\nExplained in detail on Solana’s official website, a compressed NFT uses “state compression,” which “takes advantage of Merkle trees” to reduce the required data into a “hash” or “fingerprint,” stored in the Solana ledger.\n\n“It’s the cheapest possible way in crypto to create an NFT,” says Moisejevs.\n\nConsumer behavior all goes back to cost, he says. Whether it’s calling an Uber, staying in an AirBnB or skipping the dishes, behaviors change when things are cheaper. Making assets cost next to nothing enables a broad range of new distribution models and expands the market’s potential size, Moisejevs says.\n\nTensor is among the first pioneers to test out compressed NFTs, so the founders have developed a few ideas regarding their use-cases. “These will be used without thought in every single crypto consumer app at some point,” Wu says confidently.\n\nWu says compressed NFTs unlock the ability for consumer applications to experiment with possibilities, freed from the burden of creation costs. The boost in efficiency has sparked a variety of new possibilities, he says.\n\nDialect, a wallet-to-wallet messaging app, he says as an example, offers the ability to send and receive collectible NFT “stickers.” Even though the minting cost is negligible, “it’s still worth something,” Wu says, “because there’s a limited quantity and you can trade them back and forth.”\n\nDrip Haus airdrops NFTs in the thousands for free to subscribers — an impossibility for creators on the Ethereum side of the digital asset equation. “Think about any consumer app in Web2 that’s remotely useful, that has some notion of something that you could perhaps own, something that you could perhaps collect and show off,” Wu says.\n\n“All of these will eventually use NFTs,” he says. “It only makes sense for them to use compressed NFTs because of the cost.”\n\nAdded complexities\n\nMoisejevs admits that the compression technology adds complexity to the developer experience, requiring “very close cooperation” between the RPC provider and the app-builder. The two parties are “constantly going back and forth and resolving issues,” he says, “because this technology spans the infrastructure stack as much as it spans the app stack.”\n\n“You really need these two teams working in tandem. When it comes to a solo developer that just wants to spin up a fun little app for a hackathon, this is going to be a lot harder to do than it would be to do with normal NFTs.”\n\nWu notes that, as is often the case with low-cost platforms, spam will be an issue that needs to be addressed by developers. “They’re so cheap to make, people don’t even think about how much it costs to send someone one of these compressed NFTs or to create a thousand compressed NFTs.”\n\n“People will be getting thousands, tens of thousands of these compressed NFTs,” he says, which will be a technical challenge for wallet and RPC providers. Marketplaces like Tensor will need to index and surface the NFTs efficiently while hiding spam. “That’s going to be very difficult.”\n\nWu sees compressed NFT tech as a means to expand the market’s audience. “What we need is to find a way to bring more users into the space to actually proliferate NFTs and the idea of digital assets so that your relatives, friends at Thanksgiving dinner, will actually be interested in NFTs.”\n\n“A lot of crypto is just speculation right now,” and while that’s “keeping the wheels turning,” he says, “it’s not something that is exciting in the long term.”\n\n“It’s fun for now, but we need to grow beyond just speculation.”\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

The altcoin remains below a strong resistance level, but a potential breakthrough could lead to a 20% price appreciation.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nPEPE Whales Load Up Their Bags As Memecoin Jumps 13% 9 months ago\n\nIn the last 24 hours, SOL saw a modest surge of 2.2%, but its performance on the weekly chart shows minimal upward movement. Despite the challenges, there are two essential bullish signals to consider: the morning star reversal sign and a bullish pennant formation.\n\nThese signals suggest that if SOL surpasses the immediate resistance, the coin might aim for a rally back to levels it reached two weeks ago. In the broader market context, Bitcoin’s re-entry into the $29,000 price level has caused retracements in altcoins on their respective charts.\n\nTherefore, for SOL to surpass the immediate resistance, it will require strong support from the broader market. The market capitalization of SOL has also experienced a decline, indicating a slight weakening in buying strength.\n\nSolana Price Analysis: One-Day Chart'}, {'id': 2, 'time': 'Fri, 28 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'What is Solana? A Scalable, Decentralized Network for Dapps - Yahoo Finance', 'content': "Decentralized applications, or dapps, are widely regarded as one of the key use cases for blockchain technology.\n\nIn the last few years, dapps have come on in leaps and bounds, with dapp developers launching everything from games to decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms on blockchain—and a concomitant explosion in user interest.\n\nBut there's a problem. The vast majority of these dapps run on Ethereum, which has struggled to keep up with rampant demand—leading to congestion on the network and soaring transaction fees.\n\nNow Solana, a blockchain platform that had its beginnings in 2017, is aiming to step into the breach, and succeed where Ethereum is currently struggling.\n\nWhat is Solana?\n\nSolana is an advanced open-source blockchain project that looks to leverage several breakthrough technologies to power the next generation of dapps.\n\nThe project is focused on providing a highly scalable, secure, and maximally decentralized platform that can support potentially thousands of nodes without sacrificing throughput—helping to avoid some of the challenges faced by competing systems.\n\nIt was founded in 2017 during the ICO boom and raised more than $25 million across various private and public sale rounds. The platform went to mainnet in March 2020, but is still operating as a beta release.\n\nHow does Solana work?\n\nOne of Solana’s key distinguishing features is its Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus system, which is reinforced by something known as Tower Consensus. This is a variant of a system that enables distributed networks to reach consensus despite attacks from malicious nodes, known as Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT).\n\nSolana's implementation of PBFT enforces a global source of time across the blockchain through a second novel protocol known as Proof of History (PoH). This essentially provides a chronicle of previous events on the blockchain, ensuring that there's a common record of what happened and when for permanent reference.\n\nTower Consensus leverages this synchronized clock to reduce the processing power needed to verify transactions, since the timestamps of previous transactions no longer need to be computed. This helps Solana achieve a throughput that dwarfs most competitors (more on this later).\n\nBeyond this, Solana includes a number of other innovations that help it stand out from the competition. Among these is its transaction parallelization technology, known as Sealevel. This allows for a parallel smart contracts runtime that optimizes resources and ensures that Solana can scale horizontally across GPUs and SSDs, which should help the platform scale to meet demands.\n\nStory continues\n\nSolana also completely nixes the mempool system used by other platforms, and instead forwards transactions to validators even before the previous batch of transactions is finalized. This helps to maximize confirmation speed and boost the number of transactions that can be handled both concurrently and in parallel. This technology is known as 'Gulf Stream'.\n\nWhat's so special about it?\n\nWhen it comes to decentralized applications, speed matters. As is evidenced by the bottlenecks currently faced by the Ethereum network. Solana, however, doesn't currently suffer from these issues due to its high throughput architecture.\n\nSolana claims that its blockchain is capable of sustaining more than 50,000 transactions per second (TPS) at peak load, which would make it arguably the fastest blockchain currently operating. To put this into perspective, this is close to 1,000 times faster than Bitcoin (max throughput ~5-7 TPS) and more than 3,000 times faster than Ethereum (max throughput ~15 TPS).\n\nMoreover, Solana claims an average block time of 400 to 800 milliseconds and an average transaction fee of 0.000005 SOL (or a tiny fraction of one cent). This, combined with its massive scalability, makes it well-positioned to serve up decentralized applications that can support potentially tens of thousands of simultaneous users without buckling under the load.\n\nSolana achieves this scalability without resorting to second-layer or off-chain technologies and doesn't use any form of sharding. This makes it one of the few layer 1 blockchains capable of achieving more than 1,000 TPS.\n\nUnlike some platforms, practically anybody can get up and running with a Solana validator and help to secure the network. The process is completely permissionless, though users will need to maintain some basic hardware to participate—namely a server that meets the minimum specifications outlined here. In total, the network currently boasts close to 1,000 validators, making it one of the more widely distributed blockchains.\n\nWhat is the SOL token?\n\nSolana, like the vast majority of smart contract platforms, features its own native gas token — known as SOL. As the gas token, all transactions and smart contract operations on Solana will consume SOL.\n\nThe SOL token can also be staked to help support the security of the network, allowing users to earn a prop..."}]

She started in February.\n\nThe Milwaukee Food Council is a nonprofit dedicated to building a food system that is sustainable, healthy and community driven.\n\nFood equity\n\nIn its early years, the council was involved in legalizing ownership of chickens and beekeeping within city limits. Recently, the organization has focused efforts on drafting large-scale food system strategies on issues such as food waste and equitable food access.\n\nWith the hiring of Patterson-Ramos and seven new additions to the board of directors this year, the organization seeks to build its capacity for community engagement with people who are not already involved in food-system advocacy.\n\n“Education and community outreach is my thing,” she said.\n\nThe Milwaukee Food Council will be Patterson-Ramos’ first role that is explicitly about food security.\n\n“Going through the interview process, I realized how much my views on the food system ties into everything I do,” she said.\n\nA history of outreach\n\nPatterson-Ramos has held communications and outreach roles in organizations such as MKE Black, Citizen Action Wisconsin, the Milwaukee branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nShe also has worked in several political campaigns for state and local offices, including her own campaign for Milwaukee County supervisor in 2015.\n\nIn all of these roles, Patterson-Ramos says there is common theme: getting reliable and digestible information to people for events or causes that matter.\n\nDanielle Nabak, who joined the Milwaukee Food Council in 2017 and sits on the council’s board of directors, said Patterson-Ramos stood out in the hiring process because of her “lived experience with inequities in the food system.”\n\nPatterson-Ramos “has a lot of experience building from the ground up,” Nabak said. “Our mission is to build a food system that is community-driven, and we’re excited about engaging new folks.”\n\nA lifetime of service\n\nFor Patterson-Ramos, service comes naturally.\n\nAs a kid growing up in multiple neighborhoods on both the north and south sides of Milwaukee, her mom instilled in her the viewpoint that community service was not a special act but “just something you do.”\n\n“I come from a low-income household, and I remember going to the soup kitchen (for meals) but also volunteering in it,” she said.\n\nBut if you met her while she was attending Bradley Tech High School or in her early college days at UW-Milwaukee, she would probably have told you that she was destined for a career in electrical engineering. It was her focus in high school and her first declared major.\n\nHowever, Patterson-Ramos remembers attending an out-of-town convention for the Society of Black Engineers in college that shifted her focus toward community outreach and education.\n\n“Seeing all these Black and Brown people suited and booted and just seeing how a Black organization works, I came back pumped to do whatever I could (to) give people the help they needed to thrive and graduate,” she said.\n\nReaching out\n\nPatterson-Ramos sees community outreach as a necessary ingredient for building a just and equitable society.\n\nShe said that often there is an assumption that people don’t care about an issue, when in reality they are simply unaware.\n\n“A lot of times people just don’t know who’s involved or who they should talk to,” she said. “And a lot of times that’s because communication isn’t the best.\n\n“If you don’t have a Facebook event, an Eventbrite, a press release and all that, how are people going to know about it?”\n\n“There’s a lot of tools in the toolbox for fighting oppression, and education is one of those tools,” she said.\n\n\xad\xad\xad\xadRick Banks said he met Patterson-Ramos at a conference his first year in college.\n\n“I remember thinking: ‘Wow. This woman is really passionate, informed and knowledgeable and creative,’” he said.\n\nEver since, the two have made a dynamic duo, whether on student government and other groups at UW-Milwaukee, working on political campaigns (including each other’s) and on developing MKE Black, a business directory focused on Milwaukee’s Black-owned businesses.\n\nUnapologetically herself\n\nAlthough Patterson-Ramos takes pride in her work, she also is equally proud of what she does outside of it.\n\nShe’s worked in multiple haunted houses for about 10 years, including at Six Flags and Hauntfest.\n\nShe’s also an avid cosplayer and gamer. She takes part in tournaments at the annual Midwest Gaming Classic, and used to be involved in Anime Milwaukee.\n\nOn top of all that, she’s taking care of four cats.\n\n“I do a lot of random stuff, man,” she said. “Outside of the work, I’m a geek.”\n\nFor more information\n\nBoth Nabak and Patterson-Ramos said that the best way to get involved and stay up to...'}, {'id': 2, 'time': 'Sat, 29 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Intra-annual density fluctuations in tree rings are proxies of air temperature across Europe | Scientific Reports - Nature.com', 'content': 'This study is the first to analyze IADFs frequency across a broad network of sites representing a large range of climatic conditions and diverse woody species in Europe. A previous study29 analyzed IADFs frequency in three Pinus species across Italy and the Iberian Peninsula. The present network includes 89 sites and 11 different species, and it is climatologically representative (in terms of mean annual precipitation and temperature) of 4 cluster groups spanning from semi-arid to temperate. The network over-represents the Mediterranean area, where the occurrence of IADFs has been studied much more intensively, and under-represents the northernmost areas of Europe, where IADF studies are less common17. We took this over- and under-representation into account by applying weight-adjusted analyses in the GAM model and the interpretation of the results. Further, the limited number of angiosperm samples has been considered in the model with species-specific coefficients regarding temperature, precipitation and SPEI, thus our findings are not dependent on the limited number of samples for angiosperm species. Our findings confirm those of previous studies: for all studied species, the predisposition to form IADFs depends on tree age29,30 and tree-ring width17,21,31. In particular, all analyzed species show relatively high IADFs frequencies (> 50%, Fig. 2) in wider rings, which has also been reported in studies on pine species11,29,32,33,34,35. Wide rings are often associated with favorable conditions for tree growth and a longer growing season20,24,29,36. In wider rings, more cells are under differentiation for a longer period, which makes the presence of IADFs more likely as long as the triggering factors occur31,37.\n\nThe uneven spatial distribution of the species in our IADFs network must be taken into account when looking at spatial patterns in IADFs frequency. Nevertheless, the results clearly indicate that some species, such as P. abies, L. decidua, and P. halepensis, are more prone to IADFs formation than others. High IADFs frequencies have already been reported in gymnosperms growing in temperate climates (e.g., L. decidua and P. abies in Poland38,39), where IADFs occurrence is linked to weather fluctuations occurring during the second part of the growing season40,41. IADFs in these species may contribute to safer water transport during climate fluctuations42, allowing those species to be more plastic and responsive to climate39. On the other hand, P. halepensis is the most widely distributed Mediterranean pine species and is well-adapted to growing under xeric conditions43. Several studies have found that P. halepensis experiences a summer reduction in tree growth followed by a reactivation of cambial activity during rainy autumns, which often leads to the formation of IADFs16,27,29,35,44,45,46. Although the occurrence of IADFs is not related to one single environmental factor, since their formation can be influenced by altitude, aspect, tree species, tree state, tree age, and total ring width20,21,29,34,38,47, our network analysis indicates that the formation of IADFs in the majority of species depends primarily on warm growing season temperatures (Fig. 5, Table 1). High temperatures such as those recorded in the last decades can induce stomata closure at all canopy levels, especially when coupled with intense drought events48. Such events might also force trees to adapt their phenology and start growing earlier in spring49,50. In those conditions, trees can anticipate growth onset to take advantage of favorable conditions (i.e., day length, temperature) and maximize growth rates before the start of summer drought51. However, anticipating the onset of the growing season has an associated risk: high temperatures during spring and summer drought events6. Thus, the longer growing seasons observed at several Mediterranean sites are associated with two main growth peaks interrupted by the drought-induced cessation of summer growth44. This bimodal growth pattern is also associated with the formation of IADFs and has been reported in several conifer species (P. halepensis16,44,45,52,53; P. pinaster33,40,54; J. thurifera46,55; P. pinea11) and in several hardwood species (Q. ilex56; A. unedo25,57). In A. unedo, an evergreen broadleaf, and P. abies, an evergreen conifer, total annual precipitation seems to play an important role in IADF formation. Indeed, we found a higher frequency of IADFs when precipitation is low. Evergreen broadleaved trees grow primarily in the very dry and warm areas of the Mediterranean and suffer from water shortage during summer6,25. A. unedo in particular strongly reduces its hydraulic conductivity and photosynthetic activity during dry years, and invests stored carbohydrates in structures that guarantee tree survival6. Thus, IADFs may be produced to guarantee sufficient mechanical strength against cavitation, and hydraulic safety by modifying tracheid dimensions and pit morphology. On t...'}]

These digital currencies have shattered convention, leaving an indelible mark on the financial markets, worldwide. But beyond their market impact, they represent a profound paradigm shift that challenges the very foundations of traditional finance.As we navigate this complex landscape, one question persists: Can cryptocurrencies truly reshape the future of finance and payments or are they merely another fleeting trend in the vast sea of technological advancements?Cryptocurrencies provide a solution to the limitations of traditional financial systems in our increasingly borderless world. Foreign exchange fees, long transfer times, and high transaction costs have long been pain points for businesses and individuals alike. While conventional wire transfers can take up to 5 days to settle, cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Stellar, and Solana offer transaction times ranging from mere seconds to a few milliseconds. This enhanced speed not only improves business flexibility but also facilitates improved cash flow.Transaction fees further exacerbate the challenges faced by businesses operating in traditional financial systems.Consider this scenario: You want to send Rs 1 lakh to your friend in the US. In a traditional financial system, the transaction cost, including fees, could add up to a hefty Rs 10,000. However, cryptocurrency solutions such as Arbitrum and Polygon charge less than $0.10 per transaction, and networks like Solana settle for less than a cent.This significant difference in transaction fees makes cryptocurrency payments an incredibly attractive alternative to traditional methods, especially for businesses with high revenue volumes or tight profit margins. By adopting cryptocurrency payments, enterprises can eliminate the typical 2-3% transaction fees associated with card payments, saving substantial amounts of money.Not only do cryptocurrencies offer benefits to businesses, but they also present a boon for global migrants who rely on remittances.A crucial indicator of the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies is that nearly 1 in 10 Indian adults are now actively participating in the cryptocurrency economy. This increase in participation underscores a significant shift in public sentiment and mirrors the escalating acceptance of digital assets. As the notion of a decentralized currency earns more advocates, we're setting the stage for a more extensive adoption of cryptocurrencies in everyday transactions.Another significant supporter of cryptocurrencies comes from the towering pillars of the global financial institutions. These historically risk-averse organizations are now beginning to acknowledge cryptocurrencies as a legitimate asset class. This shift significantly enhances the credibility of digital currencies and strengthens their standing in the financial landscape.Notable businesses like Tesla PayPal , Starbucks, Overstock , and AT&T have started accepting cryptocurrencies, underscoring their growing influence across diverse sectors. This isn't a fleeting trend; it's a testament to the tangible benefits of digital currencies. Their widespread adoption indicates that cryptocurrencies are here to stay, reinforcing their place in our financial ecosystem.However, the adoption of cryptocurrency payments and remittances faces three key barriers that must be overcome.The first is infrastructure, as payment recipients must be able to convert crypto payments into their local currencies and spend them. This requires integrations with commercial banks, which can be a slow and arduous process, given the significant number of banks worldwide. Secondly, education is crucial, as many potential users remain skeptical or uninformed about cryptocurrencies and how to use them effectively.This is particularly true for consumers among the unbanked population who would benefit the most from crypto payments. Lastly, regulation remains a challenge. While some countries are embracing cryptocurrencies, others have cracked down hard on the sector, leading to uncertainty and caution among potential users.Despite these hurdles, the adoption of cryptocurrency payments and remittances is well underway. As more and more local vendors begin accepting cryptocurrencies as payment for goods and services, the need for banking and payment partners to integrate becomes irrelevant. Visa and Mastercard have recognized this trend and swiftly embraced blockchain technology to avoid irrelevancy.As we gaze towards the horizon, it is evident that cryptocurrencies were always destined to bring about a revolution in the world of payments. Their growing integration into our global economy and financial system underscores this vision. Cryptocurrencies are primed to bring about a significant shift in the global payments ecosystem. Their sustained growth and adoption indicate that they are ..."}]

But blockchains typically have one major downside compared to centralized networks like the ones credit-card companies use: they’re slow. As of August 2021, Ethereum typically processes fewer than 15 transactions per second, compared to tens of thousands for Visa’s network.\n\nSolana is one of many new crypto solutions aiming to make crypto networks faster and more scalable. It uses a suite of clever technologies, including a novel mechanism called “proof of history.”\n\nWho Created Solana (SOL)?\n\nSolana was first conceptualized by Anatoly Yakovenko in 2017, who sought a decentralized network of nodes that could match the performance of a single node. The Solana blockchain is guided by Solana Labs as a core contributor, while also being supported by the Solana Foundation, a Swiss-based non-profit dedicated to growing the community and funding development.\n\nYakovenko and his team began receiving funds in 2018 as part of Solana Labs. The team privately raised over $20 million in a Series A that spanned several months into 2019. After its mainnet launch in March 2020, Solana raised an additional $1.76 million in a public token sale carried out by cryptocurrency auction.\n\nHow Does Solana Work?\n\nThe Solana network offers many features common to other cryptocurrency networks such as smart contracting, transaction settlement, and token issuance. However, to distinguish itself from others, Solana hopes to offer better settlement speeds and a higher capacity for transactions.\n\nSolana Network Architecture\n\nSolana aims to achieve scalability through it’s network design and operates with eight core components to do so:\n\nProof-of-History – Global clock referenced to create a common schedule across all participants.\n\nGulf Stream – Defines when and how transactions are exchanged.\n\nSealevel – Processing engine that assigns the order and execution of transactions.\n\nTurbine – Defines how nodes validate transactions (also known as validators) send and receive blocks.\n\nCloudbreak – Memory mechanism used to keep track of participant balances\n\nPipeline – Verifies each component of a transaction.\n\nArchivers – Network of nodes where data is off-loaded from validators and stored in perpetuity.\n\nWhile technologically complex and intricate, each component is meant to optimize the amount of transactions Solana can execute without sharding its chain or using a layer 2 network.\n\nSolana Delegated Proof-of-Stake Consensus\n\nTo secure its blockchain, Solana created a consensus mechanism called Tower BFT that incorporates what is commonly referred to as delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS).\n\nDPoS uses a voting and reputation system to secure the network, validate transactions, and distribute newly minted SOL, meaning that anyone who owns SOL tokens (sometimes referred to as SOL coins) can help operate the network.\n\nEach SOL token can be locked, or “staked,” by participants (“nodes”) to both participate in governance and increase the chances of being chosen to produce blocks.\n\nParticipants can also choose to delegate their SOL to other validators, allocating votes to them while earning a portion of the block rewards.\n\nWhy Does SOL Coin Have Value?\n\nThe SOL cryptocurrency plays a key role in maintaining and operating the Solana ecosystem.\n\nSolana rewards validators and delegators with a portion of the newly minted SOL along with transaction fees based on the amount of SOL staked, the set inflation rate, and the complexity and amount of transactions on the network.\n\nBy owning SOL tokens, users can also access the suite of projects that have been built on the Solana network.\n\nSimilar to Ethereum, Solana enables developers to run custom smart contracts and design decentralized applications (dapps) to offer digitized products and services. Examples include Serum, an order-book style decentralized exchange service, and Raydium, an automated market maker (AMM) that provides liquidity to its ecosystem.\n\nWhy Use Solana (SOL)?\n\nUsers may find Solana appealing based on its attempt to create a scalable platform for decentralized applications without implementing sharding or second-layer technologies.\n\nFurther, developers may find the platform attractive for products and services that warrant a high volume of activity. Investors may seek to buy SOL and add it to their portfolio if they believe the market will one day favor more scalable blockchains.\n\nWhere Can You Buy SOL?\n\nYou can buy, trade, and deposit XRP tokens at the LCX exchange. The trading pairs for XRP tokens are: SOL/EUR & SOL/LCX'}]

The cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, experienced a decline with Bitcoin dropping below $29,000 and Ethereum below $1,850.

They’re replaced with a different set of constraints, of course,” he admits.\n\nChen talks to Blockworks on the 0XResearch podcast (Spotify/Apple) about how the vision for fully on-chain DeFi remains a strong possibility.\n\n“We are still quite early on the infrastructure side,” Chen says, “but as a DeFi protocol designer, there’s just so much more you can do when you don’t have to deal with 10 or 20 [transactions per second].”\n\nThe high throughput and low fees that are characteristic of Solana’s ecosystem allow “active participation in the market,” he says. Chen mentions Ellipsis Labs-developed Phoenix, a fully on-chain, non-custodial decentralized limit-order book, as an example. New limit-orders, cancellations and trades take place 5 to 10 times per second on the platform as of now.\n\n“We’re still in the very early stages here. So we expect that number to go up pretty significantly as the markets become more competitive and as more users come on.”\n\n“This is just not possible on a chain that does 10 or 20 [transactions per second],” he says. “You are not going to have 10 [transactions per second] going through a single DEX, or if you are, the cost is going to be prohibitive.”\n\nMarket makers on Phoenix update orders every second or faster, Chen says, paying around $20 per day in costs — “which is like the cost of one ‘add liquidity’ or ‘remove liquidity’ on Uniswap V3.”\n\nPrice discovery happens off-chain\n\nChen explains that DeFi automated market makers (AMMs) were born out of speed and cost constraints. “You don’t need your market makers to be updating their quotes super frequently. You set it and forget it. And I think that really was quite innovative.”\n\nBut the liquidity provided by AMMs is not competitive with off-chain limit-order books, according to Chen. This is why, he says, price discovery takes place off-chain on centralized exchanges.\n\n“The price discovery is happening on these venues that don’t have 12 second block times, where market makers can put the liquidity exactly where they want to,” he says.\n\nChen admits that on-chain DeFi has a long way to go. “There are a ton of concerns with MEV and discrete block times in the same way that these are pretty big challenges for AMMs to overcome.”\n\nChen notes that the “vanilla limit-order book” implemented on Phoenix is not yet good enough to be the “final form of DeFi liquidity,” but is a “much better starting point than the AMM.”\n\nThe AMM design space is “fairly restricted,” according to Chen. “Especially when you’re on Ethereum mainnet.”\n\n“I do expect to see a lot more innovation in DEX design as more and more DeFi activity on the Ethereum side moves to [layer-2s], and I’m pretty excited to see that.”\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

Since the start of the year, the price has surged 129%. After a strong rebound from its June Lows, SOL price is currently having a major pullback. This pullback might turn out to be very healthy for the smart contract cryptocurrency. Let me explain how.\n\nOn Thursday, cryptocurrencies continued their downtrend as the BTC price once again plummeted below $29,000. This intensified the sell-off in altcoin markets, sending most of them below their June lows. SOL crypto also showed a negative price action and was down 1.05% till press time.\n\nSOL Crypto TVL Fails To Impress\n\nDespite a massive rally in SOL right from the start of this year, the total locked value (TVL) hasn’t seen a similar increase. The TVL on the smart contract platform has increased only 50% as compared to the 129% surge in Solana price.\n\nOffsetting the effect of the price surge, these stats show an outflow of other coins from the Solana blockchain. The holders could have moved these funds to a different blockchain. Nevertheless, extremely impressive price action this year suggests that Solana is finally ready to recover by putting behind its FTX ties.\n\nSolana Price Prediction Remains Bullish\n\nAlthough SOL crypto has slid more than 31% from its July highs, it is yet to make a lower low on the daily chart. This bullish market structure will remain intact until the price closes a day below $20.43. Till then, I’ll keep finding good setups to go long.\n\nSolana price prediction might flip extremely bullish if the coin gains strength above the $25 level. It broke above this level last month but couldn’t reclaim it. A lot depends on the BTC price action in the coming days. If BTC breaks above $31,000, altcoins like SOL might follow.\n\nIn the meantime, I’ll keep sharing updated Solana analysis and my personal trades on my Twitter, where you are welcome to follow me.'}, {'id': 7, 'time': 'Thu, 03 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Solana: Long-term investors can look to this level - AMBCrypto News', 'content': 'Disclaimer: The information presented does not constitute financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice and is solely the writer’s opinion.\n\nSolana has a strongly bullish outlook on the higher timeframe price charts.\n\nThe retracement into a weekly region of interest meant buyers can look for opportunities to enter the market.\n\nSolana [SOL] has registered strong gains since the fall to $15 in mid-June. Prices climbed as high as $32 on 10 July, although the bulls were unable to hold on to the $30 level thereafter.\n\nRead Solana’s [SOL] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nThe presence of a demand zone just below $22 from the weekly timeframe meant it was a place where a bullish reversal could occur. Bitcoin [BTC] and SOL both have a bearish short-term outlook. Can we see some more losses followed by a rally for Solana?\n\nThe confluence of breaker and Fib retracement presented a zone of interest for the buyers\n\nOn the 3-day chart, the price action has a bullish structure. The move past the previous lower high at $22.3 reached $32.13, signaling firm bullish intent. A set of Fibonacci retracement levels (yellow) were plotted based on the move from $12.8 to $32.13.\n\nIt showed the 50% and 61.8% retracement levels sat at $22.47 and $20.18 respectively. Moreover, on the weekly timeframe, a bullish breaker block was seen that extended from $20.26 to $22.3. This had confluence with the Fib levels too.\n\nTherefore, buyers can look to bid SOL after the price enters this zone. A lower timeframe bullish market structure break within this zone can give buyers an opportunity. Meanwhile, a move below the $18.32 level would invalidate this idea.\n\nThe OBV saw a large uptick in late June and July but has pulled back a bit over the past three weeks. Overall, the buying volume was still dominant. The RSI also showed bullish momentum with a reading of 56.\n\nThe lower timeframe SOL charts continued to show bearish pressure\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Solana Profit Calculator\n\nData from Coinalyze showed that Open Interest saw a sharp drop on 30 July as the price fell from $25 to $23.5. This suggested bearish sentiment, which was compounded on 31 July when the OI rose alongside falling prices. The spot CVD was also in a downtrend.\n\nThe rising OI signaled strong bearishness, and the lack of demand meant Solana prices were headed lower in the near term. This could see SOL drop to the $22 demand zone.'}, {'id': 2, 'time': 'Thu, 03 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Proof-of-History Explained - LCX', 'content': 'Blockchain technology has revolutionized our conceptions of trust and security in the digital era, allowing decentralized networks to function without intermediaries. However, scalability is a significant obstacle for Blockchain networks, mainly when processing numerous transactions swiftly and securely. Proof of History (PoH) comes into play here. PoH is a novel consensus mechanism devised by Solana Labs that generates timestamps for each block in the Blockchain using a cryptographic function called the Verifiable Delay Function (VDF). By ensuring the immutability and authenticity of these timestamps, Proof-of-History can considerably enhance the efficiency and security of Blockchain networks, especially those that require high transaction throughput and quick finalization.\n\nConsidering Proof of History’s operational efficacy, it will likely emerge as the leading consensus mechanism for developing decentralized financial systems. It bolsters the significance of Proof of History for Blockchain engineers and architects working on Web3-based DApp ecosystems. This article will describe Proof of History, its operation, its benefits, and its potential to revolutionize the Blockchain industry.\n\nWhat Is Proof-of-History?\n\nProof of History (PoH) is a novel consensus mechanism devised by the founder of Solana Labs, Anatoly Yakovenko. PoH is based on the premise that the order of events in a Blockchain network is just as significant as the events themselves, and the ability to establish the order of events is essential to maintaining the network’s integrity. To accomplish this, PoH generates a timestamp for each block in the Blockchain using a cryptographic Verifiable Delay Function (VDF).\n\nThe VDF is designed to be delay-hard and memory-hard, making it challenging for adversaries to manipulate timestamps. Incorporating the timestamp generated by the VDF into each block of the Blockchain provides a verifiable and immutable record of the order in which transactions occurred. PoH permits rapid finality, which means that once a block is added to the Blockchain, it is deemed final and cannot be undone.\n\nPoH is predominantly utilized in the Solana Blockchain network, which was designed to be highly scalable and capable of processing thousands of transactions per second. PoH can increase the efficiency and speed of the Solana network by reducing the amount of storage and bandwidth required to maintain the blockchain while also providing a secure and verifiable record of transactions.\n\nCore Principles of Proof-of-History\n\nVerifiability: PoH ensures that the historical record is transparent, immutable, and publicly accessible. Anyone can independently verify the timestamps generated by the PoH mechanism, thus establishing trust and reducing the need for heavy computational processes.\n\nDecentralization: PoH is designed to operate in a decentralized manner, allowing multiple nodes to generate and validate timestamps concurrently. This ensures that no single entity has control over the generation of timestamps, enhancing the security and reliability of the blockchain network.\n\nEfficiency: PoH significantly improves the efficiency of blockchain networks by eliminating the need for computationally expensive consensus algorithms, such as PoW. With a reliable temporal order of events, nodes can more efficiently process transactions, achieve consensus, and validate blocks, resulting in faster throughput and reduced transaction fees.'}]

The news articles suggest a mixed outlook for Solana (SOL) in the cryptocurrency market. While one article highlights the bullish long-term potential of SOL based on technical analysis and demand zones, another article discusses the current pullback in SOL price and the need for a bullish breakout above key levels to confirm a positive trend. Additionally, the explanation of Proof-of-History as a consensus mechanism for Solana indicates the potential for enhanced efficiency and security in the blockchain network.

Moreover, she recently took to Instagram with a new photo dump that had fans going wild in their replies. As one fan rightfully pointed out, "Posting mad random s**t looking mad good smh," as she typically does with her potential thirst trap content. In the first image, the 33-year-old basks in the sun in a cream and brown-colored bikini, showing off her abs and body to many\'s delight. Most people were blown away by her physique and charmed instantly by her fun collection of snaps, with Benny Blanco commenting, "it’s always summer when u r solana."\n\nFurthermore, the TDE signer also included a hoodied-up pic in the studio with sweatpants and a cap on, hopefully hinting at something dropping soon. In addition, she does the splits in front of an art piece, poses with Homer and Lisa Simpson statues, and gets in front of a strange and futuristic mirror that looks like the chrome future from that one SpongeBob episode. Finally, there\'s an intense game of Jenga captured in real time with engineer Hector Castro.

Regardless, she has been spending a lot of time in the studio lately, whether just for fun or actively working on a release. Whatever the case, she can do whatever she wants after the last album\'s success. In any case, Solana has us engaged no matter what with content like this.\n\nMeanwhile, her recent feature alongside Future on Travis Scott\'s "TELEKINESIS" might mean that there\'s even more to come.

In a CNBC interview, Gokal labeled Robinhood and other exchanges that took the same step as crypto “tourists.” He also weighed in on ongoing efforts to bring clarity to the U.S. crypto industry.\n\nRecall that Robinhood, with an estimated 23 million users, delisted SOL in June. The crypto asset was tagged alongside others as securities by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance. Although the Solana co-founder hesitated to comment on the ongoing court case, he reckoned that the Robinhood delisting was not a significant concern for the Solana Foundation.\n\nThe Solana co-founder said, “I think it’s pretty understandable for U.S. businesses that are not primarily crypto businesses [to delist SOL]. We see this in every market cycle: crypto tourists and businesses that have very small product lines in crypto and kind of recede when it gets hot in the kitchen. My understanding of folks like Robinhood and other products is that these were really small product lines.” Focusing on the positives since the SEC saga with crypto exchanges, Raj Gokal added, “The more important thing is that folks like Coinbase, Binance, and other exchanges that represent the largest majority of trading volume and activity for users are not taking any meaningful action that limits consumer access to these assets. That’s great to see and what I expect to continue to see.”\n\nWe Want Clarity: Raj Gokal\n\nSolana’s co-founder also expressed optimism that the U.S. crypto industry is on the verge of getting regulatory clarity. According to Gokal, there are a lot of “positive signs” and “more legislative pressure to create more clear and actionable guidelines for how to operate in crypto.”\n\nHe continued, “We just want clarity. I think the lack of regulatory clarity has held the industry back for several years, and it seems we’re on the verge of getting that, hopefully from Congress.”\n\nRaj Gokal praised U.S. Congressmen Patrick McHenry, Ritchie Torres, and others who are promoting the need for clear regulations before lawmakers. He also singled out Coinbase for praise, lauding the exchange’s ongoing effort to provide clear guidelines to the emerging industry.'}, {'id': 6, 'time': 'Fri, 04 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Port3's SoQuest Platform Integrates With Solana, Announces 500M Gemstone Airdrop - CoinCodex", 'content': 'Key takeaways\n\nPort3 announces that SoQuest has now been integrated with Solana\n\nSoQuest Gemstone (SQT) tokens will soon be airdropped to the community\n\nPort3 has released a Gemstone Mining campaign that outlines the requirements for receiving the SQT airdrop\n\nPort3 has announced that its flagship product, SoQuest, has been integrated with the Solana network.

The network quickly garnered support from users and Dapp developers due to its performance and structure which enabled simultaneous smart contract executions. Today, the Solana ecosystem is a vibrant decentralized community.

Enter the intriguing world of NFT burning.\n\nAlso read: Dogecoin Army Buzzing with Anticipation After Elon Musk’s Tweet\n\nThis comprehensive guide will walk you through How to Burn a non-fungible token, including its purpose, steps on various blockchains, and implications for your digital asset’s future.\n\nSource: Information Age\n\nThe Art of NFT Destruction: Can NFTs Be Obliterated?\n\nNon-fungible tokens, once minted on the blockchain, become immutable digital assets.\n\nHowever, you can destroy or “burn” them through a process similar to sending the token into a digital black hole.\n\nThis act, known as “burning,” sends the token to an inaccessible, unspendable address, effectively wiping it from existence.\n\nAlso read: Shiba Inu: $1000 Investment on ShibaSwap Debut, Profit Revealed\n\nBurning an NFT: What Does It Entail?\n\nThe act of burning a non-fungible token is synonymous with completely deleting it. It involves the transfer of a token to an address that remains inaccessible to all.\n\nOnce a non-fungible token is burned, it is impossible to retrieve it. Hence, it is crucial to be sure that burning is your desired course of action.\n\nInterestingly, as the digital asset dissolves, its history and record remain imprinted on the blockchain, providing evidence of its existence and subsequent annihilation.\n\nThe Void Address: Understanding the Token Burn Address\n\nSource: Cointurk\n\nAn NFT burn address is a specialized wallet address that acts as a digital incinerator for tokens. Also known as an “address eater,” this null address is inaccessible and holds no keys.\n\nIt is the ultimate lock without a key.\n\nOn the Ethereum blockchain, the burn address is often represented as 0x0000000000000000000000000000dEaD.\n\nPolygon’s burn address appears as 0x0000000000000000000000000000, while Solana employs the burn address ‘ remove.sol.’\n\nDispatching an NFT to these addresses permanently eliminates it from circulation.\n\nThe Price of NFT Annihilation: Does Burning an NFT Cost Anything?\n\nYes, the process of burning an NFT incurs a cost.\n\nThis transaction fee, colloquially referred to as a “gas fee,” is required to process the burning of your non-fungible token.\n\nThe fee can fluctuate based on the current supply and demand on the blockchain.\n\nThe cost of burning an NFT can range anywhere from $0.00025 to $100.\n\nThe Step-by-Step Guide: How to Burn an NFT\n\nThe burning process is straightforward. Below is a step-by-step guide to burning your NFT on popular blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon.\n\nIncinerating an Ethereum NFT\n\nHere’s your guide on How to Burn an NFT on Ethereum:\n\nAccess the wallet or marketplace holding your NFT. Choose the NFT you wish to burn and hit the “Transfer” button. Direct your NFT to Ethereum’s official burn address, which is 0x00000000000000000000000000000000dEaD. Settle the required gas fees to transfer your NFT and click “Confirm.”\n\nWith these steps, your NFT will be permanently dissolved and removed from the marketplace. Remember, gas fees can vary based on supply and demand on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nBurning a Polygon NFT\n\nThe process of burning an NFT on the Polygon blockchain mirrors that of Ethereum, except for the burn address.\n\nHere’s how:\n\nNavigate to the item page for the NFT you wish to burn. Click on the transfer button. Enter the Polygon burn address: 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000. Hit “Transfer,” confirm the transaction with your wallet, pay the gas fees, and you’re done!\n\nObliterating a Solana NFT\n\nBurning an NFT on Solana differs slightly from other NFT blockchains.\n\nThe Phantom Wallet, a popular Solana wallet, has built-in burning features that reward users with SOL for burning certain NFTs.\n\nFor NFTs that aren’t supported by the built-in burning features, use the following steps:\n\nOpen your Solana wallet and locate the NFT you wish to burn. Add the ‘ remove.sol ‘ wallet address in the recipient field. Confirm the transaction and pay the associated gas fees.\n\nThe ‘remove.sol’ address is a graveyard for unwanted NFTs.\n\nOnce you send your NFT there, there’s no turning back; the burning process becomes irreversible.\n\nMonetary Compensation for Burning an NFT: Is It Possible?\n\nMonetary compensation for burning an NFT is platform-dependent.\n\nWhile Ethereum and Polygon offer no return, platforms like the Phantom Wallet provide a unique mechanism that rewards users with SOL for burning certain NFTs.\n\nHence, it’s advisable to check the specifics of the platform used to determine if it offers a reward.\n\nReasons to Burn an NFT: Why Would You Do It?\n\nThe act of burning an NFT serves several purposes.\n\nIt can be a strategic tool to control the value of an asset.

The Lowdown on SAND, WLD, AVAX & $INJ Unlocks and What They Mean Journal August Token Tremors? The Lowdown on SAND, WLD, AVAX & $INJ Unlocks and What They Mean Torsten Hartmann\n\nAugust is shaping up to be a pivotal month for several high-profile cryptocurrencies due to scheduled token unlocks. For crypto investors and enthusiasts, keeping an eye on these upcoming unlocks is essential to understand their potential impact on token prices and make informed decisions. This August, tokens worth hundreds of millions of dollars across projects like Sandbox ($SAND), Worldcoin ($WLD), Avalanche ($AVAX), Optimism ($OP), and Injective Protocol ($INJ) are set to be unlocked.\n\nWhile token unlocks inevitably increase supply and tend to create downward price pressure, their overall impact depends on various factors like the unlock amount, recipient details, project fundamentals, and market conditions.\n\nNew Meme Coin to Watch Aiming to be Next $BONK, $WIF or $MEW Milei Moneda is a new meme coin inspired by the political and economic views of Javier Milei, an Argentine president known for his libertarian and pro-Bitcoin stance. You have an opportunity with the ongoing low presale price to get in early! Sponsored Show more + Show less –\n\nHere’s a breakdown of what to expect and some insights to guide your decisions:\n\n1. $SAND – Unlocking on August 14th\n\n$SAND tokens worth $133.14M, which constitutes 16.16% of the circulating supply, are set to be unlocked. This hefty amount is primarily earmarked for the team, advisors, and key investors. Historically, advisors and investors tend to offload their tokens, so we might see some downward price pressure post-unlock. However, given that $SAND’s current price is hovering near its 2023 low, the market may have already factored this in.\n\n2. $WLD – A Potential Powder Keg?\n\nWorldcoin’s token, $WLD, is in a precarious position. Despite its market cap of $270M, its fully diluted valuation is a staggering $22.8B. A majority of the tokens set to enter circulation are community-allocated and team-governed. Notably, market makers hold sway over most of the existing circulating supply.\n\n3. $AVAX – Unlocking on August 26th\n\nTokens worth $118.7M, making up 2.76% of the circulating supply of $AVAX, will be unlocked. The primary recipients of these tokens will be the team and strategic collaborators. Previous unlocks have led to a short-lived dip in the $AVAX price, so history might repeat itself, but any impact is expected to be transient.\n\n4. $OP – Unlocking on August 30th\n\n$OP tokens valued at $41.3M, representing 3.37% of its circulating supply, are on the unlock radar. These are designated for investors and core contributors of the project. Given the current buzz surrounding $OP, a significant price dip post-unlock seems improbable. As someone deeply immersed in the crypto landscape, I’d advise against betting on a downturn.\n\n5. $INJ – Unlocking on August 21st\n\nCome August 21st, 3.41% of the $INJ circulating supply will be unleashed. These tokens, earmarked for “ecosystem development”, are likely to remain under team control. Should the team decide to liquidate these assets, it would likely be a gradual process spread over months. Some selling pressure is anticipated, but a drastic plunge seems unlikely.\n\nThere are a few ways that token unlocks can impact the price of a cryptocurrency token:\n\nSupply increase – Token unlocks usually refer to tokens that were initially locked up or restricted from being traded becoming freely tradable. This increases the circulating supply of the token, which could put downward pressure on the price if the new supply outpaces demand.\n\nSelling pressure – Founders, employees, investors etc whose tokens are unlocking may want to sell some or all of their newly tradable tokens to realize profits or get liquidity. This selling pressure could drive the price down.\n\nReduced scarcity – Locked tokens create artificial scarcity for a cryptocurrency, so unlocking them reduces this scarcity. Lower scarcity tends to lead to decreased prices.\n\nVesting schedules – Some token unlocks happen according to vesting schedules that space out the unlocking over time. This can minimize negative price impact vs a sudden, large unlock.\n\nPositive factors – In some cases token unlocks are indicative of progress being made by the project. This could actually boost confidence and offset selling pressures.\n\nOther fundamentals – Ultimately the impact on price will depend on overall token demand, use cases for the token, the wider crypto market conditions etc. The unlocking itself may not outweigh these other factors.\n\nToken unlocks tend to create downward pressure on price, all else being equal. But the overall price impact will vary depending on the specifics of the unlock and the project’s fundamentals. Monitoring the unlock schedule and amount can help gauge potential impacts.\n\nIn conclusion, August promises to be an eventful month for crypto aficionad...'}]

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
The upcoming token unlocks for SAND, WLD, AVAX, OP, and INJ in August are likely to create downward price pressure due to increased supply and potential selling pressure from advisors, investors, and team members. However, the impact on token prices will depend on various factors such as the unlock amount, recipient details, project fundamentals, and market conditions. While history suggests that previous unlocks have led to temporary price dips, the current market sentiment and buzz surrounding some of these projects may mitigate the negative impact.

Citing insider sources and leaked documents, news outlet Semafor revealed that X had contacted financial data giants to propose ideas for financial content and real-time stock data integration.\n\nThe app’s potential partners would gain access to a vast user base of “hundreds of millions of highly qualified users,” but X does not plan to offer monetary compensation. Instead, the interested firms were asked to indicate their investment commitment to the project.\n\nAlthough Elon Musk responded on X that there is no ongoing work related to the trading hub “to the best of my knowledge,” experts speculate that the service might be under consideration, although not necessarily imminent. This wouldn’t be the first time a trading hub idea has surfaced, as social investing platform eToro had previously hinted at offering trading services, including cryptocurrencies, to then-called Twitter users.\n\nIf the in-app trading hub plans proceed, given Musk’s affinity for digital assets, especially meme coin dogecoin (DOGE), the platform could potentially allow the trading of cryptocurrencies alongside other assets like Bitcoin (BTC), which could be viewed as a safer option from a regulatory standpoint. This notion is supported by recent news from Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, who revealed that regulators had requested him to halt trading in all cryptocurrencies except for bitcoin.\n\nAs unveiled in July during the platform’s rebranding, Elon Musk’s vision for X aims to create an all-encompassing everything-app akin to China’s WeChat, offering diverse services such as payments and gaming. The crypto community has responded positively to these developments, hailing the rebranding as a potential “game-changer” for the entire ecosystem.

The host’s bullish stance on Solana is based on four key points: Solana’s resilience, its thriving developer scene, its readiness to support groundbreaking projects, and its unique consumer strategy. Here’s a detailed breakdown of these points.\n\nSolana’s Resilience\n\nAccording to Coinsider, despite the collapse of FTX, Solana’s biggest supporter, the blockchain platform has shown remarkable resilience. The price of Solana dropped from $250 to around $10, a 96% drop, leading many to believe that Solana was dead. However, the host pointed out that Solana’s daily active addresses have held steady at around 300,000 for all of 2023, putting them on par with Ethereum and Polygon. Solana’s transaction volumes have also rebounded to pre-FTX levels, and it ranks fourth in terms of daily fees generated. These factors have contributed to a 150% surge in Solana’s price since January 2023, bringing it back into the top 10 on CoinMarketCap.\n\nThriving Developer Scene\n\nThe host highlighted that Solana’s developer scene is thriving, with the number of full-time developers ranking fourth amongst all blockchains. This means there are more developers working on Solana than on Cardano, Avalanche, and even Bitcoin. The host also mentioned Solana’s new compiler, Solang, which allows Ethereum developers to easily write dApps on Solana, predicting a huge wave of Ethereum dApps moving over to Solana in the near future.\n\nGroundbreaking Projects\n\nSolana is ready to support groundbreaking projects in its ecosystem. The host mentioned several promising projects in the DeFi space, such as Judo, Margin Phi, and Cipher. In the GameFi niche, Solana has created a $150 million fund to incubate projects, with games like Star Atlas and BR1 Infinite set to launch. Solana is also developing a new niche called d-PIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks), with notable projects like Helium building a decentralized wireless network.\n\nUnique Consumer Strategy\n\nUnlike most blockchains that cater mainly to developers, Coinsider says, Solana is focusing on real-world consumers. The host mentioned the Saga smartphone, a premium Android device developed by Solana Labs, which comes with a feature called Seed Vault that stores private keys and allows users to sign transactions with ease. Solana Labs has also launched a Chat GPT plugin that allows users to interact with the blockchain in various ways.\n\nPrice Prediction\n\nThe host compared Solana’s potential to Ethereum’s performance in the last cycle, predicting that Solana could easily do a 30x from its bear market low of around $10, reaching $300. Even at its current price of around $25, the host sees a potential 15x upside.\n\nAt the time of writing, SOL is trading at around $22.97, up 2.08% in the past 24-hour period.'}]

Ethereum (ETH-USD) has also done well, having risen 53% in the same period of time. But while the crypto winter of 2022 seems to be behind us, many digital coins and tokens continue to struggle or, worse, are subject to frequent pump-and-dump schemes that leave investors short-changed. Leading cryptos such as BTC and ETH are performing well, but many smaller digital assets continue to struggle, resulting in a divergence between the biggest cryptos and lesser-known ones, of which there are thousands. With the crypto market remaining heavily fragmented and volatile, we offer up three cryptos to sell in August before they crash and burn.\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWhy? That is the question investors need to ask themselves before putting money into Shiba Inu (SHIB-USD), a cryptocurrency that started as a joke and serves no actual purpose. Worse, Shiba Inu is based on another crypto that also started as a joke — Dogecoin (DOGE-USD). That makes Shiba Inu a joke of a joke. But make no mistake, the joke is on any investor who allocates capital to this digital token. After all, the only thing that seems to move the price of SHIB are tweets Elon Musk posts of his pet dog.\n\nBeyond having no practical purpose or utility, SHIB has also proven to be a bad investment, with the price down more than 40% in the last six months. Among cryptocurrencies, Shiba Inu remains extremely volatile. In the 24 hours before this article was written, SHIB’s price rose 5% and fell 8%. Also important to keep in mind is that Shiba Inu currently trades at just fractions of one cent. How do you value an investment with a decimal point and five zeros in front of it? This is a top cryptocurrency to avoid.\n\nRipple (XRP)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe price of the cryptocurrency Ripple (XRP-USD) has gone crazy lately, and investors should proceed with caution regarding this digital asset. XRP’s price surged in July following a court ruling that determined the cryptocurrency is not a security such as a stock and should not be regulated like one. Following the court ruling on July 13, Ripple’s price surged over 76%. Whether cryptocurrencies should be classified as securities or not is at the heart of efforts to regulate digital coins and tokens.\n\nRipple also generated headlines when an analyst at Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) issued a forecast saying that XRP could reach as high as $500 per token. Given that XRP is currently trading at 63 cents, the bullish forecast from Wells Fargo generated media headlines and debate on social media. While the catalysts and positive sentiment towards XRP might be encouraging, XRP has been here before. The crypto’s all-time high of $3.38 was reached in January 2018. It is now 81% below that high and has crashed many times over the years.\n\nSolana (SOL)\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nDown 44% in the last 12 months as the broader crypto market rallies, it might be time to throw the towel in on Solana (SOL-USD). That is a bit of a shame as Solana has a lot of promise, and many crypto enthusiasts remain bullish on its long-term prospects. A leading cryptocurrency when it comes to decentralized finance (DeFi) transactions, Solana has much in common with Ethereum. However, SOL is able to process DeFi transactions faster than Ethereum, leading many people to claim it is superior to ETH.\n\nCurrently, Solana can process 65,000 transactions per second compared to the 30 transactions per second that Ethereum can process. The lightning speed of Solana gives it an edge over ETH, as well as traditional banks and credit card companies, say advocates. The problem is that since Ethereum upgraded to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake operating protocol, investors seem to prefer ETH and have moved money into it rather than Solana, leading to the price decline. In time, SOL might recover. But for now, it is a crypto to sell in August.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

But now, according to Ansem, it seems that more casual interactions, like social apps involving NFTs and Web3 gaming, are the most effective avenues for adoption.\n\nAnsem notes that he might give friends ether (ETH) or bitcoin (BTC) to get them over the initial adoption hump, but to get them engaged in communities, NFTs provide a much stronger draw. “If I give one of my friends an NFT, it’s like, ‘Oh, I have an NFT — I’m a part of this community.

The Solana-based platform provides free NFTs from popular creators to subscribers, recently described to Blockworks.\n\n“Instead of doing mints, they do free drops for people every week. They give out all this art to people who subscribe to different artists on their platform. And then you can tip the artist if you really like their work and then share it with other people.”\n\nAnsem notes that the platform has sent out NFTs to “something crazy, like 700K, 800K wallets.” Approximately 250,000 of those new wallets, he says, have proceeded to use other Solana apps. “So they’ve done a pretty good job of onboarding completely new people.”\n\n“You don’t need any Solana in your wallet to get the NFT completely free,” he says. “Now you’re happy, and you’re like, ‘Oh, now what else can I do in the ecosystem?’”\n\n“They’re doing a really good job of onboarding people.”\n\nAnsem also says he is “big on gaming,” noting that nobody seems to have “hit it hard yet” in the industry. “It doesn’t really have to be all that complicated,” he says.\n\nHe harkens back to the simplistic but virally successful mobile game, Flappy Bird, that “did a really good job of getting people’s attention” years ago. Crypto has “a really great lane” to execute a similar strategy in mobile gaming, Ansem says, especially with low-cost ecosystems like Solana, focusing on mobile apps with innovations like xNFTS and the Backpack wallet.\n\nAnsem says that for any crypto project to reach a new audience, it must build a presence on Twitter, the platform where he established his brand. “If you don’t have a big presence on Twitter, you could be building the greatest technical-whatever-protocol to exist,” but if people don’t know about it, he says, “nobody’s going to use it.”\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

This period has not only showcased Solana’s prowess in propelling its DeFi ecosystem forward but has also seen an impressive surge in NFT sales volume. As Solana navigates challenges, its resilience shines through, reaffirming its position as a formidable player in the blockchain space.\n\nSolana’s DeFi Dynamo\n\nThe past month has illuminated Solana’s burgeoning DeFi landscape, primarily manifested through a significant uptick in Total Value Locked (TVL). DeFiLlama’s data paints a picture of consistent growth, with SOL’s TVL surging to a substantial $1.12 billion. Notably, the standout dApps that led this growth include Sharky, Parrot, and Saber Labs, as highlighted in a tweet by Solana Daily. These platforms have not only fueled TVL expansion but have also underscored Solana’s potential to become a DeFi powerhouse.\n\nWhile the DeFi ecosystem flourished, SOL token holders experienced some challenges, facing losses during this period. This dual dynamic of growth in TVL and investment challenges reveals the complexity of the market and the volatility that can come with it.\n\nNFT Renaissance on Solana\n\nBeyond the realm of DeFi, Solana’s NFT ecosystem has witnessed an impressive surge in activity. Sales volume for Solana-based NFTs surged by over 5% within a mere 30 days, signifying a growing interest in the platform’s NFT offerings. This surge in volume was accompanied by a 14% increase in buyers, an 18% rise in sellers, and a 5% uptick in transactions, all indicating a flourishing NFT ecosystem on Solana.\n\nResilience Amid Challenges\n\nOne of the standout features of Solana’s journey over the past month has been its resilience. Despite the collapse of FTX, a significant backer of Solana, the blockchain maintained its strength. Solana’s price weathered a substantial drop, from $250 to approximately $10, reflecting a daunting 96% decrease. This decline raised concerns about the platform’s stability, yet Solana displayed remarkable resilience. Throughout 2023, its daily active addresses remained consistent at around 300,000, aligning it with engagement levels observed on Ethereum and Polygon.\n\nMoreover, Solana’s transaction volumes rebounded, revisiting levels seen prior to the FTX collapse. Currently ranked as the fourth-highest generator of daily fees, Solana’s revival led to an impressive 150% price surge since the beginning of 2023. This resurgence not only reinstated Solana’s position among the top 10 cryptocurrencies but also emphasized its capacity to endure challenges.\n\nPower of the Developer Community\n\nSolana’s thriving developer community is an integral pillar of its success story. Ranked fourth globally for full-time developers across all blockchains, it has surpassed major contenders such as Cardano, Avalanche, and even Bitcoin in developer engagement. A standout addition to this landscape is Solang, a new compiler simplifying the process of creating dApps for Ethereum developers. This advancement could potentially pave the way for the migration of Ethereum-based dApps to the Solana platform.\n\nAs Solana continues to prove its mettle and adaptability, it cements its place as a transformative force within the blockchain realm. Its prowess in DeFi expansion, NFT resurgence, resilience in the face of adversity, and vibrant developer community collectively shape a narrative of growth and potential that is capturing the attention of the crypto community.'}, {'id': 12, 'time': 'Tue, 08 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Earth 8 | Chula Vista boosts its power grid | cbs8.com - CBS News 8', 'content': 'The Solana Beach-based tech company, EnerSmart, will help to store energy that can be sold and used on the grid when needed, making it more resilient to blackouts.\n\nCHULA VISTA, Calif. — San Diego continues to pave the way for more clean energy on our power grid with the arrival of EnerSmart’s new battery storage project that hopes to stabilize the power grid and increase renewable energy usage in Chula Vista.\n\nAs solar and wind power continue to grow as sources of energy for our power grid, so does the need to store that energy. It’s been a race to the finish to develop the most reliable and best-performing battery and now the latest company launching their product in the South Bay is EnerSmart – based out of Solana Beach.\n\n“We\'re really excited to be part of the solution," said James Beach, the Co-Founder of EnerSmart. "It’s a fantastic job, we love what we’re doing, and really excited to be in San Diego.”\n\nThe state of California is now on its way to meeting the most ambitious clean energy goals in the nation – setting a benchmark of 90 percent clean electricity by 2035, and 100 percent clean electricity by 2045.\n\n"Across the country, we’re really gonna be far down the line in transitioning away from an economy that’s so dependent on oil and gas to an economy that has so many other sources that we can rely on to provide cheaper energy, cleaner energy, more reliable energy over time," United States Representative Scott Peters (CA-50) told CBS 8. "One thing I\'m working on as well is really making sure that we turn these investments around more quickly. We have so much delay in our permitting process that I think the environmental community needs to realize that speed is what we’re after. We’re in a race against climate change."\n\nIn order to meet those goals, battery storage needs to hold clean energy when it’s produced, to be used on the grid during peak hours, or in the case of solar panels, when the sun isn’t shining.\n\n"One of the reasons we\'re here is that San Diego has the most expensive power in the country so it was one of the best places for battery storage projects," added Beach. "But over time, that will change. I think in 20 years power prices will be levelized. It’ll be clean, it will be reliable and very efficient, and it’s just gonna take some time to get there. But these are the first steps to help that happen."\n\nThese six energy storage containers in Chula Vista can store enough energy to power 3,000 homes in the area. Enersmart says more energy storage means less strain on our energy grid and less likelihood of electricity blackouts.\n\n"Basically the way it works is you have large power generation facilities transmit the power to the local area into a substation and then distribute it around," Beach told CBS 8. "Now, you’ve got a source of power right here so it can come in and put energy on the system quickly and absolutely help with brownouts."\n\nThe company now has 11 additional projects in development in the county with other competitors also stepping up and developing more clean energy as well as ways to store it in off-hours.\n\n"The development of battery storage projects like these are critical to ensure that we not only meet our renewable energy demands but also support our grid that is reliable and secure," said Jason Anderson, the President of Clean Tech San Diego. "Innovators like EnerSmart are filling a critical gap by allowing the increased use of renewable energy at all times of day and in any condition."\n\nThe project was financed by North American Development Bank, a company that supports environmental infrastructure projects mainly along the U.S. - Mexico Border.'}]

So if it breaks down below that trendline [around $16.50], which is an ‘if/then’ statement, I don’t know for sure if it would, but if it did break down below that trendline, then it makes me wonder — does it actually go on to sweep the low [around $11]?\n\nNow I know that might be seen as a fairly bearish view, but I can’t help but remember the last cycle when ADA… did the exact same thing. It basically capitulated over here, put in a high, we then swept the high, and then we went down, and guess what? We swept the lows.\n\nIt was only after Cardano swept the lows that it then took off into a more sustained run. So I’m still thinking that there is a chance that a lot of these altcoins could fade back down and sweep some of their lows, maybe take those lows out.

Based on the news articles, it is evident that there is mixed sentiment surrounding Solana (SOL) in the cryptocurrency market. While Benjamin Cowen predicts a potential bearish trend for SOL, citing similarities to Cardano's past price trajectory, the decision by Bitstamp to suspend trading of SOL for US users due to regulatory uncertainty adds to the uncertainty. However, despite these factors, SOL has shown resilience and is currently trading at $24.20, up nearly 5% in the past 24 hours. Overall, the market trend for SOL may experience some volatility in the short term, but its current price movement suggests a potential for a turnaround in the near future.

*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the given reports, it is clear that the on-chain data analysis indicates a bullish market trend for ETH, with consistent increases in open prices, total transactions, and successful transactions. The MACD signal remaining at a "buy" level further supports this positive trend. However, the news analyst report highlights external factors such as the Coast Guard incident near Solana Beach and Solana Mobile's price reduction strategy, which could potentially impact investor sentiment and market dynamics.

In reflection, it is evident that prioritizing on-chain data and long-term bullish market trends has been effective in maximizing profit potential. While short-term volatility and external factors may introduce uncertainty, a moderately conservative trading approach that balances long-term strategies with consideration of external factors is recommended.

Considering the overall market trend and the need for a strategic approach, I would recommend a trading action of 0.7, indicating a high level of confidence in the bullish market trend for ETH and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately for long-term gains.

Centered around the captivating motif of toads, the project’s NFTs are more than just aesthetic artworks: they offer a glimpse into the realm of potential profits and utility.\n\nThese NFTs, known as Toads Friends NFTs are available for minting on the DigiToads website. One can also get the NFTs by purchasing them from the NFTs marketplace, Open Sea. Where they are making waves for their increasing value and potential for future profits.\n\nOne crucial factor contributing to DigiToads’ distinction is its deflationary nature, with strong value growth witnessed even in the presale phase. This growth further solidifies the projected future value of DigiToads NFTs. Adding to the excitement and interest among potential investors and collectors.\n\nBeyond the monetary allure, DigiToads NFTs offer practical use cases within the DigiToads swamp ecosystem, the concept of staking DigiToads NFTs to earn passive income via $TOADS transactions adds an enticing layer of value to these digital assets.\n\nAdditionally, the project’s platinum Toads incentive which is awarded to the top traders in every monthly, TOAD vs TOAD trading competition grants access to the TOADS treasury, fostering community involvement and development.\n\nDigiToads also offers a liquidity staking pol where NFTs holders can earn passive income by locking up their NFTs. This liquidity pool is funded by 2% of the 7% tax charged on all TOADs transactions. This means that every time a transaction involving TOADS token takes place, 2% of the tax charged on this transaction is sent to the staking pool. The funds in the staking pool are then used to pay those who lock up their NFTs, creating a never-ending cycle that rewards the most dedicated TOADS enthusiasts.\n\nInvestors who won more than four DigiToads NFTs will have free access to the Toad school, a platform that offers comprehensive trading courses to interested participants. As DigiToads continues to execute its roadmap, Toad School grandaunts will have new opportunities to make use of their education within the Swamp ecosystem. For example, when the trading Post, DigiToad’s decentralized exchange launches, Toad school grandaunt will have an opportunity to put their trading lessons to use while also contributing to the growth of their favorite project.\n\nSolana’s On-Chain Activity Decline\n\nWhile DigiToads thrives, Solana’s blockchain is facing a different narrative. Once celebrated for its lightning-fast transaction speeds and robust ecosystem, Solana is now grappling with a drop in on-chain activity. The reasons for the decline are multifaceted and could range from network congestion issues to changes in user behavior.\n\nThe reduction in on-chain activity raises questions about Solana’s future trajectory. However, as it’s normal for blockchain ecosystems to experience fluctuations, this decline might be a temporary phase rather than a definitive trend.\n\nFinal Word\n\nIn the world of cryptocurrencies, contrasts are inevitable. Solana’s on-chain activity slump reflects the challenges even established networks can face, while DigiToad’s rise showcases the power of creativity and utility in captivating the crypto community’s attention.

Therefore, a moderately conservative trading approach is recommended to safeguard against market fluctuations while capitalizing on long-term gains.

Considering the overall market trend and the importance of long-term strategies, I would recommend a trading action of 0.7, indicating a high level of confidence in the bullish trend for ETH and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately. This action reflects a belief in the potential for further price increases in the near future while also being mindful of short-term volatility.

"""
Based on the recent data, the ETH cryptocurrency has been experiencing a consistent uptrend with open prices gradually increasing from 23.19 to 24.91. The total transactions have been fluctuating but remain relatively high, indicating continued interest and activity in the market. The successful transactions have also been on the rise, suggesting a positive sentiment among traders. The MACD signal has consistently been indicating a buy, further supporting the bullish trend. However, the last open price of 24.91 with a MACD signal of sell may indicate a potential short-term correction or consolidation. Overall, the market trend for ETH appears to be bullish, but traders should be cautious of a possible reversal in the near future.

NEWS ANALYST REPORT:
"""
The news articles highlight contrasting trends in the cryptocurrency market, with Solana showing potential for a bullish upswing due to the formation of a double bottom pattern, indicating a possible price rise towards $30. On the other hand, Solana's on-chain activity has declined, raising questions about its future trajectory. In contrast, DigiToads NFTs are gaining popularity and value, showcasing the power of creativity and utility in the crypto space. Overall, while Solana's short-term outlook appears positive, the market remains dynamic with opportunities and challenges shaping the cryptocurrency industry's evolution.

Anatoly Yakovenko, the cofounder of Solana, imagined developing a handheld computer with the expectation for crypto to go mobile. Saga, a Web3 phone was launched in April 2023 and is finally available for the local public. Let’s take a look at the features and functionality of a newly launched smartphone.\n\nWhat is Solana SAGA?\n\nSolana Saga is an android smartphone introduced by Solana Blockchain company in 2023 with the purpose to make crypto-related functions easier and more efficient. The overall functioning of the smartphone is usual as other Android phones and involves a decentralized application (DApp) store offering a seamless experience with the DApps and Crypto wallets.\n\nFocusing on the technical specifications, the phone comes up with 512 gigabytes of memory, a Snapdragon 8+ Gen1 processor, and 12 gigabytes of RAM. The smartphone ensures a high level of security, offering a secure way to save master passwords or storing of seed phrases.\n\nHow Can the Web3 Smartphone be Used to Buy and Sell Cryptos?\n\nSolana SAGA can be a bit confusing for newcomers, but probably worthwhile for individuals investing tens of thousands of dollars in Crypto. The main feature that makes the smartphone unique compared to usual smartphones is its dApp store holding around 21 dApps for download. The setup of the phone is easy and involves the creation of a Solana wallet and a seed vault where the phase is stored and can be unlocked using sign transactions and wallets. The dApp store plays a vital role in accessing applications and networks including games, social categories, and DeFi. Access to several dApps and offers rewards or tokens when starting with Saga. The phone made it for the users to Swap USD coins into Solana using the fingerprint sensor using the Phantom Wallet.\n\nAnother main feature of Solana SAGA is the easy minting of NFTs which makes NFT purchasing cost-efficient. The minting will be approved instantly which is another major benefit of the web3 phone to the crypto users. Apart from this, other applications will work normally as the phone relies on the Android ecosystem and supports the applications. Solana Saga phone is available in the Android version and is expected to launch its iPhone in the upcoming years. The current retail price of the Web3 smartphone is around $1000 apiece and has the potential to beat Android and iPhone in the near future.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo make the buying and selling of digital assets more easy and efficient, Solana blockchain company came up with a new idea. The company launched Solana SAGA, a web3 smartphone embedded with the dApp store. The phone offers usually functioning of the Android applications and included dApp stores offering several applications, DeFi, and websites supporting cryptocurrency. The phone is emerging as one of the safest and most efficient platforms for individuals trading digital assets for tens of thousands of dollars.'}, {'id': 5, 'time': 'Sun, 13 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Shiba Inu surges; DeGods Season 3 unveiled; risk sentiment improves for US stocks - Yahoo Finance', 'content': 'Bitcoin dipped slightly Monday morning in Asia, having hovered around the $29,380 level throughout the weekend. Ether and most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization were little changed. The exceptions were Dogecoin, which saw a significant dip, and Shiba Inu. The dog-themed memecoin surged ahead of its upcoming layer-2 network launch. Elsewhere, the Forkast 500 NFT index dropped after a week of green ink, while risk sentiment in U.S. equities improved as traders assess the latest inflation data. Investors now await a raft of earnings reports throughout the week.\n\nShiba Inu cracks top 10 non-stablecoin crypto list\n\nBitcoin dipped 0.10% in the last 24 hours to US$29,375.75 as of 5:45 a.m. in Hong Kong but added 0.96% for the week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world’s largest cryptocurrency hovered around the same price level throughout the weekend.\n\nEther was up 0.11% to US$1,849.50 for a weekly gain of 1.00%.\n\nAnalysts continue to predict a market upswing ahead of various U.S. application rulings for spot Bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs).\n\nIn June 2023, BlackRock and a number of major U.S. financial institutions filed applications with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to create spot Bitcoin ETFs. The SEC has previously rejected several spot Bitcoin ETF applications, citing concerns about market manipulation and volatility. However, the recent burst of applications has raised hopes that investors may soon see a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThe SEC was expected to announce its decision on Ark Investment’s Spot Bitcoin ETF application on Aug. 13. However, the regulator said in a Friday filing that it will solicit public comment on the ETF proposal, effectively pushing back the deadline.\n\n“Although the chances of imminent ETF-related news are slim, any announcement would likely have a more pronounced effect on BTC than on ETH,” said Luuk Strijers, chief commercial officer of Panama-based crypto derivatives exchange Deribit.\n\n“We are observing a slight uptick in BTC, especially visible versus ETH. A potential catalyst for this could be the looming ETF news on the shorter term and the halvening impact on the longer run,” Strijers added.\n\nBitcoin’s next halving event is expected to take place in April 2024. The halving event will see the amount of new Bitcoin issued cut in half, increasing its scarcity. This is widely anticipated to produce a surge in the token’s price.\n\nOther top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies were largely static Monday morning, with the exception of memecoins Dogecoin and Shiba Inu.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Dogecoin dropped 2.11% to US$0.07524, slipping 0.25% in the last seven days, the Shiba Inu memecoin briefly cracked CoinMarketCap’s top 10 cryptocurrency list over the weekend. It pushed Polkadot’s DOT down to eleventh in terms of market capitalization. The meme token then fell 3.01% to US$0.00001042 over the past 24 hours, but still recorded an 11% gain for the week.\n\nThe developers behind Shiba Inu are expected to launch its layer-2 network, Shibarium, at an unspecified date in the near future. The update aims to provide self-sovereign identity (SSI) protocols for improved user security, according to a Shiba Inu blog post uploaded on Aug. 6.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization grew 0.09% in the past 24 hours to US$1.17 trillion, while trading volume also increased 7.08% to US$17.82 billion.\n\nDeGods unveil Season 3 artwork\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index fell 0.52% in the past 24 hours to 2,480.44 as of 06:45 a.m. in Hong Kong. However, it recorded a 0.95% gain for the week. Meanwhile, Forkast’s Ethereum NFT Index logged gains, while the indexes measuring the Polygon, Cardano and Solana NFTs showed losses.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume dropped 5.35% in the past 24 hours to over US$13.92 million, according to data from CryptoSlam.\n\nSales volume on Ethereum, the largest NFT network, dipped 1.75% to US$8.63 million. Solana and Polygon, which placed second and third on Cryptoslam’s NFT blockchain ranking respectively, also logged losses.\n\nIn terms of NFT collections, trade volume of Ethereum-based DeGods surged 133.20% to US$1 million. That followed the launch of its “Season 3” digital art collection Sunday. The update features a more simplistic, pop-art inspired style.\n\n1.

Principal Matt Frumovitz admittedly fretted that everything would get done in time and it was a relief that teachers were able to move into their new classrooms on schedule, with just finishing touches and last checklist items remaining before the first day of school on Aug. 14.\n\n“The teachers, students and the entire community showed an unbelievable amount of patience and we’re really grateful for what we got out of it,” Frumovitz said.\n\nA classroom inside the new building at Solana Santa Fe. (Karen Billing)\n\nNew this school year is Solana Santa Fe’s two-story classroom building, home to eight classrooms for first through fourth grades as well as a learning center. The building blends perfectly into the existing campus, with some modern touches but architecture that matches the look of the Fairbanks Ranch community.\n\nThe school also debuted an improved parking lot, with extended queues to keep the drop-off and pick-off lines flowing and avoid traffic backups on El Apajo and San Dieguito Road. A new pick-up area was also created for students, with multiple benches to wait for rides.\n\nDuring the summer, the school’s front office was also tweaked to improve efficiency.\n\nThis summer’s work caps off last summer’s construction which included the revamped front entrance and administrative offices, new lunch shelters and school kitchen, an expanded kindergarten play area and new staff parking lot. The school’s fire alarm and heating and air conditioning systems were also upgraded.\n\nIn addition to the new building, all of the campus classrooms received new carpet and new furniture over the summer: “The teachers are thrilled,” Frumovitz said.\n\nThe $26 million project was funded by a combination of Measure JJ and community facilities district monies from the Crosby and Pacific Highlands Ranch.\n\nSince the Solana Beach School District’s general obligation bond passed in 2016, Measure JJ projects have included the Solana Highlands and Solana Santa Fe modernizations and the new Skyline and the new Solana Vista campuses. Next up will be modernization projects at Carmel Creek and Solana Pacific Schools.\n\n'}, {'id': 4, 'time': 'Mon, 14 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Solana vs Polygon: How is 2023 turning out to be for both? - AMBCrypto News', 'content': 'Solana’s TVL gained and hit its highest level since the beginning of 2023\n\nMATIC’s market cap plummeted in June, while SOL registered gains\n\nOver the last few months, Polygon [MATIC] has witnessed a surge in its network activity, with the same higher than that of Solana [SOL]. However, Solana still dominated Polygon by a significant margin in terms of transactions. Not only that, but SOL’s performance in the DeFi space also remains promising, as its TVL hit this year’s highest level recently. In fact, SOL also outshined MATIC by its price action, as the former overtook the latter in market capitalization.\n\nRead Polygon’s [MATIC] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nIs Polygon actually ahead of Solana?\n\nArtemis’ data pointed out that Solana’s daily active addresses declined over the last three months. This allowed Polygon to overtake Solana in terms of that metric. Moreover, MATIC has consistently managed to have more users on the network to date. However, looking at the whole picture revealed that MATIC is still way behind SOL in the number of daily transactions processed by the networks.\n\nNot only that, Solana is also closing in on Polygon in terms of their captured value. As is evident from Artemis’ chart, Solana’s fees and revenue have gained since mid-July, even flipping Polygon on two occasions.\n\nHowever, at press time, Polygon’s fees and revenue remained slightly higher than those of SOL. Nonetheless, SOL recently touched a new milestone. DeFiLlama pointed out that SOL’s TVL was moving up and, at press time, was sitting at the highest level since the beginning of the year.\n\nA wider look at both blockchains\n\nApart from network activity, both blockchains’ staking ecosystems are also interesting to observe. SOL is way ahead of MATIC in terms of staking market cap, as the former’s figures stood at $9.77 billion, while the latter had a staking market cap of $2.4 billion at press time. While MATIC had a staking ratio of 38.91%, SOL posted a reading of 70.84%. Moreover, the number of staking wallets was also higher on Solana than on Polygon.\n\nNonetheless, Santiment’s chart revealed both blockchains have been performing neck to neck in their respective NFT ecosystems. Both MATIC and SOL had similar numbers of NFT trade counts and trade volume in USD, which proves the competition.\n\nBullish price action for Solana?\n\nTowards the beginning of May, MATIC’s market cap was well above that of SOL. However, things started to turn sour for MATIC as it bled considerably over the next few weeks. This allowed Solana to take over, as the token flipped MATIC on 6 July. Since then, the latter has been able to reclaim its lead in terms of market cap.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Solana Profit Calculator\n\nIn fact, as per CoinMarketCap, SOL’s price appreciated by over 7% over the past week. On the contrary, MATIC only managed to hike by 1%. At press time, SOL was trading at $24.77 while MATIC’s value was $0.6794 on the charts.'}, {'id': 12, 'time': 'Mon, 14 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Solana Vs. Chainlink - What's the Difference? - Securities.io", 'content': "When learning the key differences between Solana and Chainlink, it's vital to understand that the two networks serve very different roles in the market. These projects may share certain traits, such as popularity, but from there, the many differences become obvious. Here's some valuable insight into Solana vs. Chainlink.\n\nWhat is Solana?\n\nSolana is a third-generation open-source public blockchain. This layer 1 protocol supports high-speed transactions and smart contract programmability. The network features an open and adaptable infrastructure that supports the creation of blockchain assets and networks.\n\nNotably, the project was founded by Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal in 2018. Solana went live in 2020, with the first block logged on March 16 of the same year. Interestingly, the name Solana refers to a quiet beach town that the developers lived in for many years before launching the project. Today, Solana is one of the most popular blockchains in the market.\n\nWhat is Chainlink?\n\nChainlink operates as a decentralized Oracle network and infrastructure provider. The platform is open source and public – similar to Solana. However, Chainlink was built to serve a much different role than Solana in that its main goal is to support the integration and creation of a decentralized oracle network.\n\nOracles are sensors that enable blockchains to connect to nearly any actions on or off-chain. There are oracles that do things like monitor payments to release documents at the time of completion, monitor weather, track stocks, and everything else you can imagine. As such, oracles are a crucial part of today's crypto market.\n\nChainlink entered the market as a smart contract consulting firm in 2014 before changing focus towards oracles in 2017. Sergey Nazarov and Steve Ellis are the founders of this unique network. Today, Chainlink is a vital component of many other platforms' operations. Its reliable and secure oracles have earned a reputation as one of the best options for those seeking oracles.\n\nWhat Problems Was Solana Built to Alleviate?\n\nSolana was designed to eliminate or reduce very specific issues that existed at the time of its entrance into the market. Solana was created when Ethereum, the world's top DeFi and token launch network, was amid massive slowdowns and high fees due to congestion.\n\nSolana's developers wanted to provide a more programmable and easier-to-use blockchain experience. They desired to make the network more flexible and easier to work with for Dapp developers. This strategy has proved successful as the platform continues to garner new Dapps.\n\nAnother major pain point that Solana targets are network fees. It was amid record-high fees when Solana launched. The network charges a fraction of the cost of using Ethereum. Additionally, it's much faster than the original Ethereum network. Solana can handle 29,171 tps.\n\nWhat Problems Was Chainlink Built to Alleviate?\n\nChainlink was developed to tackle a very specific issue that had plagued the crypto market for years. The platform's developers wanted to make it easy and cost-effective to integrate distributed oracles into Dapps. This concept was revolutionary at the time, as most networks relied on centralized oracles.\n\nCorrupt Oracles\n\nThe problem with that approach was that data could be corrupted and entered into the blockchain incorrectly. Since most public blockchains are immutable and uneditable, this bad information could cause a slew of issues down the line. To combat these concerns, Chainlink introduced a self-monitoring and healing oracle network.\n\nThere are a lot of efficiencies gained from using Chainlink as opposed to creating custom oracles. For one, the research and testing of new oracles can be a time-consuming and expensive task. Additionally, to provide the same level of service, you would need to create a decentralized self-checking and healing network which is far outside the budget of most projects.\n\nRoadblocks to Integration and Adoption\n\nChainlink makes it easy for developers to integrate a decentralized oracle system into their dapps without the need to master new coding. The process continues to be streamlined to help improve results. Today, there are a variety of networks leveraging Chainlink oracles to send and receive data.\n\nHow Does Solana Work?\n\nSolana leverages two consensus mechanisms to improve performance. The primary Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus system enables users to stake their tokens to secure passive returns. The network has a 2.34-second block time currently.\n\nSolana is one of only a few blockchain networks that leverage dual consensus systems to improve performance. The Proof of History (POH) protocol leverages time stamps to create a cryptographic clock that speeds up the reference process.\n\nSOL\n\nSol is the utility token for Solana. It can be staked and used to pay for transaction fees. Developers also use SOL to cover gas fees. SOL is a popular token that can be found on most top-performing CEXs (centraliz..."}, {'id': 3, 'time': 'Mon, 14 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Solana Vs. Polkadot (2024 Edition) - Securities.io', 'content': "Learning the differences between Solana (SOL) vs Polkadot (DOT) is a great way to improve your market knowledge. Both of these projects provide significant advantages over earlier generation blockchains. However, they do serve different roles with some overlap. Here is everything you need to know about Solana (SOL) vs Polkadot (DOT).\n\nWhat is Solana?\n\nSolana was built to provide top-notch scalability and developer flexibility. The protocol integrates an open infrastructure and low gas fees to empower developers to build more immersive and useful Dapps. The network is much faster and cheaper than Ethereum with the average cost per transaction sitting at around $0.00025.\n\nSolana is the brainchild of Anatoly Yakovenko. The network entered the market in 2017 during the crypto breakout year. The network received immediate attention due to its high transaction throughput and experienced developers including Greg Fitzgerald, and Eric Williams. These two held prior positions at Dropbox and Qualcomm.\n\nIn January, Solana suffered a string of outages with some lasting over 8-hours. These outages were the result of bots rushing to swoop up arbitrage opportunities to earn returns on leveraged positions. These outages dropped the price of the network's token briefly and caused some traders to question the project's sustainability. Despite the losses, Solana is still a popular option for developers and traders alike.\n\nWhat is Polkadot?\n\nPolkadot is another smart contract programmable blockchain ecosystem. The protocol differs from Solana in that it integrates a multi-chain application environment. To provide interoperability with other blockchain networks. The goal of Polkadot is to drive blockchain adoption and interoperability by enabling developers to send data fluently between networks in a secure manner.\n\nPolkadot (DOT) first emerged as a concept in 2016. That's when Ethereum co-developer Gavin Wood released the network's whitepaper. Wood is one of the most influential people in the crypto sector and is credited for his development of the Solidity smart contract programming language used by Ethereum.\n\nPolkadot raised eyebrows across the market when it secured $145 million in funding during its record-breaking ICO. However, the success was short-lived as the Parity wallet in which the ICO funds were stored was hacked and $150 million in crypto stolen. While these setbacks did slow the project at the start, today, Polkadot is a top-performing network.\n\nWhat Problems does Solana Solve?\n\nSolana was designed to provide developers with more scalability and flexibility than Ethereum. The network eliminates scaling concerns due to its technical structure. The protocol can scale proportionally to match network bandwidth. Bench test put Solana at 29,171 tps (transactions per second).\n\nFragmentation\n\nAnother major concern for Solana developers was network fragmentation. Most inter-chain protocols rely on second layer protocols which create more centralization in the network. Solana maintains a single global state which provides a more secure and efficient alternative.\n\nData Delays\n\nEarlier blockchains looked towards sharding as a way to provide more storage space. However, the technical layout of sharded networks creates delays in data retrieval. Solana integrates proprietary systems to provide a more streamlined alternative that can meet the needs of a global market.\n\nWhat Problems does Polkadot Solve?\n\nPolkadot was built to enable private and public blockchains to communicate freely. The developers behind the project see this integration as a key step in driving blockchain adoption. Additionally, creators gain a lot of benefits using Polkadot including the ability to integrate the best characteristics from varying blockchain networks into their Dapps.\n\nPolkadot streamlines programming tasks associated with Dapp development. It provides scalability on par with top-performing blockchains. Additionally, the multi-chain structure of the network simplifies the creation of sub-networks, tokens, and more.\n\nHow Does Solana Work?\n\nSolana combines a variety of protocols to accomplish its goal to become the fastest blockchain in the market. The network leverages a protocol called turbine to separate and transmit data across the network's nodes. This data is then sent to a feature called Gulf Stream.\n\nGolf Stream replaces the need for a mempool like Bitcoin uses which speeds up the transactions process. The Gulf Stream protocol can handle 50,000 tps. One of the most unique aspects of this approach is that the system forwards the packets to nodes before the last batch completes confirmation.\n\nCloudbreak\n\nThe Cloudbreak protocol operates as the networks accounts database. The system improves on earlier blockchain in multiple ways. For example, Cloudbreak can read and write data simultaneously which improves transactions speeds and enables Dapps to operate more responsively.\n\nSolana Coin\n\nSOL is the native utility token for the Solana netwo..."}, {'id': 6, 'time': 'Mon, 14 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Foo Fighters’ guitarist Chris Shiflett shakes things up with ‘Lost at Sea’ solo album and mini tour - LA Daily News', 'content': 'Though Chris Shiflett gets to rock out on guitar in front of thousands of fans at mega music festivals and sold-out stadiums around the world with the Foo Fighters, he’s equally as excited to bust out a well-worn acoustic guitar and play alt-country and Americana songs inside more intimate clubs.\n\nHe’s fortunate, he said, to have a foot in both worlds and though he’s earned a certain level of notoriety, at his core he’s just a huge music fan.\n\nAside from being in arguably one of the biggest rock bands on the planet, Shiflett, who came up in the punk rock world in bands like No Use for a Name and Me First and the Gimme Gimmes, has enjoyed a fulfilling solo career. He’s got three albums under his belt, including the forthcoming “Lost at Sea,” which will be out on Oct. 20 via Blue Élan Records. While on a brief break in the Foo Fighters’ busy touring schedule, Shiflett will bring his new music to the Belly Up in Solana Beach on Thursday, Aug. 24 and The Venice West in Venice on Friday, Aug. 25.\n\nChris Shiflett will play the Belly Up in Solana Beach on Aug. 24 and The Venice West in Venice on Aug. 25 in support of his third solo record, the forthcoming “Lost at Sea,” which is due out on Oct. 20 on Blue Élan Records.

(Photo by Joey Martinez)\n\n“We’ve been playing about four songs off the record live so far, but we should probably get down a couple more,” Shiflett said during a phone interview from his Los Angeles home. “It has been really fun. It’s interesting to play a song nobody’s heard before. If you can get a crowd to react to a song no one has ever heard, it’s like, all right, this could be good.”\n\nSo far, he’s peppered in the rippin’ guitar-forward rock track “Black Top White Lines,” which Shiflett wrote with album producer and The Cadillac Three vocalist-guitarist Jaren Johnston and Brothers Osborne songwriter-guitarist John Osborne; the country twang-filled “Dead and Gone” featuring the talents of Charlie Worsham (Dierks Bentley, Old Crow Medicine Show) on dobro and Tom Bukovac (Bob Seger, Willie Nelson) on guitar; as well as and the Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers-influenced, “Overboard.”\n\nWhile his first two albums, 2017’s “West Coast Town” and 2019’s “Hard Lessons,” lean more heavily on an alt-country sound, “Lost at Sea” is more all over the map sonically, with tunes that could please audiences in both punk rock bars or a boot-scootin’ honky tonks. At the time of our interview, “Damage Control,” which conjures a reggae-island music à la Jimmy Buffett vibe, was Shiflett’s favorite new song.\n\n“I pretty much wrote all the songs during lockdown in 2020-2021, except for ‘Damage Control,’” he said. He actually wrote that song 15 years ago and while on tour with a night off in New York City several years back, he and a friend recorded a version of it in a basement studio. He unearthed the old song while digging through files to create this album and sent the raw recording to Johnston, who insisted it should live on “Lost at Sea.”\n\n“It’s pretty different from the demo, which I will never play anyone because it’s really, really (bad),” he says with a laugh. “But now it’s one of my favorite songs on the whole record. I love what Charlie Worsham played on that, he’s singing and playing acoustic guitar and there’s a banjo track on there that kinda became the hook of the song and I love it.”\n\nOn top of his numerous musical projects, Shiflett also has a popular podcast, “Walking the Floor,” on which he interviews famous musicians,...'}]

(SBSD)\n\n“She has been an incredible and exceptional leader through a very significant paradigm shift in education in this country and has brought the district out of an unusual time, back to normal. Not a lot of districts were able to make that shift so seamlessly like the Solana Beach School District has under her leadership,” SBSD President Debra Schade said. “We are really excited that she is part of our governance team...we really are focused on making really wonderful things happen for the brighter futures of our students.”\n\nAt the meeting, Brentlinger thanked the board for their support as she embarks on another school year with an “amazing” group of professionals, staff, teachers and board governance team, “aspiring to greatness.” As she has every year, on the first day of school Aug. 14 Brentlinger visited all seven district schools, switching into each school’s spirit gear, logging over 10,000 steps and greeting students in over 125 classrooms.\n\nIn her comments, board member Julie Union said it is inspiring to watch Brentlinger’s personal interactions when she is at the schools as it is obvious that she truly loves children. In the past five years, Union said Brentlinger has brought about a positive culture and “unity of purpose” throughout the board and the entire district.\n\n'}, {'id': 3, 'time': 'Tue, 15 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "A tokenized version of Bitcoin is launching on Solana. Here's what you need to know - Yahoo Finance", 'content': 'Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency on the planet, and as such it has become central to the industry, which spans many blockchains.\n\nBut Bitcoin as a transactable asset has its limits. Although it hosts the most valuable coin, the Bitcoin blockchain is slow to adopt new features, and executing smaller transactions is slow and often costly.\n\nTo solve these drawbacks and allow investors on different blockchains to use and leverage Bitcoin, the Threshold Network, backed by Threshold DAO, created the first “tokenized” version of Bitcoin, tBTC, which launched Tuesday on the Solana blockchain.\n\nBut what is a tokenized version of a cryptocurrency, and what are the advantages of tBTC that give it the potential to level up DeFi on Solana? Matt Luongo and Maclane Wilkison, two key architects of the tBTC protocol, are here to explain.\n\nWhat is tokenized crypto?\n\nYou can put native Bitcoin in a hardware wallet or in a software wallet, or send it to someone, Luongo told Fortune, but it\'s limited in how it can be used by smart contracts, even with the Lightning Network, a layer-2 protocol built on top of the Bitcoin network to expedite smaller transactions.\n\nWhen someone mints tBTC on Solana, they send Bitcoin to be “wrapped,” which involves a process of decentralized review. The crypto is held in custody in a wallet that is validated by 51 of 100 people operating “nodes” on the Threshold Network that review and agree the crypto you\'ve sent is correct and authentic.\n\nYou can then mint the same number of Bitcoin that you wrapped, but in tBTC, which can be used on the Solana blockchain. The tBTC, therefore, serves as a receipt that allows you to prove you have a certain number of Bitcoin. If you want your Bitcoin back, simply trade for it with tBTC. After 51 of 100 validators sign off, you can claim your original Bitcoin.\n\n“It\'s not a single party going bankrupt and you can\'t get your money, or a single party walking off—51 people have to have tried to actively be malicious to prevent you from getting your money back when you want it,” Luongo explained.\n\nWhy is this useful?\n\nThe original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, remains the hardest to use, added Luongo, also CEO of Thesis, the venture studio behind the Threshold Network.\n\n“Bitcoin by itself is not that useful—Lightning has been limited,” Luongo said. “Tools like Solana, and like some of these other layer-2s in the ecosystem, are alternatives to Lightning. They’re alternatives to scaling Bitcoin.”\n\nIf you want to take out a loan against your Bitcoin, you often have to turn to centralized lenders, like BlockFi, which Ethereum network. Luongo pointed out that he believes wBTC is less safe than tBTC because it involves crypto being held by a single custodian instead of in a wallet controlled by a series of validators like with tBTC.\n\nStory continues\n\nApart from Solana, Threshold has launched tBTC on other blockchains—Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon. The current supply of tBTC is about $29 million across all blockchains, according to Dune, compared with $4.2 billion of wBTC.\n\nSolana has been rebuilding its credibility after taking a hit last year because of associations with Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX and Alameda Research, which declared bankruptcy in November. But Luongo said he believes on-chain DeFi is making a comeback.\n\n“I think tBTC is going to be the beginning of a renaissance for DeFi on Solana,” he added.\n\nAlameda had been a big source of Bitcoin liquidity for the Solana blockchain, but tBTC may be able to help fill that gap, according to Wilkison, who added: "One important piece is bringing back Bitcoin to Solana, but another is bringing it back in a way that’s not exposed to those types of centralized risks."\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nMore from Fortune:\n\n5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from home\n\nLooking to make extra cash?

Ether dipped, while most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded flat to lower, with Solana’s SOL the only one strengthening. The Forkast 500 NFT index moved up after the NFT market saw the largest weekly total transactions since February 2022. Most Asian stock markets dropped after China unexpectedly lowered its interest rate on Tuesday morning and released weaker-than-expected economic data. U.S. stock futures also declined and European bourses traded lower.\n\nBitcoin, Ether flat; Solana rises\n\nBitcoin remained unchanged in the last 24 hours to trade at US$29,380.78 as of 5 p.m. in Hong Kong, and logged a weekly gain of 0.82%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world’s leading cryptocurrency briefly reached a high of US$29,660.25 early Tuesday morning.\n\nBitcoin prices are below its 50-day moving average of US$29,887, with its 30-day realized volatility falling to 17%, the lowest since November 2018, which both indicate bearishness in the token, Markus Thielen, head of research & strategy at digital asset service platform Matrixport, said in an emailed note on Tuesday.\n\nMeanwhile, the “Greed & Fear Index prints 54% for Bitcoin, above the 21-day moving average which signals that a rally could occur imminently,” added Thielen.\n\nBitcoin’s price has remained largely within at US$29,000-30,600 for the past seven weeks, causing frustration among investors seeking higher rewards. However, low volatility could prove to be a blessing in disguise, said Nigel Green, founder and chief executive officer of financial management group deVere, in an emailed statement.\n\n“This newfound stability attracts institutional investors, who have been historically wary of entering the market due to its extreme price swings,” Green said.\n\n“This stability is also a boon for businesses and consumers looking for a reliable store of value or medium of exchange,” he added.\n\nDigital asset investment products saw an inflow of US$29 million in the week ending Aug. 11. That followed three consecutive weeks of outflows totalling around US$144 million, according to a Monday report by European alternative asset manager CoinShares. Bitcoin saw an inflow of US$27 million — roughly 93% of the total inflows.\n\nThe inflows to digital asset investment products are “likely due to the recent U.S. inflation data, which was slightly below expectations, signifying that a September rate hike is less likely,” CoinShares wrote in the report.\n\nEther dipped 0.33% to US$1,840.95 but added 0.71% for the past seven days. Other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies all traded lower with the exception of Solana’s SOL, which moved up 1.39% to US$24.82 and gained 7.09% for the week.\n\nSynthesis One, an artificial intelligence (AI) data crowdsourcing platform based on the Solana blockchain, launched its new train-to-earn application “Workspace by Synesis” on Monday.\n\nThe app allows users to train AIs as data providers while earning cryptocurrencies as rewards. This process, Synthesis One claims, will result in a “fully traceable and auditable” data supply chain.\n\nShiba Inu, which has recently replaced Polkadot as the 10th biggest non-stablecoin cryptocurrency by market cap, led the losers, falling 2.89% to US$0.00001028 while logging a weekly jump of 14.51%\n\nThe token received a boost from the incoming launch of Shibarium, a layer-2 network built by Shiba Inu developers whose launch date is yet to be unveiled.\n\nBlockchain analytics platform Lookonchain noted Tuesday that bankrupt crypto lender Voyager Digital had been selling its assets including Shiba Inu, which could weaken the upward trend in the token.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dipped 0.18% in the past 24 hours to US$1.17 trillion, while trading volume edged up 7.75% to US$26.17 billion.\n\nWeekly NFT transactions rise to year-high\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index moved up 0.27% in the past 24 hours to 2,482.04 as of 17:50 p.m. in Hong Kong, and up 0.05% for the week. Forkast’s Ethereum, Polygon and Cardano NFT indexes also logged gains, while the index for Solana dropped.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume rose 28.04% in the past 24 hours to over US$17.71 million, according to data from CryptoSlam. Volumes on the Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, and Cardano blockchains all logged double-digit gains, while volumes on the Bitcoin blockchain shrank.\n\nIn the week ending Aug. 13, NFT sales topped US$101 million after sitting short of US$100 million for three consecutive weeks. NFT transactions for the week exceeded 2.8 million, a high since February 2022.\n\nOn the past week’s surge in NFT sales, Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, said that he saw the emergence of low-priced collections as key to a sustained potential uptick...'}]

So the UX becomes very, very complicated.”\n\nOn the Lightspeed podcast (Spotify/Apple), Yakovenko gives an example from his experience working in Web2 company, Dropbox. “We had one giant MySQL database for all the folders because as soon as you start fragmenting them, [it] becomes very hard to create links between different users of different folders.”\n\n“Tracking consistency between two different databases is a major pain in the ass. You would have to synchronize everything through the [layer-1].”\n\nThe fragmentation, at a large enough scale, causes “massive composability” and user experience problems, according to Yakovenko. “You have to re-sync through the [layer-1] and that’s going to create the same kind of cost.”\n\n“That’s very, very difficult to deal with,” he says.\n\nYakovenko uses the example of NFTs to illustrate the problem. “You can’t have an NFT in every rollup. It actually can only be bridged to one,” he says. “If I want a specific NFT, the marketplace where it’s sold is the marketplace that I need to buy in — and it can only exist in one of those.”\n\nBy creating different states, layer-2s break up the composability of marketplaces for a particular NFT, Yakoveko explains. “That’s the fundamental challenge with [layer-2s].”\n\nIt’s an unavoidable trade-off, he says. “You get a performance benefit because you create this single global lock around a state and then you can work on it asynchronously from everything else, but you’re creating a very hard composability challenge.”\n\nWhat about just one layer-2?\n\nTheoretically, a singular layer-2 solution, rather than the current variety that exists in the Ethereum ecosystem, would simplify the composability problem, Yakovenko says.\n\n“You take [Solana Virtual Machine] that runs as many things in parallel as it can,” he explains. “It always increases hardware capacity to meet the demand.”\n\n“Then, you take all the data and you dump it into danksharding” which ideally would be, he says, the “perfect implementation of a [data availability] layer that tries to maximize its [data availability] system.”\n\n“So you have one [layer-2], one bandwidth-optimized system. That’s basically what Solana is,” he chuckles. “Solana itself can asynchronously execute all the programs, and then pick forks separately in a separate pipeline from execution of the programs.”\n\n“All the forks are quickly picked,” he says, “but then these bigger systems can execute on the programs. You can then do batch [zero-knowledge] verification, if that’s what you need. All that stuff is all doable on Solana.”\n\nYakovenko notes that a “fundamental difference” persists between Solana and multi-layered chain solutions. “There’s not going to be a demand for Solana to do danksharding because that really breaks that idea of information synchrony across the world.”\n\n“I don’t want to split the data availability,” he says. “Even though you might be able to get an improvement in bandwidth there, it actually does still have a trade-off.”\n\nYakovenko believes in the necessity of a system that actively avoids asynchronous solutions. “When I submit one bit here,” he says, “it’s equally observed in Singapore and Brazil, everywhere in the world, as fast as physics allow, because that actually creates value for the world.”\n\nThe goal, Yakovenko explains, is to minimize “information asymmetry between any two players.”\n\n“It allows for fair markets to exist,” he says. “That’s the one core use-case that you really can’t optimize away with all these other systems.”\n\n“The idea of having a single rollup that can take up all of the bandwidth of the data availability layer, whether it’s Solana or Celestia or Ethereum,” he says, “that idea is something that I think a lot of the engineers agree is probably the more efficient design.”\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

The news articles suggest that Solana (SOL) is facing challenges in maintaining its price strength as altcoins collapse, with a potential retest of range lows around $20.31. Additionally, Solana's co-founder, Anatoly Yakovenko, believes that the current proliferation of layer-2 solutions, primarily on Ethereum, may not provide sustainable scaling solutions in the long term due to fragmentation and composability issues. However, the integration of Solana and Ethereum through Neon EVM offers advantages such as low gas fees, parallel execution, and access to the growing Solana market. Overall, the market trend for SOL may be influenced by its ability to address scalability challenges and leverage the benefits of cross-blockchain interoperability through solutions like Neon EVM.

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is experiencing fluctuations but is leaning towards a bullish sentiment. The news analyst report highlights positive developments in the cryptocurrency market, with Solana gaining strength and Bitcoin and Ether showing stability. The NFT market is also growing, indicating overall positive market trends.

Reflecting on the past trading performance, it is evident that prioritizing on-chain data analysis and long-term bullish market trends has been effective. Short-term fluctuations and external factors have led to some loss of profit, emphasizing the importance of a moderately conservative trading approach.

Considering the synthesized reports, the market trend appears to be positive in the long term, with potential for growth in Solana, Bitcoin, Ether, and the NFT market. Therefore, it is advisable to focus on long-term strategies over short-term gains to capitalize on the positive market trends.

Based on this analysis, I would take a trading action with a confidence level of 0.7, indicating a moderately confident stance in the positive long-term market trend.

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is showing signs of bullish sentiment with potential upward movement in price. The successful transactions outweighing the total transactions and recent buy signals from the MACD indicator indicate a positive trend for ETH.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights challenges faced by Solana (SOL) and the potential impact on its market trend. While SOL may face difficulties, the integration of Solana and Ethereum through Neon EVM could offer advantages and influence the market trend for SOL.

Reflecting on the importance of on-chain data analysis and long-term bullish market trends, it is evident that a moderately conservative trading approach is necessary to maximize profits while safeguarding against short-term fluctuations and external factors.

Considering the synthesized reports, the overall market trend appears to favor ETH in the long term. Therefore, it is advisable to maintain a strategic focus on long-term gains rather than short-term fluctuations. 

Based on this analysis, I would recommend a trading action of 0.7, reflecting a high level of confidence in the bullish trend for ETH and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately for long-term profitability.

This decision was announced by the OpenSea team on its official Twitter account.\n\nAt the same time, OpenSea is not leaving BNB Smart Chain completely. Users will still be able to view, discover and transfer BSC NFTs on OpenSea. Regarding the reasons for such a radical step, the OpenSea team admitted that continued support of BSC would not be resource-efficient in the long run:\n\nLast year we added several chains, including BNB Smart Chain (BSC), after seeing excitement from the wider NFT ecosystem. But as our space evolves, we need to align resources with the most promising efforts. We\'ve decided the cost to continue supporting BSC outweighs the impact\n\nHowever, the OpenSea team stressed its commitment to building multi-chain systems.

Both Base and Zora are developed on OP Stack, an Optimism open source framework.\n\nOpenSea was one of the first multi-blockchain marketplaces in Web3 history.

Starting from Aug. 31, 2023, the platform will remove the Operator Filter and make royalties optional for all newly-created collections.\n\nThis reform was met with adamant criticism from some of the industry heavyweights. For instance, OpenSea investor Marc Cuban called the update "a huge mistake."\n\nNot collecting and paying royalties on NFT sales is a HUGE mistake by @opensea.

This provides extra incentive to switch and helps Helium\n\nMobile identify where additional radios will enhance network coverage. Furthermore, the company has plans to scale its services across the United States and other global markets as 5G is slowly rolled out. The company noted that it will automatically upgrade all the Beta users who helped during the testing period to the $5 monthly unlimited plan.\n\n“Coming out of Beta, we’re rolling out Helium Mobile in one city to ensure we provide the best service for our subscribers and can expand people-built coverage locally. It also gives us the ability to organically grow subscribers by fostering a community built by word-of-mouth and bringing down customer acquisition costs altogether,” Helium Network noted in the announcement.\n\nMarket Outlook\n\nThe official launch of the $5 monthly unlimited plan for the Helium network coincided with the August Bitcoin meltdown that took down with it the entire altcoin industry. According to our latest crypto market data, Helium (HNT) price traded around $1.8 on Friday, up approximately 14 percent in the past 4 weeks. Solana (SOL) price on the other hand was down approximately 17 percent in the past four weeks to trade at about $22 on Friday.\n\nRecommended for you:'}, {'id': 3, 'time': 'Sat, 19 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Shiba Inu (SHIB), Solana (SOL), and Pomerdoge (POMD): Top Cryptocurrencies with High-Growth Potential, as per ... - Euro Weekly News', 'content': 'By Guest Writer • Published: 19 Aug 2023 • 17:38\n\nImage: Pomerdoge\n\nAccording to ChatGPT, the AI chatbot, three tokens have captured the attention of both seasoned traders and newcomers: Shiba Inu (SHIB), Solana (SOL), and Pomerdoge (POMD). With innovative features, strong communities, and promising developments, these tokens are worth keeping a close eye on.\n\nSummary\n\nShiba Inu and its journey becoming a full-fledged ecosystem\n\nSolana outpaces both XRP and Dogecoin in liquidity on Coinbase\n\nPomerdoge to dominate the blockchain gaming industry\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB): An Outstanding Meme-Coin\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) made waves as a “meme coin” that garnered significant attention due to its resemblance to Dogecoin. However, Shiba Inu has evolved beyond its meme status with a rapidly growing ecosystem. Moreover, the recent launch of Shibarium, a layer-2 blockchain network, is a testament to the project’s ambition, as per ChatGPT.\n\nDespite some technical challenges, the potential of Shibarium to transform Shiba Inu into an ecosystem has caught trader interest. The Shiba Inu price currently sits at $0.000008594 with a market cap of $5B.\n\nAs the project continues to develop, Shiba Inu’s ability to rebound and surge in value remains a possibility. Thus, experts remain bullish for the Shiba Inu coin. As a result, market experts forecast a surge to $0.00001078 for Shiba Inu by the end of 2023.\n\nSolana (SOL): The Scalability Star\n\nChatGPT says Solana (SOL) has positioned itself as a leading player in blockchain scalability and speed. Its ability to handle a high volume of transactions quickly and cost-effectively has drawn the attention of developers and users alike.\n\nIn recent Solana news, it has surged to become one of the most liquid altcoins on Coinbase, as per Kaiko. As a matter of fact, the Solana crypto outpaced XRP (XRP) and Dogecoin (DOGE) on this metric.\n\nCurrently, Solana is trading hands at $23.23 with a market cap of $9.4B, up 0.24% overnight. Moreover, most of its moving averages are green. Therefore, prominent analysts predict a $29.22 price point for Solana by December 2023.\n\nPomerdoge (POMD): Gaming and Cryptocurrency Mix\n\nThe blockchain gaming industry has grown by 2,000% since Q1 2022, and Pomerdoge (POMD) has taken note. At its core, Pomerdoge and its Play-to-Earn (P2E) crypto game Pomergame empower users to enjoy immersive gameplay and earn rewards in the form of cryptocurrency.\n\nAs per ChatGPT, the Pomerdoge ecosystem has many components bound to excite countless gamers. Firstly, the Pomerplace marketplace can be accessed once users’ characters reach the gold level. In this marketplace, you can purchase or sell valuable items collected during gameplay.\n\nSecondly, the Pomerplace arena provides thrilling battles where users can battle other gamers. And finally, the exclusive 7,777 Pomerdgoe NFT collection will only be available to POMD token holders. While we do not know the benefits of holding these NFTs, excitement is high as buyers are now flocking to the POMD presale.\n\nIt makes sense, as POMD is now worth just $0.008 since it is in Phase One of its presale. But, ChatGPT pointed out that as the presale advances, so will the price. Also, some experts even predict a 17x surge in its price before the presale ends.

article we take a look at the recent launch of the SEI crypto and the airdrop released to early users of the blockchain.\n\nAll those who have used the layer-1 testnet and some active users in the Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Arbitrum, Solana, Polygon and Osmosis networks are eligible to claim the airdrop of the SEI token.\n\nDespite the free cryptocurrencies, many community users have shown their disappointment to the SEI team for a token airdrop in which Binance traders benefited more than ecosystem supporters.\n\nLet’s look at all the details below.\n\nWhat is the Sei crypto project\n\nThe Sei crypto project involves an open source layer-1 blockchain whose purpose is to offer users a better infrastructure than other blockchains out there, capable of handling a higher volume of transactions while meeting high security standards.\n\nSpecifically, this L1 Proof-of-Stake handles 200 times the throughput of Bitcoin, 100 times that of Ethereum, and twice that of the very fast Solana chain.\n\nEven in the realm of execution speed we are on other levels since on average a transaction on Sei is executed in 500ms, while it takes about 60 minutes on Bitcoin, 6 minutes on Ethereum and 2.5 seconds on Solana.\n\nSei’s network is based on Cosmos SDK and uses the “Central Limit Order Book” (CLOB) to handle decentralized finance transactions.\n\nBeing compatible with the inter-blockchain communication (IBC) all dApps that are based on Cosmos can easily land on Sei as well.\n\nOn the interoperability front, the cryptographic network thus seems to be well established, able to open its doors to a myriad of decentralized applications.\n\nAs for CLOB, which is a completely unique innovation in the DeFi field but already present on some CEXs, this method of order optimization manages to match buy and sell prices based on price and time priority.\n\nThe result is transaction optimization and transparency on the slippage front, as well as achieving prevention against frontrun attacks by MEV bots.\n\nOn 15 August, SEI, the native infrastructure token, was officially launched in the mainnet through a launchpool on Binance accompanied by the listing of major cryptocurrency exchanges such as Kucoin, Kraken, Bithumb, Bybit, Huobi and Bitget.\n\nThe chain team, in parallel with the coin’s listing on the exchanges, announced the conduct of an airdrop dedicated to early users of the network in testnet and other active users in other blockchains.\n\nThe Sei Foundation is launching an Airdrop unlike any other 🔑https://t.co/yZldlDbPyg — Sei Foundation (@Sei_FND) August 15, 2023\n\nSEI’s airdrop eligibility criteria: check if you are eligible to receive free crypto\n\nThe much-discussed airdrop of the L1 Sei blockchain provides a set of rewards for two distinct groups of users in the world of decentralized finance.\n\nThe first concerns all those individuals who participated in the “Incentivized Testnet Atlantic 2” event: this is an initiative in which the Six team pushed its community to testnet the crypto network by promising a financial return.\n\nThose who completed all Atlantic 2 tasks and those who were awarded the “top ambassador” rank got a higher allocation as a reward.\n\nTo redeem the airdrop it is necessary to go to Sei’s official website and click on the “rewards” item.\n\nHowever, to check whether you have been selected you must first install the “Compass” wallet and import the account with which you participated in the testent (probably Kepler wallet)\n\nOnce this is done, connect the decentralized wallet and check if you have received a reward: to be safe, connect the Discord account as well.\n\nAnother group of users eligible for the SEI airdrop concerns all those who are considered active users of the Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Solana, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain and Osmosis networks.\n\nIn particular, all users who have processed Wormhole bridged tokens such as arbUSDC, opUSDC, maticUSD, solUSDC as well as those who have used the IBC and Axelar have been rewarded.\n\nAbout 1.5 million addresses were found to be eligible to redeem airdrop tokens, including those who had nothing to do with Sei.\n\nTo check one’s eligibility, it is necessary to go to the official Layer 1 website and click on the “Airdrop” item.\n\nHere again you need to install the Compass wallet and log in with a Sei address since the airdrop is cross-chain: this means that if you have been an active user in one of the networks just mentioned in the past via a MetaMask or Trustwallet, you will get the airdrop on the Compass wallet on the Sei network.\n\nOnce you have connected both of your wallets, by following the directions you will be able to claim the Sei airdrop.\n\nNegative community feedback after the token launch:\n\nThe launch of the SEI token and the associated airdrop for testnet users and active addresses of other layer-1 blockchains triggered a shitstorm against the crypto project team, considering the low rewards and the way it was handled.\n\nThe disappointment of the Sei community was so ...'}]

The news articles highlight a mix of positive and negative developments in the cryptocurrency market. On one hand, there is significant funding raised by various layer-1 blockchains, indicating continued interest and investment in blockchain technology. However, negative news surrounding Logan Paul's CryptoZoo project, where investors are still waiting for refunds after alleged deception, may lead to increased caution and skepticism among investors.

After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market has been experiencing fluctuations in transactions and signals, with a recent buy signal potentially indicating a reversal in the bearish trend. The news analyst report highlights short-term bearish pressure on Solana (SOL) but also emphasizes its long-term potential due to innovative developments and partnerships. The reflection analyst report underscores the importance of monitoring on-chain data, considering market trends, and adopting a moderately conservative trading approach to manage risks effectively.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is evident that while short-term fluctuations and bearish pressures may exist in the market, the long-term outlook for ETH and potentially SOL remains promising.

Based on this analysis, I would take a slightly bullish trading action with a confidence level of 0.3. This decision reflects a cautious optimism in the potential market reversal indicated by the recent buy signal for ETH and the long-term growth prospects highlighted for SOL.

For July-end, SOL’s minimum price is anticipated to be $20.64. The maximum price expected is $23.34 It is anticipated that SOL will trade at an average price of $21.99.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap data, Solana is trading at $21.09, with a 3.35% drop in value over the last 24 hours.'}, {'id': 4, 'time': 'Mon, 21 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Binance Delists Solana (SOL) Pair Amid Regulatory Nightmare - U.Today', 'content': "In a stunning twist, Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, has opted to remove a trading pair involving Solana (SOL) from its offerings. The delisting decision pertains to the perpetual futures linked to Binance's native stablecoin, Binance USD (BUSD), and is scheduled for Aug. 28.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimultaneously, Binance is reducing the maximum leverage for this trading instrument. During the interim period leading to the delisting, the leverage will be halved, capped at 10x. Notably, even investors who held positions before the announcement are not exempt from these changes.\n\nPurge continues\n\nThis move is part of Binance's recent series of actions aimed at streamlining its operations. The exchange has undertaken a systematic cleanup, targeting pairs linked to BUSD, like Litecoin (LTC) and Dogecoin (DOGE), earlier this month. Additionally, instruments with regulatory concerns, such as leveraged tokens linked to Cardano (ADA), have also faced cuts.\n\nThis trend can be traced back to the intensified regulatory scrutiny Binance is currently navigating, particularly from the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) and the SEC. Throughout the year, the exchange has faced multiple high-profile investigations, ushering in a period of contention.\n\nAdding to the saga, Binance has recently halted Euro (EUR) withdrawals and deposits for its European users utilizing the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) system.

This allowed both tokens to flip each other on multiple occasions. A few days ago, SOL flipped DOGE to become the eighth largest crypto. However, the good days did not last long, as DOGE quickly reclaimed its spot. The reason behind this episode was revealed upon a look at their metrics and daily charts.\n\nRead Solana’s [SOL] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nSolana and Dogecoin are neck-to-neck\n\nA look at both the cryptos’ market caps revealed that there were several instances when both flipped each other over the last week.

This was evident from the drop in SOL’s weighted sentiment, while the same metric for DOGE remained high.\n\nDogecoin last flipped Solana on 18 August to claim its spot. The 4-hour chart of DOGE showed what helped the memecoin.\n\nDuring that time frame, DOGE’s MACD displayed a bullish crossover. Its Money Flow Index (MFI) also registered a sharp uptick, helping the coin to marginally increase its value.\n\nWill Solana be able to beat DOGE?\n\nWhile DOGE’s price went up by more than 1% in the last 24 hours, SOL only managed to push its price up by 0.18%. Nonetheless, a few of the metrics were bullish on SOL, suggesting a further price uptick in the days to follow.\n\nAs per Santiment’s chart, SOL’s open interest dropped substantially. A decline in the metric usually means that the on-going price trend might end soon. Moreover, Solana’s DyDx and Binance funding rates were red, further increasing the chances of a trend reversal.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Dogecoin Profit Calculator\n\nHowever, a look at SOL’s daily chart painted a bearish picture. The distance between the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the 55-day EMA was shrinking, indicating a possible bearish crossover soon.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) was also resting below the neutral mark. This meant that the chances of SOL going ahead of DOGE in the near term were unlikely.

The pool currently accepts deposits of USDC-SPL and passes yield sourced from one-month US Treasury bills — minus fees — to lenders.\n\nMaple’s 15 lending pools have facilitated more than $2 billion in corporate loans since the company launched in May 2021. It launched on Solana last year, facilitating the issuance of roughly $125 million in loans on the blockchain before the development pause in December.\n\nRead more: Maple Finance scoops up lending protocol Avari to hasten launch on Solana\n\n“Maple’s return to Solana signifies a strategic choice that goes beyond mere business considerations,” Powell told Blockworks. “Builders continue to launch new Solana protocols and investors continue to back them.”\n\nThe company sees a number of positive catalysts for Solana’s growth, Powell added, such as Firedancer, an independent validator client for the blockchain that is built by Jump.\n\n“As Solana continues to expand and attract new protocols, there is a growing need for products that can generate low-risk yield opportunities for stablecoins,” the Maple CEO said.\n\nOthers have sought to offer on-chain investors access to US Treasury yields. Adapt3r Digital launched a tokenized Treasury-focused fund on decentralized marketplace Archblock last week, while Ondo Finance introduced tokenized US Treasurys and bond offerings in January.\n\nThe Solana re-launch comes after Maple introduced its cash management pool in April.

This, in turn, can often be a major hurdle for new entrants, it said.\n\nThe one-click sign-in method, available as of Phantom version 23.11, allows Solana developers to prompt users to connect and sign a standardized authentication message and prove ownership of their addresses.\n\nDesigned as a drop-in replacement for the previous two-step authentication flow, the sign-in method also provides developers with a robust API for creating standardized authentication messages, Phantom said.\n\nThe responsibility for message construction shifts from applications to the wallet, allowing Phantom to scrutinize elements such as the site’s domain or the time of message issuance to ensure legitimacy.\n\nIt is unclear whether there could be fresh privacy concerns associated with the shift of responsibility in message construction. Blockworks has reached out to Phantom for comment.\n\nIn some instances, that construction may help slow or hinder the progress of malicious actors. That could help prevent instances like last year’s breach, when a coding error allowed hackers to easily find and use client passwords, leading to a breach in both Slope and Phantom wallets.\n\nPrivate keys associated with the impacted wallets were either leaked or compromised, and these keys were then utilized to authorize fraudulent transactions, according to reports at the time.\n\nThe sign-in feature released on Monday makes authentication more consistent and allows Phantom to check for suspicious activity, its developers said.\n\nEthereum dapps similarly can facilitate a “sign in with Ethereum” feature using Ethereum Name Service (ENS), as part of a push for decentralized identity services.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

The platform intends to aid users who wish to trade their assets without revealing personal information about themselves.\n\nThe core infrastructure for the tool has been under development for over a year, and is now available through a web app and supports transfers to other crypto wallets in solana (SOL), USD Coin (USDC), tether (USDT), bonk (BONK) and samoyedcoin (SAMO).\n\nExpansion to other ecosystems outside of Solana is being considered, according to Elusiv co-founder Julian Deschler.\n\nTo use it, people have to connect their wallet and top up their “private balance” to their desired amount. Then, when it’s time to make a transaction, the private swap functionality encrypts the user’s public key while also generating a temporary key. That temporary key sends the transaction, thereby obscuring the user’s trading habits.\n\n“This enables users to swap assets with complete privacy, as token pairs and amounts can never link to a user’s wallet address. This increases users’ security, hides trading strategies and protects those making frequent swaps or exchanging large quantities,” Elusiv shared in a statement.\n\nElusiv also pointed out that making trades on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are not the end all be all for privacy, as data is scraped from them and published on block explorers.\n\nDeschler said this tool is crucial to make DeFi fair for everyone, including regular users and seasoned traders.\n\n“Private token swaps secure one of the most fundamental actions in all of DeFi and push the entire Web3 space forward to deliver on core values of self-sovereignty and data ownership,” Deschler said in a statement.\n\nThe idea of obscuring crypto transactions isn’t at all new. Crypto mixers such as Tornado Cash have been around for years. CoinJoin was released in 2013, and it performed a similar function to mixers but was specific to Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, \u200b\u200bDeschler told Blockworks that Elusiv doesn’t mix user funds, adding that Elusiv is more akin to privacy protocols Aztec and Railgun.\n\n“We utilize a combination of cryptographic schemes, most notably zk-SNARKs to bring privacy guarantees to users,” \u200b\u200bDeschler said. “Mixers, on the other hand, present notable differences in their privacy assurances, programmability, and foundational structure.”\n\nMixers have also run into legal trouble. Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev was arrested last summer after authorities suspected him of facilitating money laundering. Before Pertsev’s arrest, the US Treasury sanctioned Tornado Cash, making it impossible for Americans to interact with it.\n\n\u200b\u200bDeschler said Elusiv has “not been met with any legal hurdles,” adding that his team is engaged with the European Crypto Initiative’s efforts to develop fair regulation.\n\nStart your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

The statue was on loan to the city for a year as part of the 2022 Temporary Public Art Program before Harmetz donated her to the city for keeps earlier this year.\n\nThe bronze sculptor has also been a cosmetic dentist for 50 years with a practice in La Jolla, Harmetz & Kim.\n\n“I never really thought of myself as an artist, even when I did that piece,” he said. “ I always think of myself as a dentist.”\n\nHarmetz did the artwork on Rio nearly 20 years ago. He spent a total of 16 months sculpting the clay while working his day job as a dentist and the sculpture spent another seven months at the foundry to be cast in bronze.\n\n“I’m glad she has a permanent home where she is appreciated,” said Harmetz. Rio’s new home on Pacific Avenue is actually right down the street from where Harmetz bought his first house on Pacific Avenue in 1976. He used to go to the Tide Beach Park all the time when his son was little, back when the beach access was a rickety wooden staircase.\n\nFrom Solana Beach the family moved to the edge of Rancho Santa Fe where they lived for many years—one of his son Adam’s early claims to fame was being one of the kids to co-name Solana Santa Fe School when it opened in 1993. Harmetz and his wife Pat, a special education teacher for over 35 years, now reside in Carmel Valley.\n\nHarmetz didn’t start sculpting until he was around 40 years old. As a dentist, he had done a lot of meticulous lab work, shaping crowns and perfecting smiles. He started dabbling in making jewelry and gold figurines before deciding he wanted to try his hand at sculpting 35 years ago when he was driving by a Michaels. Armed with a glue gun and some Styrofoam, he gave it a go.\n\nUp until three years ago, he used to sculpt in his office in his free hours—that’s where Rio was formed—but now he has his own art studio in the Del Mar village.\n\nSculpture can be a long, long process, often starting with just some PVC pipes and clay.\n\n“You look at it and you think ‘God, where do I start?’ It’s very hard, it’s very physical,” he said “The clay is hard as rock, you get blisters and keep working at it and working at it and finally you have something.”\n\nBefore Rio,Harmetz had done a large sculpture called “Healing Love” depicting a man’s love for a woman who had battled breast cancer, showing a mastectomy scar. The sculpture has been on display for many years at Sharp Memorial Hospital—“I was thrilled to death when Sharp asked for it, I was just beside myself,” he said. He has also done a 9-foot polished bronze dolphin named “Hope” which was donated to the city of Orange Beach, Alabama following the BP oil spill caused by the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig.\n\n“It still doesn’t come easy to me. I don’t have a particular style, I like doing figurative work,” he said. “I have done small landscapes and oceanscapes, I try to do things that haven’t been done.”\n\nRio is just about life-size—the model was a woman from La Jolla named Paula who was 6 feet tall but the bronze is just 5’10. After he did the sculpture Paula ended up moving away and she never did see the completed project.\n\nWhen the city of Solana Beach put out the call for artists a couple years ago, he offered up Rio and was happy when she was selected and chosen for placement at the popular beach site. The sculpture was one of four temporary art installations that include spots such as the Seascape Sur Beach public beach access, Lomas Santa Fe Drive and Solana Beach Town Centre.\n\nRichard Harmetz’s “Rio” in Solana Beach. (Richard Harmetz)\n\nHarmetz said he wasn’t sure what the reaction would be and even called every few days to check if people were saying anything bad. After a year of Rio on the beach, he offered to donate the sculpture, which cost him $32,000 to make, not including his time sculpting it.\n\n“I just like the idea of having the piece out in public,” he said.“It’s a fun thing doing this.”\n\nHamertz said there are many things about Rio that people may not even notice at first glance, like how the base is slanted like the beach or the pareo that is clasped in her hand and blowing in the wind behind her—he reveals that to make that mold of the flowing fabric, he floated mylar balloons and poured super glue over it.\n\nIn the studio right now, Hamertz is working a life-size female MMA fighter, working to portray a woman as a warrior and the courage and discipline it takes to get into the octagon. So far he’s only done two feet and two legs—he estimates it will take a year to sculpt it and he won’t have it bronzed unless he has a buyer.\n\nOver the years, however, Hamertz has never made art for money or just to be sold—he has gifted a...'}]

This strategic integration allows millions of businesses on Shopify’s platform to leverage Solana Pay for crypto transactions with zero transaction fees until 2024.\n\nA post on the Solana official X profile, linking to a TechCrunch article read;\n\n“Today, Solana Pay integrates with Shopify, empowering the millions of entrepreneurs and merchants on Shopify to accept fast, web3 native payments with no transaction fees through the end of 2023.”\n\nLaunched in Feb. 2022, Solana Pay is built on Solana, and the initial payment option for this integration is USDC, the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization. The choice of USDC, as Josh Fried of Solana Foundation told TechCrunch, is strategic, given its close ties to the dollar and its regulatory oversight. However, he hinted at future considerations for adding SOL.\n\nSolPay is also integrated into the Solana Saga mobile phone and available on any device connected to a Solana wallet. The Saga had its price slashed at the start of August to just $599, down from $999 at launch.\n\nSolana and Shopify partnership benefits.\n\nOver 11 million active accounts on Solana will potentially gain access to Shopify businesses, which, according to TechCrunch, make up 10% of total U.S. e-commerce and $444 billion of global economic activity. However, companies will likely have to activate Solana Pay in their merchants’ dashboards to accept payments.\n\nFried reiterated to TechCrunch the vital role of payments in the crypto space, stating,\n\n“Some people argue the killer app for crypto hasn’t arrived, but it has: it’s payments.”\n\nThis sentiment reflects the hope of shifting towards decentralized payment platforms that aim to reduce business transaction costs. Credit card processing fees usually cost a business up to 5% per transaction. In contrast, the average cost per transaction on Solana’s blockchain is one-fortieth of a cent.\n\nThe partnership could also enable merchants to set up loyalty programs with minimal development effort. According to Fried, these reward systems could be as simple as launching NFT loyalty tokens that are burnt when a consumer checks out using Solana Pay.\n\nThis development, however, comes amid the backdrop of significant changes within the crypto market landscape, as some major cryptocurrencies, including SOL, were recently delisted by Robinhood, Bitstamp, and Revolut following SEC lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance.\n\nMentioned in this article'}, {'id': 7, 'time': 'Wed, 23 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Solana Pay Integrates With Shopify to Enable Decentralized Payments - PYMNTS.com', 'content': 'Solana Pay, a decentralized payments protocol built on the Solana blockchain network, has integrated with Shopify, offering millions of businesses a new payment solution.\n\nThis collaboration allows merchants to have real-time access to their funds and greater control over working capital, liquidity and liability protection, the Solana Foundation said in a Wednesday (Aug. 23) press release. By eliminating intermediaries, Solana Pay eliminates bank fees, chargebacks and holding times, while enabling immediate payment settlement using USD stablecoins compatible with the Solana network.\n\nJosh Fried, head of commerce business development at the Solana Foundation, said in the release that the integration of Solana Pay on Shopify opens up numerous possibilities for merchants and consumers alike.\n\n“Solana Pay on Shopify opens up millions of merchants to a more dynamic and efficient payment choice, while consumers get the convenience and increased utility of being able to pay for goods and services with digital dollar currencies from the vast network of merchants using Shopify,” Fried said.\n\nOne of the key advantages of adopting Solana Pay is the gateway it provides to Web3-enabled commerce experiences, according to the press release. These experiences include token-gated offers, simple cross-border payments and non-fungible token (NFT)-based loyalty programs. By embracing Solana Pay, businesses can cater to their Web3-savvy customers and tap into the growing demand for Web3-native payment options.\n\nThe decentralized Solana network upon which Solana Pay is built is known for its high transaction speeds, near-zero fees and sustainability, the release said.\n\nSeveral prominent brands that are already active on Solana, such as MonkeDAO, MadLads, Helius and Solana’s merch store, have committed to integrating Solana Pay as a payment option in their Shopify-powered storefronts, per the release. By offering Solana Pay, these brands recognize the opportunity to provide their customers with a Web3-native payment solution, aligning with the evolving landscape of digital commerce.\n\nSolana Pay was launched in February 2022 as a low-cost, instant crypto-payment tool for everyday purchases.

USDC, the second-largest stablecoin with a market capitalization of $25.9 billion, will be the initial payment option for this integration, Josh Fried, business development and partnerships at Solana Foundation, told TechCrunch.\n\nGoing with USDC first wasn’t unintentional. Most merchants are probably more willing to accept something so closely tied to the dollar. USDC is also more regulated than, say, many altcoins, and consumers in general are already used to transacting in digital dollars. But the protocol will consider adding cryptocurrencies like SOL and BONK in the future, Fried said.\n\nShopify accounts for 10% of total U.S. e-commerce and $444 billion worth of global economic activity, according to its website. The Solana ecosystem has over 11.5 million active accounts; Solana Pay has been adopted by big crypto names like Circle and Phantom as well as payment processors like Checkout.com and Citcon.\n\n“Some people argue the killer app for crypto hasn’t arrived, but it has: it’s payments,” Fried said. “[Everyone] should be doubling down on this.”\n\nCredit card processing fees usually cost a business between 1.5% and 3.5% per transaction, but using the Solana Pay option is practically “fee-free,” Fried said. The average cost per transaction on Solana’s blockchain is $0.00025, or fractions of a penny. Of course, Solana has dealt with downtime issues in the past, which in itself has a cost. But the blockchain reported 100% uptime in Q2, so things are getting better. It’s also worth noting that Shopify also entered the credit card space in July by launching its own business credit card for merchants.\n\nThe integration can also help merchants set up loyalty programs with “little development,” Fried said. These reward systems can be as simple as launching NFT loyalty tokens that would transpire when a consumer checks out and if they return to buy something again and use Solana Pay, the store can give them a discount.\n\nA few crypto-focused teams and brands like Helius, Mad Lads and MonkeDAO have also agreed to integrate Solana Pay on their Shopify storefronts, Fried shared. Any Solana-centric crypto wallet that has integrated with Solana Pay, like Phantom, Solflare and Glow, will be able to connect to the plug-in.\n\nShopify isn’t a stranger to crypto payment options, either. In February, it launched a number of blockchain-enabled commerce tools and features to help merchants build tokengating applications. Shopify already integrates with other payment applications like Coinbase Commerce, Strike, Crypto.com and BitPay.\n\nIn general, Solana Labs sees its blockchain as “perfectly suited for payments,” Fried said. There’s no intermediaries, bank fees, chargebacks and holding times, he said. “You need speed at the point of sale for merchant payments. No one wants to sit on a website to wait for wallet transactions. Similarly in a point of sale in a store, can you imagine waiting three minutes for your payment to go through? No one wants to do that.”'}]

This guarantees compliance with the future MiCA framework, and provides a high level of security for users. Stablecoin can be issued and spent free of charge, in a 1:1 ratio with the euro.\n\nMore good news: EUROe is already enjoying massive adoption. Since its launch, stablecoin has been supported by Wirex, a well-known crypto payment app. Its 6 million users can now use their EUROe at over 40 million merchants!\n\nWirex also makes it possible to instantly exchange EUROe for over a hundred different currencies. This makes it the perfect tool for widespread daily use of EUROe.\n\nAccording to Pavel Matveev, co-founder of Wirex, “the arrival of EUROe on Solana guarantees optimum flexibility for managing your finances”.\n\nTowards the future of finance\n\nWith its speed, low costs and reliability, Solana represents the ideal terrain for a digital currency.

However, with the market’s volatility, users should exercise caution.\n\nSummary\n\nSolana endured a challenging 2022, facing network troubles and NFT departures that led to a significant drop in SOL's price.\n\nPromising indicators suggest a potential recovery for Solana, with improved scalability, a thriving DeFi and NFT ecosystem, and strong developer and investor support.\n\nDespite positive signs, caution is advised due to market volatility. Solana's rebound remains uncertain, though it stands poised to attract new users and developers.\n\nSolana faced a tough year in 2022, encountering network outages, links to the FTX crypto exchange's collapse, and the departure of NFT collections like DeGods and y00ts to other blockchains. Consequently, the SOL price plummeted by over 90% from its peak of $260.06.\n\nThat said, there have been some promising signs for optimism as the protocol looks to re-establish itself as a leading player in the Layer 1 ecosystem. As of writing, Solana trades at $20.70, but is there a chance for a potential bull run? This article explores the blockchain’s progress and potential for a positive recovery.\n\nReasons for optimism around Solana\n\n1. Enhanced Scalability and Reliability\n\nSolana has taken significant strides in improving its scalability and reliability. Transactions per second (TPS) have notably increased, and the network has enjoyed months free of significant outages.\n\nSolana maintained 4K+ TPS in the last seven days | Solscan\n\n2. Thriving DeFi and NFT Ecosystem\n\nSolana remains a favored platform for DeFi and NFT projects. Its vibrant community of developers and users keeps it bustling with activity.\n\n\u200d\n\n3. Strong Developer and Investor Support\n\nA robust team of developers and investors backs Solana, with the Solana Foundation dedicated to long-term project success.\n\nPositive Indicators in Recent Months\n\nSolana has recently exhibited some impressive metrics. Solana’s TVL has recovered somewhat from lows of around $200 million, in late 2022, to now reach approximately the $310 million mark, according to data from DefiLlama. Certainly, this remains magnitudes lower than highs of more than $10 billion in November 2022, but a more than 50% increase in just a handful of months is no small feat.\n\nAdditionally, the count of daily active addresses on Solana has been encouraging, with over 240,000 active wallet addresses recorded in a week. The Layer1 blockchain, designed for mass adoption, also observed more than 350,000 unique wallet addresses interacting with it sometime in August.\n\nNumber of daily active addresses in the last seven days | Solscan\n\nThe Path Ahead for Solana\n\nThese positive trends position Solana as a prominent player in the blockchain ecosystem. Still, it's premature to determine if the project will fully recover from past setbacks. The market's volatility and various influencing factors could sway SOL's price.\n\nNonetheless, Solana is poised to attract new users and developers, reestablishing its influence in the DeFi and NFT sectors.\n\nBalancing Optimism with Caution\n\nOverall, a mix of optimism and caution shrouds Solana's future. While its potential is evident, challenges need overcoming for it to thrive truly. Time holds the key to whether Solana can achieve a rebound in 2023 and beyond."}]

Meanwhile, they will continue to cover news related to Bitcoin and Ethereum, two of the world’s most valuable crypto platforms and pioneers in their respective fields.\n\nAs of August 26, it could not be ascertained why CNBC dropped Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin. However, what’s evident is that they have been on the receiving end in recent days, and their valuation has been suffering in the past few years.\n\nSOL In, BCH And LTC Out\n\nDespite posting impressive gains in July, BCH has recoiled as the hype around the approval of a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States faded. Bitcoin and BCH rose earlier after BlackRock applied for a Bitcoin spot ETF with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Meanwhile, Litecoin is down days after halving its miner rewards in early August.\n\nSubsequently, BCH and LTC are no longer in the top 10 by market capitalization and have emerging smart contracts and transactional networks that have taken positions in recent years. LTC and BCH have a market capitalization of around $4.8 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively, and are among the top 20 most valuable coins at 16th and 18th in the leaderboard.\n\nOn the other hand, Solana is perched at 9th in the market cap leaderboard, commanding a valuation of $8.3 billion. The network is ahead of Tron, at 10th, with 6.9 billion. SOL is also closing in on Dogecoin and Cardano, whose market cap stands at $8.8 and $9.1 billion, respectively.\n\nRise Of NFT Activity And Solana Pay\n\nThat CNBC chose to cover SOL and dismiss BCH and LTC has triggered discussions in social media platforms. On X, one user said the decision was an endorsement for Solana. He pointed to the developments “behind the scenes,” including the spike in non-fungible token (NFT) activity.\n\nIn early July, the number of NFTs minted on Solana surpassed those generated from Ethereum for the first time since May 2022. The surge could be attributed to Solana’s high scalability, which translates to low transaction fees, benefiting creators. OpenSea and Rarible, two of the world’s popular NFT marketplaces, supported Solana NFTs in 2022. With their support, it becomes easier for users to trade, which could further boost blockchain activity.\n\nBeyond NFTs, Solana Pay, a payment solution, is finding traction. Early this week, Shopify, a leading ecommerce platform, integrated Solana Pay for users to settle USDC payments easily. Circle, the issuer of USDC, and Checkout, a payment processor, have supported Solana Pay.\n\nFeatured image from Canva, chart from TradingView'}, {'id': 5, 'time': 'Sat, 26 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Solana NFTs: All about surging volumes and shifting dynamics - AMBCrypto News', 'content': 'Solana NFT volume has surged over 120% in the last 24 hours.\n\nSolana Blue Chip NFT Index has also seen a 10% increase in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe Solana [SOL] NFT space has experienced a surge in activity over the past few days, as recent data indicates. How has this recent uptick in activity affected the NFT trade volume and the value of SOL?\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 SOLs worth today?\n\nSolana NFT volume surges\n\nAs of 24 August, according to a post by Step Data Insights, Solana emerged with the highest NFT sales volume within the last 24 hours. The post unveiled a nearly 20% surge in sales volume for Solana, in contrast to Ethereum [ETH], which experienced approximately a 3.4% increase during the same duration.\n\nHowever, a more comprehensive analysis of the volume data on Crypto Slam revealed a more substantial escalation in sales volume. As of this writing, the sales volume had skyrocketed by over 124% within the past 24 hours.\n\nFurthermore, while Solana trailed behind Ethereum regarding trade volume denominated in USD, it outpaced Ethereum regarding the number of sales within the same timeframe. As of this writing, the cumulative sales volume had accrued to approximately $2.2 million.\n\nAnalyzing the Solana 7-day NFT volume\n\nAccording to insights gathered from Solana Floor, it was evident that the surge in activity was not confined solely to daily trading volumes; the seven-day trading volume also experienced a positive upswing. As of this writing, the seven-day volume had escalated by 12%, amassing nearly $5 million in USD volume.\n\nIn addition, the Solana Blue Chip NFT Index indicated a notable 10% surge within the last 24 hours. However, it was worth noting that this increase remained below the threshold it had reached earlier in the month.\n\nFurthermore, the statistics from Solana Floor highlighted that Mad Labs had established itself as the top NFT collection on the network. As of this writing, it had a cumulative floor value surpassing $11 million, with the second-highest floor value coming at over $8 million.\n\nHow does this impact the total SOL NFT trade volume?\n\nDespite the impressive surge in total volume, the SOL NFT trade volume, as indicated by Santiment data, remained unaffected. As of this writing, the cumulative trade volume denominated in USD barely surpassed $2,600.\n\nThis figure presented a stark divergence from the average volume of around $5 million observed before the significant decline around July.\n\nHowever, an improvement could be seen if the ongoing spike in trading volume maintains its momentum. In that case, there was a possibility that the USD trade volume could revisit the region where it had been prominent several months earlier.\n\nThis suggests a potential resurgence in trading activity if the current trend continues.'}]

The move will enable millions of businesses operating on the Shopify platform to leverage Solana Pay for their payment needs.\n\nInitially, USDC payments will be accepted via the integration, but more crypto-assets will added down the line.\n\nSolana Pay x Shopify\n\nAccording to the official press release, Solana Pay will essentially eliminate bank fees, chargebacks, and holding times while allowing immediate, direct payment settlement of USD stablecoins compatible with Solana.\n\nFurthermore, merchants and consumers using Solana Pay will also be able to benefit from Web3-enabled commerce experiences, such as token-gated offers, simple cross-border payments, as well as NFT-based loyalty programs.\n\nCommenting on the development, Solana Foundation’s Head of Commerce Business Development, Josh Fried, said,\n\n“Solana Pay on Shopify opens up millions of merchants to a more dynamic and efficient payment choice, while consumers get the convenience and increased utility of being able to pay for goods and services with digital dollar currencies from the vast network of merchants using Shopify.”\n\nLaunched in February 2022, Solana Pay is an open-source protocol built on top of the layer-1 blockchain Solana. The initial payment option for its integration with Shopify will include USDC, the second-largest stablecoin with a market capitalization of nearly $26 billion.\n\nIn a statement provided to TechCrunch, Fried explained that the choice of USDC was deliberate and was influenced by the fact that most merchants are likely to be more receptive to adopting a payment method closely linked to the stability of the US Dollar.\n\nHe went on to add that Circle’s USDC, being subject to higher regulatory oversight compared to other crypto-assets, holds a level of familiarity among consumers already accustomed to transacting in digital dollars. However, Solana Pay remains open to the possibility of incorporating other crypto-assets, including SOL and BONK, into its offerings in the near future.\n\nSolana: 6 Months Without Outage\n\nThe Solana blockchain experienced significant disruptions caused by recurrent outages, some of which persisted for more than a day. However, the subsequent upgrades, such as the implementation of QUIC TPU, Stake weighted QoS, and localized free markets, have improved the network’s capacity to manage substantial traffic and meet demand.\n\nAs a result, Solana maintained uninterrupted service for the past six months and has been 100% uptime since February.'}, {'id': 7, 'time': 'Sun, 27 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Cryptocurrency Price Today: Bitcoin, Ethereum See Losses As Toncoin Becomes Top Gainer - ABP Live', 'content': 'Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) — two of the most valued crypto coins — managed to remain above the $26,000 and $16,000 marks, respectively, on early Sunday morning.

It faded in 1997, but he revived it in 2013, and spent several years playing The King, including at concerts at the Del Mar Fairgrounds.\n\nDuring the pandemic, he and his wife, Heather, wrote lyrics for videos filmed in a bedroom closet at their home and posted on social media.\n\nNow, he recites a little of the history of the Mississippi-born Buffett, now 76, a boatsman and pilot who’s had some harrowing accidents in his career. “We might not be here today,” Maddox said, drawing laughs from his band by saying they might have had to switch to imitating the music of rock band Bon Jovi.\n\nThe other members of the band are:\n\nCraig Harris, bass guitar, from Carlsbad. He’s been playing almost 55 years — since he was 17 years old. He’s just retired as a wood restorer. “It’s so much fun,” Harris said of playing in the Buffett tribute band. “It reaches people. The energy is infectious. It’s a wonderful experience.”\n\nJoe Tavano, a keyboardist and songwriter since the 1990s. He’s headed his own tribute and cover bands as well. His synthesizer adds sounds, like from a trumpet, to the mix. An attorney, he lives in Bonita.\n\nIvan Rios, the youngest, a tailor from Escondido, who said Buffett’s music “makes people dance. It makes them happy. They seem to respond. For me to play in this band is amazing, really fun.”\n\nJohn Brengle — the name is familiar to North County folks because his grandfather deeded to the city of Vista the land for Brengle Terrace Park. He now lives in the San Carlos area of San Diego. He’s in outside sales for a petroleum company. “I love Jimmy Buffett,” Brengle said.\n\nThe shows, Maddox explained, are more than audio. They’re visual as well.\n\nRe-creating the look of the islands reflected in much of Buffett’s music, the props include swaying palm trees, tiki towers, dancing sharks, beach balls and lots of bubbles.\n\nVisit bellyup.com for more information on the Sept. 8 event.'}]

They have discovered four new tarantula species in a largely uncharted “biodiversity hotspot” in the Colombian Pacific region.\n\nThe Chocó Biogeographic Region, rich in tropical rainforests and mangroves, not only attracts tourists but also holds the key to conserving its unique ecosystem.\n\nResearchers embarked on an expedition at the Jardín Botánico del Pacífico (JBP) in Bahía Solano to study a group of spiders known as Mygalomorphae. This includes the likes of tarantulas, trapdoor spiders, and funnel-web spiders, among others. These spiders are primarily terrestrial, predatory, and often have a limited geographical presence.\n\nDuring their search, the team uncovered Ummidia solana, a unique trapdoor spider, and three tarantula species: Euthycaelus cunampia, Neischnocolus mecana, and Melloina pacifica.\n\n“These taxonomic breakthroughs represent the first recorded instances of their respective genera in the region, expanding their geographical distribution,” the researchers report in a media release.\n\n“Each species was meticulously illustrated, described, and scientifically discussed, offering valuable insights into their morphological characteristics, taxonomy, and biogeography. The results of this study serve as a significant contribution to our understanding of the region’s biological diversity, known for its exceptional species richness and endemism.”\n\nDelving deeper into their findings, researchers unveiled:\n\nUmmidia solana is named after Bahía Solano and marks the debut record of the Ummidia genus in the Chocó Biogeographic Region.\n\n\n\nMelloina pacifica is the first-ever described species of the Melloina genus in Colombia. Its habitat, the Colombian Pacific region, inspired its name.\n\n\n\nEuthycaelus cunampia honors two Emberá indigenous community members, Don José and Don Antonio, who shifted from hunting traditions to guiding tourists and scholars at the JBP. This discovery is significant, marking the first instance of the Euthycaelus genus and the subfamily Schismatothelinae outside specific Colombian regions.\n\n\n\nNeischnocolus mecana , named after a Bahía Solano township, is the fourth known species of its genus in Colombia and the first in the Chocó region and the Colombian Pacific.\n\n\n\nThe group emphasized the need for more in-depth taxonomic research due to the vast undiscovered species that potentially exist in the region.\n\nThe study was published in the journal ZooKeys.\n\nYou might also be interested in:'}, {'id': 10, 'time': 'Mon, 28 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Cryptocurrency Price Today: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Other Top Coins Trade Sideways, dYdX Becomes Top Gainer - ABP Live', 'content': "Bitcoin (BTC), the oldest and most valued cryptocurrency in the world, managed to remain above the $26,000 mark as top coins register minor movements.

Market sentiments improved following optimistic remarks by JPMorgan analysts, which indicate a potential end to Bitcoin's downward trend and injected positivity into the market landscape. This view gains further credibility due to the declining open interest in Bitcoin futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, signalling the potential conclusion of prolonged liquidation processes. In contrast, Ethereum's current trading stands at roughly $1,650. The weekend also saw criticism from crypto Twitter following the US Treasury Department’s new proposal on handling digital asset taxes.”\n\nParth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead, CoinSwitch Ventures, said, “The crypto market held steady over the weekend. As per CoinGecko, the global crypto market capitalisation is up 0.2 percent in the last 24 hours and continues to remain above $1 trillion. The crypto fear and greed index continues to be in the fear zone with a score of 39/100, a point up since yesterday. Crypto investors are cautious, even though downward price action seems to be slowing down.”\n\nRajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, offered his take, “Amidst upcoming data on July’s personal consumption expenditure, the market seems to have bounced back from the slump of the last few weeks. Potential interest rate hikes which could be determined over the next few days, could be a catalyst for price movements of key tokens. Altcoins haven’t demonstrated any significant price movement to determine the onset of an alt season.”\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, “Bitcoin recently crossed $26,000, sparking investment discussions. While its value has fallen slightly, concerns about the impending financial crisis and inflation remain. Economist Peter Schiff warns of a crisis before the US central bank controls inflation. Despite Bitcoin's prominent position, the US dollar still dominates global payments — SWIFT data confirms. Cardano's creator, Charles Hoskinson, predicts that it will outperform Bitcoin and Ethereum due to its unique features. However, the value of ADA continues to stagnate. Amidst the volatility, Bitcoin's technicals appear stable, trading between $25,500 and $27,000 with the potential to rise to $27,400 or even $28,650.”\n\nShivam Thakral, the CEO of BuyU..."}]

The news articles indicate a mixed market sentiment in the cryptocurrency space. While Solana-based startup Clockwork is shutting down due to limited commercial upside, the discovery of new tarantula species in Colombia's biodiversity hotspot highlights the importance of conservation efforts. In terms of cryptocurrency prices, Bitcoin remains above $26,000 with minor movements, while Ethereum, Dogecoin, Ripple, Litecoin, and Solana trade sideways. The dYdX token emerges as the top gainer, while THETA is the biggest loser. Overall, the global crypto market cap stands at $1.05 trillion with a slight 24-hour gain. Analysts suggest cautious optimism in the market, with potential interest rate hikes and upcoming data on personal consumption expenditure influencing price movements.

Clockwork Next Project to Shut Down - Crypto Briefing', 'content': 'Share this article URL Copied\n\nJoining other Solana-based projects that have recently shut down, Clockwork, an automation network for smart contracts, has announced it will cease development. The reasons cited for the decision include “opportunity costs” and “limited commercial upside”.\n\nHi all, bittersweet news today. The team and I behind @clockwork_xyz have decided to step away from active development of the protocol. 1/ — Nick (@time_composer) August 27, 2023\n\nNick Garfield, the founder of Clockwork, said that the team had decided to stop developing the protocol. Clockwork will be switching off their nodes on both devnet and mainnet, effective October 31.\n\nClockwork automates smart contract transactions based on conditions, events, or schedules predefined by users.\n\nThe decision to stop development comes after a $4 million seed funding round last year. The round was led by Multicoin Capital and Asymmetric.\n\n“We still have a meaningful portion of our seed funding. Fully shutting down is an option, but I need to take a minute to reset myself before deciding one way or the other,” Garfield said in a Twitter thread.\n\nClockwork follows in the footsteps of several Solana-based platforms that have shut down in recent months. Friktion, a DeFi yield farming platform, halted operations in January. Everlend, a DeFi lender, followed suit in February. The NFT marketplace, Formfunction, shut down in March. And just last month, Cardinal, which develops tools for Solana NFTs, put an end to its development.\n\nThis wave of shutdowns comes after the migration of some top Solana projects to other chains last year. In 2022, Solana’s two top projects by transaction volume, y00ts, and DeGods, moved from Solana to Polygon and Ethereum, respectively. Likewise, gaming platform Fractal, co-founded by the creator of Twitch, also made the switch from Solana to Polygon.\n\nThe Solana ecosystem appears to feel the ripple effects of FTX’s downfall, as a significant portion of its support came from customer deposits funneled into Solana projects by Alameda Research and FTX Ventures.'}, {'id': 8, 'time': 'Tue, 29 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Solana-Based Clockwork to Cease Operations: 'Limited Commercial Upside' Cited - Coinnounce", 'content': 'Clockwork, a Solana-based smart contract automation project, is set to halt its operations by the end of October due to what the team describes as "limited commercial upside."\n\nStrategic Decision Amidst Limited Prospects\n\nClockwork\'s Closure Decision\n\nClockwork, a project built on Solana\'s blockchain, is preparing to shut down its key infrastructure in October. The project\'s founder, Nick Garfield, took to Twitter on August 27 to announce the cessation of active development for the protocol. The nodes on both devnet and mainnet will be turned off on October 31.\n\nOpportunity Cost and Diverse Interests\n\nReasoning Behind the Decision\n\nGarfield attributed the decision to a "simple opportunity cost," suggesting that the team found limited commercial viability in continuing the development of Clockwork. He acknowledged that the team had an increasing interest in exploring alternative opportunities beyond the project.\n\nClockwork\'s Functionality and Open-Source Code\n\nClockwork\'s Role and Openness\n\nClockwork served as a protocol that enabled users to schedule transactions on the Solana network and create smart contracts that could automate applications triggered by specific events. Despite the project\'s closure, Garfield emphasized that the code would remain open-source and accessible online. He encouraged others to fork and continue working on the protocol if they wished.\n\nFunding and Future Considerations\n\nSeed Funding and Outcome\n\nLast August, Clockwork successfully raised $4 million in a seed funding round, co-led by venture firms Multicoin Capital and Asymmetric, with participation from Solana Ventures. Addressing inquiries about the fate of the seed money, Garfield indicated that a significant portion of the funds still remains, but he would take time before making a decision about returning the funds to investors.\n\nIn-Line with Recent Trends\n\nSolana Protocol Closures\n\nClockwork\'s closure follows a pattern seen in other Solana protocols. Earlier this year, decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Friktion and Everlend Finance shut down.

The idea [is] that a darling of the last cycle would do very well. I shared this chart of the beginnings of ETH vs. SOL, and I still think SOL probably does more or less the same.

Melloina is known to thrive in diverse ecosystems, including caves.\n\nA male Melloina pacifica ( CREDIT: Echeverri et al. )\n\nEuthycaelus cunampia pays tribute to two Emberá indigenous community members, Don José and Don Antonio, who shifted from hunting traditions to guiding tourists and scholars at the JBP. This discovery marks the first instance of the Euthycaelus genus and the subfamily Schismatothelinae outside specific Colombian regions.\n\nA male Euthycaelus cunampia ( CREDIT: Echeverri et al. )\n\nNeischnocolus mecana is the fourth species and is named after a township in Bahía Solano.\n\nA female Neischnocolus mecana ( CREDIT: Echeverri et al. )\n\nResearchers concluded that the study “serves as a testament to the potential existence of undiscovered species and the need for comprehensive taxonomic research.”\n\nThe study was published in the journal ZooKeys.'}, {'id': 9, 'time': 'Tue, 29 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Solana Price Prediction: SOL Rallies to $20.70 – The New King of DeFi? - Inside Bitcoins', 'content': 'Don’t invest unless prepared to lose all the money you invest.

This change follows after some days of downtrend in the prices of most crypto assets.\n\nAs of 05:26 EST on August 29, Solana trades at $20.32, reflecting a slight increase over the past 24 hours. Earlier today, SOL surged to $20.73 due to the increasing bullish momentum.\n\nThough some altcoins are still red today, Solana has defiled the trend, creating a new direction. Could SOL be the new king of DeFi, and can it sustain the bullish wave?\n\nSOL Could Record Twist in Performance\n\nThe chart shows that SOL trades below the 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), indicating a bearish trend. Also, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence MACD trades below the signal line with red histogram bars signifying bearish activities in the market.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index of 37 suggests that the SOL price is approaching the oversold zone, and a possible trend reversal could follow suit if the price reaches this level.\n\nThe combination of the above indicators points towards a short-term bearish price movement for SOL and an overall long-term market outlook for the asset.\n\nHowever, investors should explore other tools before making a trade decision, as the crypto market is always prone to high price volatility and market fluctuations.\n\nSOL’s Support and Resistance Levels\n\nThe chart above reveals that the SOL/USD pair is under the influence of the bears. So, any further increment in selling pressure could drop SOL’s market value to the $19.21 support.\n\nHowever, if the bulls take control of the SOL/USD market today, they might hold the buying pressure for the next few days, taking the coin’s price to the resistance level of $23.37.\n\nIf the action of the bull forces SOL’s market value above this resistance zone, traders could get excited and accumulate more quantities of the asset. This positive market status may increase the coin’s worth, making SOL hit the next resistance level of $25.54 in the next couple of weeks.\n\nSolana’s Outstanding Partnerships and Developments Could Trigger SOL’s Rally\n\nCollaboration With Shopify\n\nSolana and most protocols built on the Solana blockchain have recently sealed several partnerships with prominent and giant entities.
