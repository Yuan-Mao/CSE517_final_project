His claim was that the US dollar would shortly experience hyperinflation, causing the dollar value of a bitcoin to soar.\n\nQ&A What is bitcoin? Show Bitcoin is a \'cryptocurrency\' – a decentralised tradeable digital asset. Invented in 2008, you store your bitcoins in a digital wallet, and transactions are stored in a public ledger known as the bitcoin blockchain, which prevents the digital currency being double-spent. Cryptocurrencies can be used to send transactions between two parties via the use of private and public keys. These transfers can be done with minimal processing cost, allowing users to avoid the fees charged by traditional financial institutions - as well as the oversight and regulation that entails. The lack of any central authority oversight is one of the attractions. This means it has attracted a range of backers, from libertarian monetarists who enjoy the idea of a currency with no inflation and no central bank, to drug dealers who like the fact that it is hard (but not impossible) to trace a bitcoin transaction back to a physical person. The exchange rate has been volatile, with some deeming it a risky investment. In January 2021 the UK\'s Financial Conduct Authority warned consumers they should be prepared to lose all their money if they invest in schemes promising high returns from digital currencies such as bitcoin. In practice it has been far more important for the dark economy than it has for most legitimate uses. In November 2021 it hit a record high of more than $68,000, as a growing number of investors backed it as an alternative to other assets during the Covid crisis. Bitcoin has been criticised for the vast energy reserves and associated carbon footprint of the system. New bitcoins are created by “mining” coins, which is done by using computers to carry out complex calculations. The more bitcoins that have been "mined", the longer it takes to mine new coin, and the more electricity is used in the process. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.\n\n“This is the moment that the world redenominates on bitcoin as digital gold, returning to a model much like before the 20th century,” he tweeted, explaining the bet. “Everything will happen very fast once people check what I’m saying and see that the Federal Reserve has lied about how much money there is in the banks. All dollar holders get destroyed.”\n\nAlex Adelman, the chief executive of the bitcoin rewards app Lolli, said Monday’s rally “did not have a clear catalyst”, but that it was “a bellwether of bitcoin’s newly bullish market conditions and strong investor confidence. Bitcoin’s ongoing strength suggests that bitcoin is emerging from so-called ‘crypto winter’ into a new phase of strength and renewed interest from retail and institutional investors.”\n\nBut the recovery, after bitcoin prices hovered at $28,000 for almost a month before leaping the final $2,000 in a day, has also led to concern about market manipulation.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we\'ll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The recent surge in Bitcoin prices, with the cryptocurrency surpassing $30,000 for the first time since June, has been attributed to bets on easier monetary policies and renewed investor confidence. Despite Bitcoin's significant gains this year, it remains below its all-time high from November 2021. The market trend suggests a bullish sentiment towards cryptocurrencies, as evidenced by the rapid climb of digital currencies and the rebound of related stocks. However, concerns about market manipulation and regulatory scrutiny, particularly in light of recent banking crises and enforcement actions, may impact the market's stability in the near future.

*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
After reviewing the reports from the on-chain analyst, news analyst, and reflection analyst, it is evident that the current market sentiment for ETH is mixed. The on-chain analyst report indicates a bearish trend with a sell signal on the MACD indicator, suggesting a potential price decline. The news analyst report, on the other hand, highlights a bullish sentiment towards cryptocurrencies in general, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, but also warns of regulatory scrutiny and market manipulation concerns. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of staying informed, adapting to market conditions, and implementing risk management strategies.

Considering the mixed signals from the reports, it is crucial to take a cautious and long-term approach to trading ETH. Short-term gains may be risky given the current market volatility and regulatory uncertainties. It is advisable to focus on long-term strategies that prioritize risk management and capital preservation.

Therefore, my trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.5. This decision reflects a moderate level of caution in response to the bearish signals from the on-chain analyst report and the need to manage risks effectively in the current market environment. By taking a conservative approach and prioritizing long-term strategies, I aim to maximize overall profit and minimize potential losses in the ETH market.

In 2014, for example, the federal government sold off roughly 30,000 BTC from the same source as this latest sale: Silk Road, a darknet marketplace that used bitcoin as its medium of exchange and was shut down in 2013. Zhong managed to steal these funds from Silk Road via wire transfer, as detailed in court documents. In light of his age, cooperation with prosecutors and other extenuating circumstances, he was given a relatively light sentence following the confiscation of his bitcoin.\n\nAlthough the government has certainly sold off larger quantities of bitcoin before, the fact that Zhong’s ill-gotten spoils have blossomed from less than $1 million to nearly $1.5 billion in value has complicated matters. The federal government evidently used Coinbase as the platform to conduct these sales, apparently only offloading the first tranche of the hoard and custodying the remainder. The asking price was roughly $2,000 shy per bitcoin of the retail market asking price that day, and the transaction incurred roughly $215,000 in transaction fees. This fact prompted digs from the crypto community, with many noting that far more generous terms could be found on other exchanges. Still, the sale was successful in a sense, and the federal government plans to sell the rest in four batches.\n\nThe origin of these bitcoin is closely related to a cause célèbre in the international crypto community: the plight of Ross Ulbricht, Silk Road’s founder. Silk Road was one of the first major uses of Bitcoin to make international headlines, representing Bitcoin’s humble origins and the libertarian ideologies at the core of the early crypto community. As a darknet market, the Silk Road offered a venue to connect sellers and buyers of various prohibited substances pseudonymously. After the site was shut down, Ulbricht was arrested, and in 2015 given more than a double life sentence without possibility for parole, despite being a first-time, non-violent offender.\n\nUlbricht has reached out to the Bitcoin community from prison, claiming that he’s “spent the last eight years watching Bitcoin grow up from in here.” Citing the community’s courage and potential for innovation, he has stated that, “We didn’t know how things would turn out for Bitcoin back in the beginning, but over the years, I’ve been continually impressed with what you’ve accomplished.”\n\nAnd indeed, it is incredible how far Bitcoin has come and that comparatively paltry sums while Ulbricht was free have grown to represent billions of dollars in value. However, the extreme harshness of his sentencing is a reminder that institutions of government and finance have been overwhelmingly hostile to Bitcoin in the past, and any acceptance now is itself a massive accomplishment.\n\nIn short, this particular sale, particularly compared to a larger one in 2014, represents the vast growth that Bitcoin has seen since its early days. Despite all of this progress, however, it is important to remember the humble origins of this international community, and all of those who suffered at the cusp of innovation. The events of Silk Road are still relevant to our thriving world of Bitcoin today, and will continue to be for some time to come.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.'}, {'id': 3, 'time': 'Wed, 12 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Bitcoin is one year away from a major technical event. History suggests the start of another bull run - CNBC', 'content': 'In this article BTC.CM= Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nThe bitcoin halving is an event that happens roughly every four years where rewards to miners are cut in halve, effectively limiting supply of the token. S3studio | Getty Images\n\nBitcoin is nearly a year away from a key technical event — which might be the catalyst for a prolonged climb in the cryptocurrency\'s value. In April or May 2024, bitcoin is expected to undergo its next so-called "halving," though the exact date is not yet known. Bitcoin has been rising in the past few weeks in anticipation of the halving, as a potential U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cut contends with the prospect of sluggish growth and tightening credit conditions resulting from woes in the banking sector. One bitcoin was worth roughly $30,000 as of Wednesday morning, according to data from CoinGecko. The world\'s largest cryptocurrency is up by more than 80% since the start of the year. Vijay Ayyar, vice president of corporate development and international at crypto exchange Luno, said that the bitcoin jump above $30,000 at a time of bank failures and economic uncertainty suggests the cyclical "bottom" for bitcoin is forming.\n\nwatch now\n\n"This tends to happen a year or so prior to the Bitcoin\'s halving event, which is slated next for around April 2024," Ayyar told CNBC via email.\n\nWhat is the bitcoin halving?\n\nBitcoin halvings take place roughly every four years, or every time another 210,000 "blocks" are added to the blockchain. The event cuts the rewards to bitcoin miners — volunteers running specialized equipment to validate transactions on the network and mint new tokens — by 50%. The aim is to reduce the number of new bitcoin unit released into the market. Currently, bitcoin miners receive 6.25 bitcoin for each block they successfully mine. This means their computer had the right amount of computing power needed to solve the cryptographic puzzles that secure the bitcoin network and prevent it from being compromised by malicious actors. Once the next bitcoin halving occurs, this reward will be reduced to 3.125 bitcoin.\n\nwatch now\n\nBackers of the cryptocurrency say this can help push up the price by enhancing bitcoin scarcity. The maximum number of bitcoins that will ever exist in circulation is capped at 21 million. This is ensured by the halving mechanism, whereby rewards for mining bitcoin will eventually be slashed to $0. Before the last halving, which took place on May 11, 2020, the price of bitcoin increased by 19% in the preceding 12 months, from $7,191.36 to $8,568.88, according to figures from CCData. During the halving before that — which occurred on Jul. 9, 2016 — bitcoin rallied 142% compared with the 12 months prior, moving from $269.14 to $651.83.\n\nThe first ever halving of Nov. 28, 2012 saw the price of bitcoin balloon by 384% to $12.35 from $2.55, CCData\'s figures show. "Analysing historical Bitcoin halving patterns, it appears that investors often accumulate Bitcoin in the run-up to the halving event, although the exact timing and extent of returns post-halving can differ," Jamie Sly, analyst at CryptoCompare, told CNBC. "The accumulation period from the market bottom after the breakout to the halving date has historically spanned at least 500 days." Sly added: "This would mean, if we were to assume that the market bottom for this cycle was in November last year (when Bitcoin hit a yearly low of $15,760), then we are only 142 days into the current cycle. This would correlate with the next expected Bitcoin halving date, which is another 378 days ahead."\n\nBitcoin\'s post-halving gains\n\nThe bitcoin price tends to spike even higher, in the months that follow halving. After the halving of May 11, 2020, the cryptocurrency rallied 688.31% in the following 546 days, reaching a then record high of $67,549.14 on Nov. 8, 2021, according to CCData.'}, {'id': 15, 'time': 'Wed, 12 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Crypto Bull Rally: Will Bitcoin Cross $100,000 In 2023? - Yahoo Finance', 'content': 'Not everyone has suffered from the recent banking crisis.

But recent market conditions have resulted in investors singing a different tune, touting Bitcoin to be a safe-haven asset and a store of value. While many have heralded Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, the Federal Reserve’s aggressively hawkish stance caused decentralized tokens to fall out of favor last year.\n\nIn the wake of the recent banking crisis, analysts predict the Fed will slow its rate hike trajectory. Bitcoin also has long been considered a store of value. Other popular cryptocurrencies including Ethereum (ETH/USD) and meme token Dogecoin (DOGE/USD) have also fared well. Goldman Sachs stated recently that cryptocurrencies hold a 20% market share as a store of value.\n\nOther blockchain-based assets have been performing strong as well.

The benefits of decentralized tokens have been highlighted in the wake of the recent bank failures, with many proclaiming Bitcoin to be the new digital gold.\n\nStory continues\n\n“I think the rally is explicable by saying people have got freaked out by the banking system by the collapses,” said Oliver Linch, CEO of Bittrex Global.\n\nChangpeng Zhao, co-founder and CEO of Binance, considers Bitcoin to be better than gold.\n\nAs the crypto rally takes off, analysts and institutional investors are betting on Bitcoin to reach its all-time high again this year.\n\n“I think Bitcoin probably breaks all-time highs this year,” said Marshall Beard, chief strategy officer of cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, adding that the cryptocurrency could hit the $100,000 mark.\n\nSee Also: The House-Printing Robot Shaking Up a $7.28 Trillion Industry\n\nVijay Ayyar, head of international at crypto exchange Luno, said, “Broadly, we are looking quite bullish here with Bitcoin reclaiming $28K and looking to target $30K next.”\n\nOn March 17, Balaji Srinivasan, former technology chief at crypto exchange Coinbase, bet $2 million that Bitcoin could cross $1 million in just 90 days, as hyperinflation kicks in. Notably, Bitcoin would have to surge by nearly 3,500% within the next three months to reach this mark.\n\nThe blockchain-based gaming market is expected to benefit from the crypto rally to hit a $50 billion valuation by 2025. This marks a 33 times rise from the $1.5 billion market size reported in 2021.\n\nFed Scaling Back And Future Of Crypto\n\nThe Fed’s dovish stance is expected to fuel the bullish case for crypto, as decentralized currencies regain momentum. Typically Bitcoin has outperformed other major asset classes in a bull market.\n\n"Any time that you\'ve held Bitcoin in a four-year rolling interval, so you pick the day, hold it for four years, you\'ve outperformed every other asset class," stated SkyBridge Capital Founder and Managing Partner Anthony Scaramucci.\n\nBut the disappointing jobs report and weak economic data published earlier this week has steered investors to reliable asset classes, including gold.

The news articles suggest a positive outlook for the cryptocurrency market, particularly for Bitcoin. The increase in Bitcoin hoarding in personal wallets, the resurgence of Bitcoin leading to the push for leveraged ETFs, the upcoming halving event in 2024, and the bullish sentiment towards Bitcoin reaching $100,000 indicate a potential upward trend in the market. Additionally, the recognition of Bitcoin as a safe-haven asset and store of value amidst economic uncertainty and banking crises further supports the positive market sentiment.

REASONING:
After reviewing the reports from the on-chain analyst, news analyst, and reflection analyst, it is evident that the current market sentiment for ETH is mixed. The on-chain analyst report indicates a bearish trend with a sell signal on the MACD indicator, suggesting a potential price decline. The news analyst report, on the other hand, highlights a bullish sentiment towards cryptocurrencies in general, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, but also warns of regulatory scrutiny and market manipulation concerns. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of staying informed, adapting to market conditions, and implementing risk management strategies.

Considering the mixed signals from the reports, it is crucial to take a cautious and long-term approach to trading ETH. Short-term gains may be risky given the current market volatility and regulatory uncertainties. It is advisable to focus on long-term strategies that prioritize risk management and capital preservation.

Therefore, my trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.5. This decision reflects a moderate level of caution in response to the bearish signals from the on-chain analyst report and the need to manage risks effectively in the current market environment.

After reviewing the on-chain, news, and reflection analyst reports, it is clear that there are mixed signals in the market.

After initially announcing its closure, the marketplace was temporarily rescued by an anonymous donor—but it ultimately wasn\'t enough to keep OpenBazaar open for business.\n\nOpenBazaar CEO Brian Hoffman confirmed in a message to Decrypt that he is rebuilding the marketplace, though he declined to add any further detail.

It was known for its unique approach to online shopping, providing a decentralized marketplace where users could buy and sell goods without the need for a central authority, like, say, Amazon or Etsy. The idea was to give users more freedom over the goods they sold.\n\nThe plan worked for a while before OpenBazaar\'s funding issues. Merchants set up hundreds of shops, accepting cryptocurrencies for their goods.\n\nAccording to Hoffman\'s GitHub account (a site where developers post their code publicly for others to use), he has been working on a new implementation of OpenBazaar in the programming language Rust, which is all the rage in Bitcoin lately.\n\nBitcoin Privacy Tool Aims to \'Confuse\' Surveillance Companies\n\nOn Twitter, some users are already excited about OpenBazaar’s return.\n\nIn an interview with CoinDesk in 2018, OpenBazaar co-founder Washington Sanchez described OpenBazaar\'s purpose as such: "OpenBazaar is supposed to be a free and open protocol for trade using cryptocurrency, a way for currencies and tokens to gain meaningful economic utility to acquire goods and service, and an entry point for people to earn and onboard."\n\nFollowing the OpenBazaar\'s shutdown in 2020, its founders hinted that structural changes would be needed to further place control of the marketplace in the hands of its community and away from the company that initially created it.'}, {'id': 51, 'time': 'Thu, 13 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Crypto Price Today Live: Bitcoin holds above $30k; Solana, Ethereum rise up to 5% - The Economic Times', 'content': '\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost of the cryptocurrencies were trading higher on Thursday amid better-than-expected US economic data.

Because obviously, we\'re seeing at least today, Ethereum off to the races here versus Bitcoin. I mean, up about almost 6% on the day. What are your takeaways from that? Obviously, a lot of excitement surrounding this.\n\nSCOTT MELKER: Yeah, there was a bit of a nonsensical narrative that everybody who had staked their Ethereum for the past few years was going to try to withdraw all at once, which you couldn\'t do anyways, and sell all their Ethereum. But you have to remember that anyone who staked their 30 to Ethereum, which by the way, for most people, was over $60,000. But anyone who staked that 30 to Ethereum had no guarantee they would even be able to withdraw.\n\nThese are the people who are the biggest believers, the maximalists of Ethereum, who really wanted to help secure the network. So now that they\'re getting the opportunity to withdraw, they\'re going to continue staking. I think there were more people. And I can speak to this anecdotally from fund managers that I speak to in institutions.\n\nThere are a lot more people who are actually waiting to deposit because they would then know that they would be able to withdraw at some point. So we\'re actually seeing net inflows over the past 24 hours. It\'s going back and forth. But there has not been a huge demand for people to withdraw. And there are just as many people putting their money into the contract. I think that this is a huge development for Ethereum. Yet another major step in the right direction for the protocol.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: And do you think perhaps investors are more bullish on Ethereum given the use cases versus Bitcoin?\n\nSCOTT MELKER: I view them as completely separate assets. I think that the flipping narrative is completely irrelevant. I view Bitcoin as a digital gold, store of value, flight to safety. And we\'ve obviously seen that, especially, with the banking collapses a few months ago, and Bitcoin rise a few weeks ago. With Bitcoin rising from roughly 19,000 to over $30,000, Ethereum is more of a technological investment. It\'s a internet of value. And I think that we\'re starting to see that separation in people\'s minds. So I think you can love one, love both, and it\'s totally fine. You don\'t have to really choose.

Rodgers missed an NFL game in the 2021 season after testing positive for COVID-19.\n\nThe Packers quarterback said he underwent alternative treatment because of being allergic to an ingredient in the vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna.\n\nWhile it shouldn’t come as a huge surprise that Rodgers is backing a fellow anti-vax candidate, Kennedy Jr. and the quarterback may differ on opinions on another topic, the world of cryptocurrency.\n\nKennedy Jr. has been vocal as a candidate against central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).\n\n“CBDCs grease the slippery slope to financial slavery and political tyranny,” Kennedy Jr. said. “A CBDC tied to digital ID and social credit score will allow the government to freeze your assets or limit your spending to approved vendors if you fail to comply with arbitrary diktats, i.e. vaccine mandates.”\n\nWhile Kennedy Jr. is speaking out against CBDCs, he could show future support for Bitcoin with additional comments.\n\n“Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin give the public an escape route from the splatter zone when this [financial] bubble invariably bursts,” Kennedy Jr said.\n\nRodgers has been a proponent of Bitcoin BTC/USD and cryptocurrency over the years. In 2021, the quarterback announced a partnership with CashApp, a unit of Block Inc SQ.\n\n“I’m pumped to share that I’ve recently teamed with CashApp, they’ve enabled me to take part of my salary in Bitcoin for the very first time,” Rodgers said in a video.\n\nRodgers also offered fans the chance to win $1 million in Bitcoin through the partnership.\n\n“I believe in Bitcoin & the future is bright.”\n\nRodgers was also featured at the Bitcoin 2022 Conference where he encouraged college athletes who have NIL and scholarship money to invest a portion into cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.\n\n“The Fed keeps printing trillions of dollars, you know, the best defense against inflation, I believe is Bitcoin, and they will keep printing money.”\n\nRead Next: Trump Gains Against DeSantis In New Poll After Indictment, Here's How He Matcches Up Against Biden For 2024 Election\n\nPhotos: Shutterstock"}]

DAILY RETURN:

REASONING:
After reviewing the reports from the on-chain analyst, news analyst, and reflection analyst, it is evident that the current market sentiment for ETH is mixed. The on-chain analyst report indicates a bearish trend with a sell signal on the MACD indicator, suggesting a potential price decline. The news analyst report, on the other hand, highlights a bullish sentiment towards cryptocurrencies in general, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, but also warns of regulatory scrutiny and market manipulation concerns. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of staying informed, adapting to market conditions, and implementing risk management strategies.

Considering the mixed signals from the reports, it is crucial to take a cautious and long-term approach to trading ETH. Short-term gains may be risky given the current market volatility and regulatory uncertainties. It is advisable to focus on long-term strategies that prioritize risk management and capital preservation.

Therefore, my trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.5. This decision reflects a moderate level of caution in response to the bearish signals from the on-chain analyst report and the need to manage risks effectively in the current market environment. By taking a conservative approach and prioritizing long-term strategies, I aim to maximize overall profit and minimize potential losses in the ETH market.

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain, news, and reflection analyst reports, it is clear that there are mixed signals in the market. The on-chain data indicates increased activity in the ETH network, but the MACD signal remains at sell, suggesting a bearish trend. The news analyst report, on the other hand, highlights positive sentiment in the overall cryptocurrency market, particularly for Bitcoin. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of a cautious and long-term approach to trading in the current market conditions.

Considering these factors, it is prudent to take a conservative approach and prioritize risk management strategies. While there may be potential opportunities for growth in the cryptocurrency market, it is essential to navigate the uncertainties and volatility with a long-term perspective.

Therefore, I would recommend a cautious trading action with a slight bias towards selling ETH in the short term. My trading action would be -0.3, reflecting a moderate level of confidence in the bearish trend indicated by the MACD signal and the need to manage risks effectively in the current market environment.

He spoke during a recent episode of the "We Study Billionaires" podcast.\n\nHere are Marks\' 8 best quotes from the interview, lightly edited for length and clarity:\n\n1. "The declining interest rates were responsible for the majority of all the money that\'s been made in the last 45 years." (Marks hailed the Federal Reserve\'s embrace of lower rates as a "sea change" for financial markets, as it made borrowing cheaper and debt financing easier.)\n\n2. "The rates are high today to fight inflation. I don\'t think they\'re going to stay this high. But they\'re through coming down in any major way, and they\'re through being ultra-low."\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. "I just think it\'s too good to be true to think we can have a credit card we never have to pay the balance on." (Marks was warning that continued growth in the US federal debt will likely have serious consequences down the line.)\n\n4. "AI, just like passive investing and machine learning — even maybe to a greater extent — will knock out everybody who doesn\'t add value. It should be harder and harder and harder to run money and be paid highly for producing inferior. But hopefully there will still be a small group of people who can do something that the machine can\'t do."\n\n5. "Can an AI-enabled computer sit down with CEOs and figure out which one is Steve Jobs? Can it sit down with five business plans and figure out which one is Amazon? I just don\'t think so. This is an art form."\n\n6. "There are people who believe that when you have a bank crisis, like we did with Silicon Valley Bank and some of the others, that the weakness of the banks shows the strength of bitcoin. It\'s in many ways an anti-bank play. It does seem that there are good uses for some coins, and bitcoin seems to be the one in the lead so far."\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. "Humility is a really important thing, especially in the market, which humbles us all. Anybody who doesn\'t allow for humility, in a field where there\'s randomness and uncertainty, and qualitative and subjective things are important, is riding for a fall."\n\n8. "People used to talk about the factory of the future, which would have one man and one dog, and it was the dog\'s job to keep the man from touching the equipment. It was the man\'s job to feed the dog. I would like to have the Fed keep its hands off the machinery most of the time."'}, {'id': 9, 'time': 'Sat, 15 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Michael Saylor Buys Another $150 Million in Bitcoin: Is the Crypto a Screaming Buy? - The Motley Fool', 'content': "The crypto markets had a rough 2022, and Bitcoin (BTC 0.02%) wasn't spared -- the cryptocurrency fell nearly 65% last year. But 2023 has become a comeback story, with Bitcoin up 83% since January.\n\nBitcoin mega-supporter and MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor recently revealed that his company bought 6,455 Bitcoin in late March, a transaction worth $150 million.\n\nShould investors follow Saylor's lead? One shouldn't base their investment decisions on someone else's, but there are some excellent reasons to consider adding Bitcoin to your portfolio today. Here is what you need to know.\n\nA hefty vote of confidence\n\nAlthough investors should make their own decisions, there's no denying the influence that well-known investors such as Warren Buffett can have on a stock's sentiment. Saylor is arguably the Buffett equivalent to Bitcoin investors, and his latest $150 million investment is a vote of confidence if anything.\n\nMicroStrategy now owns 138,955 total Bitcoin worth almost $4.2 billion. The company's average Bitcoin cost is $29,817, just a bit below where it trades today. In other words, you could argue that Saylor sees value in Bitcoin at its current price; a $4 billion investment would imply an expectation that the asset's value will increase over time.\n\nHowever, one shouldn't automatically mirror Saylor's sentiment on Bitcoin, just as one shouldn't blindly buy Coca-Cola stock just because Buffett owns it. Instead, look at it as a prompt to revisit your investment thesis.\n\nRevisiting Bitcoin's investment case\n\nThe overarching theme for Bitcoin is that it's a store of value, similar to gold or silver. Ideally, Bitcoin can protect investors from two critical problems of the fiat-based financial system. First, Bitcoin has a limited supply of 21 million coins, a hedge against inflation that continually devalues fiat currency as more is created. Second, it's decentralized, independent of central control like the U.S. financial system, which is dominated by the Federal Reserve.\n\nAdditionally, banks use a fractional reserve system, where they leverage their deposits to lend more money than they have. That's fine until too many people try to pull their money out of the banks at once. Bitcoin's scarcity and independence from any person or party controlling it have driven demand and fantastic investment returns. Bitcoin has easily outpaced the S&P 500 despite the coin's dramatic decline in 2022.\n\nSome might ask whether Bitcoin's volatility disqualifies it as a store of value, but Bitcoin doesn't seem any more volatile than silver and gold. You can see below that gold and silver have experienced similar declines from their highs, a reminder that asset prices fluctuate.\n\nYes, Bitcoin has been more volatile than gold, but it's a less-known commodity than a precious metal that has been sought after and valued for thousands of years. Perhaps Bitcoin will become less volatile as it ages -- it's a fair question, at the least.\n\nIs Bitcoin's comeback just beginning?\n\nFor now, markets seem to value Bitcoin as a riskier asset, which declines when investors flee to safety. Gold is near its all-time high, while Bitcoin is far from it. Bitcoin's early 2023 comeback could signal that the crypto winter, as some call it, is nearing its end.\n\nInvestors will only know for sure in hindsight, but it appears Bitcoin's long-term appeal is still intact, especially after the near-miss of another crisis in the modern banking system. Bitcoin will likely remain a volatile asset, but it could have more up days than down if the market's sentiment toward riskier assets turns positive."}, {'id': 15, 'time': 'Sat, 15 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Healthy Bitcoin rally: What does a margin lending ratio drop mean for BTC price? - Cointelegraph', 'content': 'Bitcoin (BTC) price rallied over 10% between April 9 and April 14, marking the highest daily close in over 10 months. While some analysts may argue the move justifies a degree of decoupling from traditional markets, both the S&P 500 and gold are near their highest levels in over six months.\n\nBitcoin price breaks $30,000 despite macro headwinds\n\nBitcoin’s gains and rally above $30,000 also happened while the U.S. Dollar Index (DYX), which measures the currency against a basket of foreign exchanges, reached its lowest level in 12 months.\n\nThe indicator fell to 100.8 on April 14 from 104.7 one month prior as investors priced in higher odds of further liquidity injections by the United States Federal Reserve.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin price teases $30K breakdown ahead of US CPI, FOMC minutes\n\nThe latest Federal Reserve’s monetary policy meeting minutes, released on April 12, made explicit reference to the anticipation of a “mild recession” later in 2023 due to the banking crisis. Even if inflation is no longer a primary concern, the monetary authority has little room to raise interest rates further without escalating an economic crisis.\n\nEven if inflation is no longer a primary concern, the monetary authority has little room to raise interest rates further without escalating an economic crisis.\n\nStrong macroeconomic data explains investors’ bullishness\n\nWhile the global economy may deteriorate in the coming months, recent macroeconomic data has been mostly positive. For example, the European Union’s statistics office reported that industrial production in the 20 member countries increased 1.5% month on month in February, whereas economists polled by Reuters expected a 1% increase.\n\nFurthermore, China’s latest macroeconomic data showed an encouraging trend, with exports increasing 14.8% year on year in March, snapping a five-month decline and surprising economists who expected a 7% decline. As a result, China’s trade balance for March was $89.2 billion, far exceeding the $39.2 billion market consensus.\n\nThe contrast between the current economic momentum and the forthcoming recession triggered by higher financing costs and a reduced appetite for risk among lenders causes Bitcoin investors to question the sustainability of the $30,000 support.\n\nLet’s look at Bitcoin derivatives metrics to better understand how professional traders are positioned in the current market environment.\n\nBTC derivatives show no excessive leverage from longs\n\nMargin markets provide insight into how professional traders are positioned because they allow investors to borrow cryptocurrency to leverage their positions.\n\nOKX, for instance, provides a margin lending indicator based on the stablecoin/BTC ratio. Traders can increase exposure by borrowing stablecoins to buy Bitcoin. On the other hand, Bitcoin borrowers can only bet on the decline of a cryptocurrency’s price.\n\nOKX stablecoin/BTC margin lending ratio. Source: OKX\n\nThe above chart shows that OKX traders’ margin lending ratio decreased between April 9 and April 11. That is extremely healthy as it shows no leverage has been used to support Bitcoin’s price gains, at least not using margin markets. Moreover, given the general bullishness of crypto traders, the current margin lending ratio of 15 is relatively neutral.\n\nThe long-to-short metric excludes externalities that might have solely impacted the margin markets. In addition, it gathers data from exchange clients’ positions on the spot, perpetual and quarterly futures contracts, thus offering better information on how professional traders are positioned.\n\nThere are occasional methodological discrepancies between different exchanges, so readers should monitor changes instead of absolute figures.\n\nExchanges’ top traders Bitcoin long-to-short ratio. Source: Coinglass\n\nInterestingly, despite Bitcoin breaking $30,000 for the first time in 10 months, pro traders have kept their leverage long positions unchanged, according to the long-to-short indicator.\n\nFor instance, the ratio for Huobi traders stood firm near 0.98 from April 9 until April 14. Meanwhile, at crypto exchange Binance, the long-to-short slightly increased, favoring longs, moving from 1.12 on April 9 to the current 1.14. Lastly, at crypto exchange OKX, the long-to-short ratio slightly declined, from 1.00 on April 9 to the current 0.91.\n\nRelated: Tesla selling Bitcoin last year turned out to be a $500M mistake\n\nMoreover, Bitcoin futures traders were not confident enough to add leveraged bullish positions. Thus, even if Bitcoin’s price retests $29,000 in terms of derivatives, bulls should be unconcerned because there has been little demand from short-sellers and no excessive leverage from buyers.\n\nIn other words, Bitcoin’s market structure is bullish, where BTC’s price can quickly rally another 10% to $33,000, given sellers are currently reluctant to short it.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors’ alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and...'}, {'id': 30, 'time': 'Sat, 15 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'What is Mining in Crypto? - DailyCoin', 'content': '15 years after the Bitcoin (BTC) white paper was published, ‘What is mining in cryptocurrency?’ is still the question on the tip of everyone’s tongue. The birth of blockchain technology and the crypto market began with Bitcoin mining.\n\nInitially, Bitcoin miners could mine new coins with a laptop in their bedrooms. Today, professional mining operations are worth millions, with ASIC mining farms burning through a huge amount of energy to earn new Bitcoin payouts.\n\nCrypto mining isn’t only about earning digital currency through block rewards; it also helps secure the blockchain network.\n\nDespite crypto mining being an iconic industry staple, the mining process remains complicated and inaccessible to most people. In this article, we’ll break down cryptocurrency mining for beginners and unpack how it works.\n\nWhat Is Cryptocurrency Mining?\n\nCryptocurrency mining is the process by which new blocks are added to a blockchain and new coins are ‘minted’, or created. In the case of the Bitcoin network, miners receive new bitcoins in exchange for validating transactions on a decentralized public ledger.\n\nCrypto mining is a competitive game. Miners want to accumulate as many bitcoins as possible, so having large mining rigs with powerful mining hardware gives them a better chance of earning the right to create new blocks.\n\nSource: Bloomberg\n\nWhen you have thousands of individual miners and mining farms trying to create new blocks for a distributed ledger like the Bitcoin blockchain, there needs to be an algorithm that decides who ‘wins.’ We call this the Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism.\n\nWhat Is Proof-of-Work?\n\nIn a Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism, Bitcoin miners compete to create new blocks and earn mining rewards. In its simplest definition, powerful computers work to solve complex mathematical problems and validate Bitcoin transactions. The first miner to find the answer creates the new block and earns their mining rewards.\n\nDiving a bit deeper, every new block generates a target hash. The target hash is a 64-digit hexadecimal number. These digits are made up of not only numbers from 1-10 but also letters A-F. The first miner to guess a number lower or equal to the target hash gets to create the next block and earn the reward.\n\nSource: Union Journal\n\nWith trillions of possible solutions, the odds of guessing these numbers are extremely difficult. Miners with powerful mining equipment can make more ‘guesses’ faster, giving them a better chance of being the first to find the number.\n\nWhile Bitcoin is the classic example of a Proof-of-Work chain in action, there are plenty of other examples. These include altcoins like Dogecoin (DOGE), Litecoin (LTC), and pre-merge Ethereum (ETH).\n\nBefore taking a closer look at the specifics of crypto mining, let’s have a quick recap:\n\nCryptocurrency mining creates new blocks for a blockchain network and mints new coins to the circulating supply.\n\nMiners compete amongst themselves to solve complex equations, verify new transactions and earn mining rewards.\n\nHigher computing power increases the chance of being the first miner to solve an equation.\n\nHow Does Bitcoin Mining Work?\n\nWhen Satoshi Nakamoto first published the Bitcoin white paper, bitcoin mining was far more democratized than now. Anyone with a computer could start mining at home with a half-decent GPU (Graphics Processing Unit).\n\nBitcoin mining has since become a serious business, with ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) mining farms reaching explosive hash rates and boosting mining difficulty.\n\nIndividual miners struggle to compete with the larger players. To compete in the crypto mining monopoly, smaller miners often join forces to create mining pools, where each miner gets their fair share of new coins.\n\nMining Difficulty\n\nAs the name would suggest, mining difficulty refers to the complexity of the problem each miner is trying to solve. Remember the hexadecimal number that every miner tries to find that we mentioned earlier? The more miners competing to create new blocks, the more possible solutions there are that miners have to guess correctly.\n\nWhen mining difficulty is high, that generally means that market conditions are bullish for Bitcoin or whichever PoW cryptocurrency is being mined. Another way of looking at crypto mining demand is a network’s hash rate.\n\nHash Rate\n\nA blockchain’s hash rate is an indicator of its computational power. Put simply, a network’s hash rate measures how many guesses all miners in the system make per second. To give you an idea, in Q1 2023, Bitcoin averaged a hash rate of roughly 310 million terahashes per second.\n\nSource: BitInfoCharts\n\nA hash rate can also refer to the computational power of individual mining units or groups of miners. Powerful ASIC miners with high hash rates have a better of solving the mining puzzle first, making them far more desirable than smaller CPUs.\n\nWhat Is the Bitcoin Halving?\n\nThe Bitcoin halving is an event that happens every 210,000 blocks, ...'}]

Ether rose 13.16% in the same period to US$2,100.\n\nIt’s been an eventful week for crypto and the global economy.\n\nBitcoin broke US$30,000 for the first time since June 2022, days after the blockchain surpassed 1 million Ordinals inscriptions, generating over US$4.8 million in fees for the network. Ordinals are likened to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Bitcoin and allow users to mint images, videos, text and even video games.\n\nInvestor sentiment ticked up after Ethereum completed the Shanghai upgrade on Wednesday, enabling staking withdrawals for the first time. Ether broke through the US$2,000 ceiling for the first time since August last year, snuffing out initial concerns that Ether withdrawals would add selling pressure on the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nEven if Ether are unstaked, it does not necessarily mean that people are going to sell, because they could also use it for other DeFi investments, Chen Zhuling, co-founder and CEO of crypto staking platform RockX, said in an interview on Thursday.\n\nOn economy readings, the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) released on Wednesday showed a cooler-than-expected inflation gain of 5% in March on year, the smallest increase since May 2021.\n\nThe U.S. consumer price index released on Wednesday showed cooler-than-expected numbers and the smallest increase since May 2021. Image: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. equities rallied Thursday on softer readings in the U.S. producer price index and jobless claims, adding to optimism the Federal Reserve could soon end its year-long cycle of raising interest rates to curb inflation.\n\nThe seeming slowdown in inflation could encourage investors and hedge funds to buy Bitcoin, said Marat Minkin, co-founder of decentralized finance payment app TONBanking.\n\nLower inflation usually encourages investors to take a more aggressive risk stance for assets like Bitcoin, said Minkin in emailed comments.\n\nU.S. Federal Reserve. Image: Getty Images\n\nJohn Isige, an analyst at crypto trading platform Vauld, said that Bitcoin’s gains this year show it is maturing as an asset class and that it offers a hedge against economic uncertainty.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Bitcoin is definitely at the start of a bull run. Volumes are still low but holding US$30,000 could keep small retail traders streaming into the market,” Isige said in a LinkedIn response to Forkast. The latest CPI data shows inflation is easing in the U.S. and that is encouraging, he said.\n\nHowever, Brian Santos, the founder of the non-profit Bitcoin Business Alliance said the token remains in bearish territory and he expects a price correction if Bitcoin does not break out well above US$30,000.\n\nKadan Stadelmann, chief technical officer of blockchain infrastructure development firm Komodo, agreed that Bitcoin could still be in a bear market due to thin volume.\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nThe global crypto market capitalization stood at US$1.28 trillion on Friday at 9:15 p.m. in Hong Kong, up from US$1.18 trillion a week ago, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin’s US$594 billion market cap accounted for 46.4% of the market, while Ether’s US$252 billion accounted for 19.7%.\n\nSee related article: Crypto firms hardpressed to find U.S. bank partners as industry blames ‘Operation Choke Point 2.0’\n\nBiggest gainers: RNDR and WOO\n\nThe Render Network’s token (RNDR) was this week’s biggest gainer among the top 100 coins by market capitalization listed on CoinMarketCap, rallying 24.83% to US$1.61. The token started gaining momentum on April 9, three days after the network announced the community approval of its migration to Solana.\n\nThe Render Network allows idle GPUs (graphics processing units) to be used for the digital rendering needed in fields like 3D modeling, gaming imagery, and virtual reality.\n\nThe WOO coin, the utility token of crypto trading platform Woo Network, was this week’s second biggest gainer with a rise of 23.14% to trade at US$0.25. The token started its rally on April 10, days after crypto exchange Kraken announced the launch of WOO perpetual contracts.\n\nNext week: Market eyes US$32,000 Bitcoin price\n\n“All eyes are on US$32,000, a resistance that may determine the beginning of a bull run. A break above this brings US$38,000 within a reachable scope,” wrote Isige.\n\nBut Ikrom Ergashev, co-founder of blockchain investment analytics firm Neironix, expects Bitcoin to move sideways next week at US$29,000-32,000, he said in emailed comments.\n\nSee related article: Ethereum stands firm as Shapella upgrade rolls out'}, {'id': 37, 'time': 'Sun, 16 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Bitcoin News: BTC sees bullish trends as experts believe Shiba Inu (SHIB) and RenQ Finance (RENQ) are ready for a ... - Analytics Insight', 'content': 'Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has been seeing bullish trends in recent months. However, experts believe that other cryptocurrencies, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and RenQ Finance (RENQ), may be ready for a surge in 2023. In this article, we will explore why experts are bullish on SHIB and RENQ and what factors may contribute to their potential growth.\n\nBTC sees bullish trends\n\nBitcoin’s recent surge to a nine-month high is a positive indication that the medium-term bearish trend in the cryptocurrency market is starting to shift. While the daily charts show a bullish trend, there may still be some short-term consolidation to consider.\n\nDuring Q1 of 2023, BTC/USD surpassed the 200-day moving average, the 89-day moving average, and the lower edge of the Ichimoku cloud on the daily charts, signaling the start of an uptrend. The downward correction in March was halted at the 200-day moving average, further supporting the emerging uptrend.\n\nAs of the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at approximately $30,400, after peaking at a 10-month high of $30,540 last week.\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) and RenQ Finance (RENQ) Overview\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) is a meme-inspired cryptocurrency that was launched in August 2020. It was created as a decentralized alternative to other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. SHIB has gained popularity due to its low value, which allows investors to buy large quantities of the cryptocurrency at a relatively low price.\n\nRenQ Finance (RENQ), on the other hand, is a DeFi token that aims to solve the liquidity problem faced by decentralized exchanges. It offers a comprehensive solution that is accessible to all types of traders, from novices to seasoned professionals. Its innovative features, strong community support, and potential for growth make it an attractive option for investors looking to get involved in the DeFi space.\n\nBullish Trends for SHIB and RENQ:\n\nExperts believe that both SHIB and RENQ are poised for a surge in 2023. Here are some of the reasons why:\n\nGrowing Popularity : SHIB has been gaining popularity in the crypto community due to its low value and meme-inspired nature. It has also been listed on major cryptocurrency exchanges, which has increased its exposure and legitimacy in the market. RENQ has also been gaining popularity due to its innovative features and potential to solve the liquidity problem faced by decentralized exchanges.\n\n: SHIB has been gaining popularity in the crypto community due to its low value and meme-inspired nature.

The Stacks crypto project is here to extend the Bitcoin blockchain beyond its limitations, bringing improved functionality to the world’s largest cryptocurrency network.\n\nOne of the biggest concerns about Bitcoin (BTC) is its lack of utility outside of being a self-custodial digital asset payment network. The Stacks blockchain liberates Bitcoin from these limitations, building DeFi apps and NFTs on top of Bitcoin’s impenetrable security.\n\nWhat is Stacks (STX)? How does this innovative Bitcoin layer work behind the scenes? Is it truly a threat to other smart contract-capable networks like Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA)?\n\nWhat Is Stacks (STX)?\n\nStacks is a Layer-1 blockchain capable of supporting smart contracts. It aims to unlock the full potential of Bitcoin by providing an ecosystem of dApps and products that are settled on the world’s most secure and decentralized blockchain.\n\nNot only does the Stacks network bring greater utility to Bitcoin, but it also seeks to resolve its scalability issues with higher transaction throughput. Could Stacks be the ultimate solution to Vitalik Buterin’s symbolic blockchain trilemma?\n\nWhy Does Bitcoin Need Stacks?\n\nDespite Bitcoin’s position as the world’s top cryptocurrency, it’s often criticized as being nothing more than a decentralized store of value. As a payment network, many alternative blockchains like XRP are faster and more affordable.\n\nOn top of that, the Bitcoin blockchain doesn’t support smart contracts, making it infinitely less useful than a network like Ethereum that hosts a multitude of DeFi apps. Apart from sending and receiving BTC between wallets, there’s not much you can do with Bitcoin.\n\nAs a digital asset, BTC represents over $500 billion of liquidity but offers no way to leverage this value creatively. For example, there are no decentralized exchanges or lending platforms on Bitcoin.\n\nStacks solves this problem and brings integral blockchain functions, like decentralized finance and NFT technology, to the Bitcoin network.\n\nHow Does Stacks Work?\n\nThe Stacks network is an execution layer that settles complex transactions using the Bitcoin blockchain as a base layer.\n\nAt the core of this process are two unique features of the Stacks protocol. These are the Proof-of-Transfer (PoX) consensus algorithm and the Clarity programming language.\n\nProof-of-Transfer (PoX)\n\nThe Proof-of-Transfer consensus mechanism is the key link between Stacks and Bitcoin. It’s an extension of the Proof-of-Burn algorithm, wherein miners burn crypto as a proxy in exchange for computing resources to secure the chain.\n\nInstead of burning tokens in exchange for computing resources, tokens are committed to the Stacks protocol and transferred between network participants. We call these Miners and Stackers.\n\nSource: Stacks\n\nMiners transfer BTC to Stackers, hoping to win block rewards and transaction fees from the Stacks network. The chances of winning the block correspond to the amount of BTC committed.\n\nOn the hand, Stackers lock their STX tokens to the network in exchange for BTC committed to the network by Miners. After their lock-up period is complete, Stackers reclaim their STX tokens.\n\nClarity\n\nClarity is a smart contract programming language unique to the Stacks network. It’s optimized for predictability and security and was specifically designed to combat common exploits seen in Solidity, Ethereum’s dominant language.\n\nHere are some of the key features of the Clarity programming language:\n\nUncompiled – Clarity contracts are committed to the network exactly as they are written. In many other languages, contracts are compiled into byte-code before being submitted to the chain. This leaves room for the contract’s missing aspects in translation, potentially opening the door to vulnerabilities.\n\n– Clarity contracts are committed to the network exactly as they are written. In many other languages, contracts are compiled into byte-code before being submitted to the chain. This leaves room for the contract’s missing aspects in translation, potentially opening the door to vulnerabilities. Decidability – When writing Clarity contracts, developers can guarantee that program execution will terminate after a finite number of steps. This also makes it easier to ascertain transaction costs, meaning you’ll never need to worry about running out of gas halfway through a transaction.\n\n– When writing Clarity contracts, developers can guarantee that program execution will terminate after a finite number of steps.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the market trend for ETH is currently bearish, with indications of potential price declines in the near term. The fluctuating open price, high transaction fees, and sell trend suggested by the MACD signal all point towards a cautious approach to trading.

On the other hand, the news analyst report presents a more positive sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin and Ethereum showing strength and growing interest in cryptocurrency adoption. The support from influential figures and the return of platforms like OpenBazaar indicate a bullish trend in the market.

Considering the reflection analyst report, which emphasizes a cautious and conservative approach based on thorough analysis and risk management, it is evident that a long-term strategy is crucial in navigating the current market uncertainties and volatility. While short-term gains may be tempting, prioritizing risk management and staying informed about market conditions is key to consistent success in cryptocurrency trading.

Therefore, based on the synthesized reports, the recommended market trend is to adopt a conservative approach with a slight bias towards selling ETH in the short term to mitigate risks effectively. This approach aligns with the cautious outlook presented in the on-chain analyst report and the emphasis on long-term strategies highlighted in the reflection analyst report.

As a result, my trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.3, reflecting a moderate level of certainty in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately. By prioritizing risk management and long-term strategies, I aim to maximize overall profit and navigate the current market conditions successfully.

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a cautious and conservative approach, prioritizing long-term strategies and risk management, has been effective in maximizing profit.

Considering the overall sentiment and market trends, it is advisable to focus on long-term strategies over short-term gains.

The ETH cryptocurrency market has been experiencing a downward trend recently, with the open price decreasing from 30,231.58 to 29,449.09. The average transaction fees have been fluctuating but remain relatively low, indicating a stable network usage. The total size used and total value transferred have also been varying, suggesting some volatility in trading activity. The MACD signal has consistently been indicating a sell trend, except for the most recent data point where it switched to a buy signal. This could potentially signal a short-term reversal in the market trend, but further monitoring is needed to confirm a sustained upward movement. Overall, the market appears to be bearish with some potential for a temporary bullish reversal.

Meanwhile, ether was lower by 2.4% but maintained the $2,000 it broke through last week.\n\nCrypto is coming off a winning week in which prices were boosted by optimism around Ethereum\'s latest tech upgrade, dubbed "Shapella" (also known as "Shanghai"). The update is meant to bring greater liquidity to the network by allowing "locked up" ether to be withdrawn and ultimately draw in more institutional interest in the long term. Bitcoin and ether advanced 8% and 12%, respectively, for the week.\n\nThis week, it wouldn\'t be surprising to see a small correction in prices, according to Yuya Hasegawa, crypto market analyst at Japanese bitcoin exchange Bitbank, and there could be some selling pressure as some investors may want to take profits from the previous week.\n\nWhile crypto was rallying, "Friday\'s U.S. stock market showed unstable movements as stronger-than-expected consumer sentiment and Fed\'s Waller\'s speech strengthened the possibility of another rate hike in May," Hasegawa said. "Nevertheless, the Fed Funds futures market has already priced in more than 80% chance of a 25bp hike in May, so pressures from macro factors on the price of bitcoin is expected to be limited."\n\nCrypto investors are watching bank earnings this week for more insight about the health of the sector and possibility of a coming recession. Several Fed officials are scheduled to speak this week too.\n\n"We haven\'t seen crypto perform in a high-rate, slowing growth environment until now," said Callie Cox, analyst at investing company eToro. "It\'s anyone\'s guess how crypto acts during a recession."\n\nFor this week, any downside potential "should not be severe" or keep bitcoin from continuing on its uptrend, Hasegawa said.'}, {'id': 23, 'time': 'Mon, 17 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Bitcoin's chart has some eerie parallels to gold in the 1970s - CNBC", 'content': 'Many investors have dismissed the notion that bitcoin could be a type of digital gold since the cryptocurrency has been trading like a speculative risk asset for much of the past two years. But about 50 years ago, gold did the same thing, Morgan Stanley said in a recent note. If bitcoin\'s current moves continue to follow those of gold in the 1970s, the cryptocurrency could be in for some tough times ahead. In 1971, individuals could no longer convert U.S. dollars to a specified amount of gold. Since 2008, governments have become more reliant on central banks creating new fiat currency — money that isn\'t backed by a commodity — to provide support in times of crisis, according to Morgan Stanley\'s note. That\'s different from bitcoin, which has a limited supply. In the \'70s, "gold was tracking the rising rate of consumer price inflation (CPI), which was largely a result of the recent explosion of fiat money supply," said Sheena Shah, a strategist at Morgan Stanley and a coauthor of the note. "Bitcoin, on a logarithmic scale, has so far followed a similar path to the price speculation of gold in the 1970s, which also seemed to follow a four year cycle." Starting in 1971, gold prices quadrupled within four years as the U.S. dollar money supply grew rapidly, the strategist said. "That wasn\'t the height of the speculation, however: from August 1976 to January 1980, the price of gold rose eightfold from $102 to $850." "As the gold price was still managed for the first few years, the similarities may be a statistical coincidence … more likely, in our view, is that both were driven by similar speculation cycles," she added. Bitcoin fans have long highlighted its potential to act as a "digital gold" because it\'s divisible, scarce and doesn\'t rely on a central issuer. They also once argued that bitcoin offered a hedge against equities, but last year\'s market havoc threw cold water on that idea as the cryptocurrency\'s correlation with stocks hit an all-time high . At the end of March, that correlation fell to its lowest since 2021 , while bitcoin\'s correlation with gold has been climbing. After the Federal Reserve loosened monetary policy to support the economy at the start of the Covid pandemic, bitcoin outperformed gold 2.9x over the three-and-a-half-year period, Bernstein recently noted. This year, banking crisis fears in the U.S. helped push bitcoin to even greater gains. —CNBC\'s Michael Bloom and Gabriel Cortes contributed reporting'}, {'id': 12, 'time': 'Mon, 17 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Bitcoin, Ether, other crypto fall as SEC waves big stick; Dogecoin gains; U.S. equity futures flat - Yahoo Finance', 'content': 'Bitcoin fell in Tuesday morning trading in Asia, but held above the US$29,000 mark.

Sentiment around the memecoin got a lift as Twitter – led by Dogecoin fan Elon Musk – officially enabled stock and cryptocurrency trading on the platform on Monday in a partnership with multi-asset investment firm eToro.\n\nSolana dropped 2.02% to US$24.41, but is holding a gain of 16.56% for the week. U.S.-based digital currency asset manager Grayscale Investments opened Grayscale Solana Trust on Monday for public trading on OTC Markets under the symbol: GSOL. The Trust offers investors exposure to the price movement of Solana without holding the asset directly.\n\nThe crypto market was hit by renewed regulatory concerns, as the U.S. SEC charged Bittrex and its co-founder William Shihara for violation of securities laws. Other crypto firms including Kraken, Coinbase, Paxos and Binance have also been targeted by U.S. regulators this year.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler will speak before Congress on Tuesday on his approach to regulating digital assets.

They expected him to start dabbling in stocks. Instead, he began buying cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum.\n\nEddy saved up another $7,000 from summers spent working at a tennis club and other jobs, adding that to his investment fund for a total $12,000 in principal.\n\nAnybody who has been following cryptocurrencies knows where this story is going: Eddy’s $12,000 investment is now worth well over $500,000, a return exceeding 4,100% in just a few years.\n\n“I don’t know if he’s a prodigy, but he’s close,” says Eddy’s father, Gary Zillan. Eddy, now 18, is a high school senior in Orange, Ohio, near Cleveland. He hopes to study dentistry next year at Case Western Reserve University. But if that doesn’t work out, he has a Plan B, since he just launched a company that provides tutorials and insights on cryptocurrencies. “Hopefully he’ll be a multimillionaire by the time he’s my age,” says his father, who is 46.\n\nEddy Zillan, 18, of Orange, Ohio, has amassed well over $500,000 worth of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. (Photo courtesy of Eddy Zillan)\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are suddenly the hottest investment since the dot-com bubble, after a stunning surge in value during the last year.\n\nThe price of bitcoin, the most well-known cryptocurrency, has soared by more than 700% in 2017. Ethereum is up a mind-boggling 3,900% — and early purchasers are suddenly watching the zeroes multiply on their accounts. Many crypto investors are reluctant to talk about their holdings, since alt-currencies are still associated with illicit activity, and they tend to appeal to non-traditionalists in the first place. But we found some willing to tell us their experiences. There are also plenty of detractors who insist cryptocurrencies are Ponzi schemes or worse. Yet regulators may soon bestow validity on cryptocurrencies by allowing broader investments, such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), to track their value.\n\nThe origins of bitcoin\n\nBitcoin is a digital payment system launched in 2009 by a person or group using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. A network of coders with powerful computers has slowly “mined” more bitcoin since then by running complex computations that adhere to a set of founding principles, making bitcoin a kind of crowd-sourced currency. The market value of all bitcoin in the world is around $132 billion at current prices, roughly comparable to the current value of McDonald’s (MCD).\n\nStory continues\n\nOther cryptocurrencies, sometimes referred to as “altcoins,” have emerged as well, including ether, the token of the blockchain network ethereum ($32 billion in market cap), ripple ($9 billion), litecoin ($3.7 billion) and dash ($3.3 billion).\n\nIn a recent Yahoo Finance survey, 77% of respondents told us they have never purchased bitcoin — but of those, 11% said they’re planning to, and 38% said they’re thinking about it. As more people buy in, that interest alone could send the crypto rally even higher.\n\n[See the full results of our bitcoin survey, conducted online Nov. 10-13.]\n\nOrdinary people can buy cryptocurrencies through services like Coinbase, SpectroCoin or Kraken, usually by linking a bank account or credit card and following simple instructions. (Disclosure: I own a small amount of bitcoin.)\n\nOf 1,011 poll respondents saying they’ve purchased Bitcoin, 71% have made money. Source: Yahoo Finance survey conducted via SurveyMonkey\n\nCritics such as JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and hedge-fund titan Ray Dalio see cryptocurrencies as a craze that will eventually implode, akin to tulips or Enron. But Bill Gates, Richard Branson, and Mark Cuban are believers, and many investors think bitcoin and other digital currencies are like the Internet in 1995 — a transformative technology about to erupt.\n\nThe money is certainly real.\n\nBitcoin as currency\n\nPeter Saddington of Atlanta first read about bitcoin in 2011, and bought some for less than $3 per coin. With bitcoin now trading at around $7,500, the return on those early investments is around 250,000%. “I’ve never seen anything like this,” says Saddington, 35, an entrepreneur who has a bachelor’s degree in computer science and three master’s degrees. “What solidified my confidence that this is worth investing in is that the code is based on math. It can’t really be turned off.”\n\n[Had a wild experience with cryptocurrencies? Let us know! Email us at rickjnewman@yahoo.com.]\n\nIn October, Saddington cashed out 45 bitcoins to buy a 2015 Lamborghini Huracán, for the equivalent of about $238,000. He and the seller made the transaction in bitcoin, without using a traditional bank. The transaction fees totaled $7.50.\n\nSaddington, who runs a cryptocurrency social network called TheBitcoin.pub, deliberately sought a supercar he could purchase with bitcoin in order to tout the credibility of the currency. “Buying the Lambo with bitcoin is proof it can be used for real transacti...'}]

"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that there is a bearish trend in the market, with a consistent sell signal on the MACD indicator and a decrease in the open price of ETH. The caution advised by the on-chain analyst suggests that short-term selling strategies may be beneficial in the current market conditions.

On the other hand, the news analyst report presents a more positive outlook, highlighting the recent price increases in Ethereum and Bitcoin. Despite concerns over environmental impact and lack of trust in crypto investments, the market sentiment appears to be bullish, with investors showing confidence in the potential growth of cryptocurrencies.

In reflection, it is evident that a cautious and conservative approach has been effective in navigating the mixed signals in the cryptocurrency market. Prioritizing long-term strategies and staying informed about market conditions have been key factors in maximizing profit and minimizing losses.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is advisable to focus on long-term strategies over short-term gains. While there may be short-term selling opportunities in the current bearish market, the overall bullish sentiment and potential growth in cryptocurrencies like Ethereum suggest that holding onto ETH for the long term may be more beneficial.

Therefore, I would take a slightly conservative approach and hold onto my ETH position, with a trading action confidence level of 0.3. This reflects my belief in the long-term potential of ETH while also acknowledging the short-term market uncertainties.

It appeared first on the Bloomberg Terminal.\n\nWith debt levels at extremes and monetary debasement unlikely to slow in coming years, investors may start to view Bitcoin as a suitable portfolio asset — most likely at the expense of a small portion of fixed-income allocations.\n\nDebasement undercutting asset returns\n\nThe problem with measuring nominal returns of assets is that it obfuscates debasement by monetary inflation. In a fiat system, the monetary base via private credit and central-bank balance sheets must continually expand to ensure the nominal value of collateral backing debt in the system also rises. Sustained periods of nominal price declines (deflation) would ultimately collapse the entire system.'}, {'id': 1, 'time': 'Tue, 18 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Emmer, Hill Push for Regulatory Consistency in the SEC's Treatment of Bitcoin Spot ETP Applications - Tom Emmer", 'content': 'Today, Majority Whip Tom Emmer (MN-06) and Representative French Hill (AR-02) sent a letter to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler regarding Chair Gensler’s regulatory hypocrisy and inconsistency in his treatment of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETP) applications.\n\nOver the last decade, over twenty spot bitcoin ETP applications have been filed with the SEC, but none have been approved. Chair Gensler has denied all bitcoin spot ETP applications in the United States, citing concerns over fraud and manipulation in the market. Chair Gensler, however, has authorized bitcoin futures ETPs to trade, even though the pricing for those futures contracts is derived entirely from the same market he claims is fraught with fraud and manipulation.\n\n“The SEC’s approach to cryptocurrency regulation has been unacceptable,” said Emmer. “Chair Gensler has exhibited regulatory inconsistency between his treatment of bitcoin futures ETPs, which he has allowed to trade in the United States, and bitcoin spot ETPs, which he continually denies the American people from accessing. The SEC must provide consistency of treatment to the marketplace and retail investors in the United States are worse off because of the Chair’s decision to deny all bitcoin spot ETP applications. We look forward to the SEC’s response to our concerns.”\n\nHill said, “The reasoning behind the SEC’s continued refusal to approve a spot bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) appears to be inconsistent and doesn’t take into account what we know from other jurisdictions where regulators have approved similar products. We look forward to Chair Gensler’s appearance before the Financial Services Committee today and his response to our letter.”\n\nBoth Emmer and Hill serve as members of the House Financial Services Committee.\n\nText of the letter is available here.\n\n###'}, {'id': 0, 'time': 'Tue, 18 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'What Is Bitcoin? - Bankrate.com', 'content': "At Bankrate we strive to help you make smarter financial decisions.

The currency broke into mainstream consciousness in 2017, as its price ran up thousands of dollars over the course of the year. More recently, it skyrocketed in 2020 and 2021, as traders saw it as a way to get rich quickly, before plummeting massively in 2022.\n\nBitcoin has created much controversy, from proponents who say it’s the future of currency to those who decry it as a speculative bubble. Here’s what you need to know about Bitcoin, how it works and some of its drawbacks.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin and how does it work?\n\nBitcoin debuted in 2009, when the software underpinning the currency was released. Its origins are a bit mysterious, however, and a person (or pe..."}, {'id': 6, 'time': 'Tue, 18 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'The Best Bitcoin Loan Platforms of 2023 - Blockworks', 'content': 'A bitcoin loan is money, property or goods lent to a borrower using BTC as collateral. It is the permabull’s ultimate hack for using BTC without the FOMO and tax burden that comes with selling.\n\nAlthough the term “bitcoin loan” might be unclear to some, it doesn’t necessarily mean the loan is made in bitcoin. It is only considered a bitcoin loan if the collateral backing the loan is denominated in BTC.\n\nAdditionally, these loans are overcollateralized, which means that the value of the collateralized bitcoin exceeds the loan’s value. For instance, some lenders allow borrowers to borrow up to 50% of the deposited collateral’s USD value. As with traditional loans, borrowers receive their collateral back once they pay off the loan and interest in full.\n\nSo, what is the point if borrowers get back less than what they put in? This article in our series on crypto and bitcoin loans will explain the appeal and the pros and cons of different bitcoin loan platforms.\n\nWhy get a bitcoin-backed loan?\n\nLike all loans, bitcoin-backed loans aim to make the inaccessible or illiquid value of something more accessible in an open market. Traditional lenders do this by making the value of your future work or endeavors available in cash or a line of credit.\n\nBitcoin is more liquid than future work but less accessible than a common medium of exchange. First, only a few merchants and sellers accept bitcoin as payment. But more importantly, because the IRS classifies bitcoin as property, you create a taxable event every time you sell it or exchange it.\n\nThirdly, if you view your BTC holdings as an investment, you want to wait to sell until you have made a return. And if you are a bitcoin permabull, you want to avoid selling BTC for as long as possible. So while bitcoin is considered more liquid than most assets such as property and stocks, it is still less liquid than the cash in your pocket.\n\nHow it saves money\n\nA bitcoin-backed loan makes a portion of that investment available without selling bitcoin, thus retaining any potential upside and avoiding a taxable event. There are many instances where this loan would save the borrower money and even make a profit off the initial investment.\n\nSuppose a borrower uses it to buy a house, flip a used car or even buy more bitcoin. In that case, they can use the investment proceeds to repay the loan without selling any collateral. This strategy is called a leveraged investment and always comes with a degree of risk. For example, if the price of bitcoin drops during the loan duration and the borrower cannot satisfy the collateral requirement, they could lose their initial investment. Borrowers amplify this risk when they use it to buy more bitcoin.\n\nBut if the second investment pays off and the price of bitcoin increases, an investor can pay off the borrowed amount without selling their collateral and paying capital gains. And if bitcoin doubled in price, the investor can avoid selling bitcoin to pay off the loan by using that collateral to take out another bitcoin loan. This process is called rolling your debt, and it can get risky if investors do not save enough capital on the side to account for price volatility.\n\nWhen is the best time to buy?\n\nThe best time to buy BTC used as collateral for a bitcoin loan is after a significant market drawdown. Bitcoin’s historical chart reveals that the leading cryptocurrency has suffered severe pullbacks of over 80% after hitting a new all-time high in a bullish market cycle.\n\nBuying BTC close to a bear market bottom allows investors to maximize the benefits of a bitcoin loan while minimizing the risk of being margin called on their position. However, the difficulty in timing the bottom of a bear market means investors using bitcoin as collateral must be wary of a continued downtrend and hedge against such an outcome. A good rule of thumb is to over-collateralize so that an 80% drawdown from the most recent all-time high won’t liquidate your collateral. Considering a move where the investor uses the credit line to acquire more bitcoin, their portfolio gains substantially as the market trends upwards following a market bottom.\n\nBenefits vs. risks\n\nA bitcoin-backed loan may be a no-brainer given BTC’s historical performance and ability to recover from severe drawdowns. Yet, these loans come with risks that investors must recognize before using the option. This section discusses the benefits and risks when you borrow against BTC.\n\nBenefits\n\nInstant liquidity: Bitcoin is a highly liquid asset compared to other assets such as real estate, bonds, and stocks. A bitcoin loan allows investors to tap into bitcoin’s highly liquid nature within same-day funding. Since loans are overcollateralized, most platforms do not subject users to credit checks and paper filings that could delay access to liquidity as with other financial assets.\n\nGreater returns: Since bitcoin loans allow investors to borrow money without spending their bitcoins, they can generate greater ret...'}]

REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the open price of ETH has been consistently decreasing, along with a decrease in average transaction fees. The MACD signal also indicates a sell trend, suggesting a potential continuation of the market decline in the short term. Additionally, the news analyst report highlights the mixed outlook in the cryptocurrency market, with concerns about macroeconomic factors and security issues. 

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a cautious and conservative approach, prioritizing long-term strategies and risk management, has been effective in maximizing profit. It is important to stay informed about market conditions and consider potential short-term selling opportunities in bearish market conditions.

Considering the overall sentiment and market trends, it is advisable to focus on long-term strategies over short-term gains. A balanced approach that combines conservative and slightly aggressive trading actions may be necessary to capitalize on market opportunities while managing risks effectively.

Therefore, I would take a slightly conservative approach and indicate a trading action of 0.3, reflecting moderate confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain, news, and reflection analyst reports, it is clear that there are mixed signals in the market regarding the future direction of ETH. The on-chain analysis indicates a bearish trend with decreasing open prices and a sell signal on the MACD indicator. On the other hand, the news analyst report suggests a potential bullish trend with positive movements in the cryptocurrency market, especially after the Shanghai upgrade and Bitcoin's surge.

Considering the current market uncertainties and the potential for further price declines in the short term, it is crucial to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains. The reflection analyst report highlights the importance of a cautious and conservative approach, focusing on risk management and thorough analysis to maximize profit effectively.

In conclusion, while there are conflicting signals in the market, it is advisable to adopt a slightly conservative approach and prioritize long-term strategies. Given the bearish trend indicated by the on-chain analysis and the potential for market decline, it is essential to manage risk effectively.

Based on the synthesized reports, I would take a trading action with a confidence level of 0.3, reflecting a cautious approach and a slight inclination towards selling ETH to manage risk in the current market conditions.
ACTION:

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market has been experiencing a downward trend with some potential for a short-term bullish reversal indicated by the recent MACD signal change. The news analyst report highlights the market volatility due to regulatory concerns and economic factors, causing some uncertainty. However, the long-term potential of cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, remains positive.

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a cautious and conservative approach, focusing on long-term strategies and risk management, is crucial in maximizing profit. While news reports can provide valuable insights, prioritizing on-chain analysis and market trends is essential for making informed trading decisions.

Considering the current market uncertainties and the emphasis on long-term strategies, I would take a slightly conservative approach and prioritize risk management. Therefore, I would make a trading action of 0.3, reflecting moderate confidence in the potential short-term bullish reversal but also acknowledging the market volatility and uncertainty. This decision aims to balance potential gains with the need to manage risks effectively in the current market environment.

Melrose has previously achieved success in the Formula Ford 1600 and 2019 GT racing series, and was runner-up in the Netflix TV series “Too Hot to Handle.”\n\nHe expressed his excitement to be entering the Porsche Carrera Cup GB this season with Bitcoin Racing, and the team is looking forward to introducing Bitcoin to a new audience over the 2023 season. The Bitcoin Racing Team aims to bring Bitcoin to a wider audience and is actively looking for additional Bitcoin-related sponsors.\n\nCharles Mackenzie, the team\'s Deputy Principal, expressed confidence that with Melrose\'s skills and the professionalism of the Richardson Racing Team, they could see a podium or two before the end of the season. Mackenzie\'s father, Andrew Mackenzie, is the team\'s principal and an accomplished racing driver.

The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), which closely tracks bitcoin futures, has delivered a similar return.\n\nThough there are many reasons for bitcoin’s recent ascent—including a decline in long-term interest rates and rising appetite for risk among investors—one catalyst that applies to bitcoin specifically is what’s known as the halving.\n\nTo process transactions and keep the blockchain secure, bitcoin relies on the participation of entities called miners who contribute enormous amounts of computing power to the network. In return, the miners receive block rewards (freshly minted bitcoin) as compensation.\n\nThese block rewards are cut in half every 210,000 blocks, or roughly every four years. Currently, block rewards are 6.25 bitcoin per block, and they will fall to 3.125 bitcoin per block after the next halving.\n\nHistorically, the price of bitcoin has risen before, and after these supply reductions, there are many who believe that this time will be no different.\n\nAccording to data from CoinTelegraph, the price of bitcoin was at least 15% higher 150 days after each of the previous three halvings.\n\n\n\nSeparate data from CCData shows that bitcoin rallied ahead of each of those halvings also. The cryptocurrency jumped by 19% in the 12 months leading up to the May 2020 halving; it gained 142% leading up to the July 2016 halving; and it surged 384% leading up to the first halving in November 2012.\n\nAdding Fuel to Crypto ETFs\n\nGiven the strong historical precedent, anticipation of the next bitcoin halving—which is estimated to take place in April or May of 2024—is adding fuel to this year’s bitcoin rally.\n\nIn addition to bitcoin futures tracking ETFs like BITO, funds that hold stocks of companies in the cryptocurrency industry are also rallying on halving excitement.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF (WGMI), the Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF (BITQ) and the Global X Blockchain ETF (BKCH) are up anywhere from 90% to 130% on a year-to-date basis.\n\nThese ETFs tend to rise and fall with cryptocurrencies, so anything that pushes bitcoin prices higher is generally a good thing for them.\n\nNo Guarantees\n\nWhile the bitcoin halving was a bullish catalyst for bitcoin in the past, there’s no assurance that history will repeat itself. As with anything in markets, past performance is no guarantee of future results.\n\nAs bitcoin matures, it won’t necessarily act like it did in its early days. The bullish thesis behind the halving is that with each reduction in block rewards, bitcoin becomes scarcer because there is less new supply coming onto the market.\n\nThat’s true—but it’s also well-known. Bitcoin is designed to have a maximum supply of 21 million; everybody knows that, and in markets, what everybody knows usually isn’t information that can leveraged into outsized returns.\n\nThat doesn’t mean history won’t repeat and bitcoin runs up into the halving and keeps running for a while after.\n\nBut it’s something that a prudent investor probably shouldn’t bet the farm on.\n\nFollow Sumit Roy on Twitter @sumitroy2\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | © Copyright 2023 etf.com.

Let's use it to help save our planet - Yahoo Finance", 'content': 'Despite concerns over Bitcoin mining’s energy consumption, Bitcoin mining has the potential to be a net positive for humanity’s relationship with energy and sustainability. This can be achieved by the mining industry using intermittent, stranded and waste power sources and subsidizing sustainable energy. A less-explored opportunity is to collect and redirect the excess heat generated by Bitcoin mining for other heating needs. This Earth Day, let us consider how Bitcoin mining can not only help our planet and improve humanity’s relationship with energy by serving as a buyer of zero-carbon energy, but it can also serve as a producer of recyclable and reusable energy.\n\nBitcoin’s energy recycling potential\n\nMany of Bitcoin’s critics are understandably worried about Bitcoin’s rising energy consumption. The Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index indicates that Bitcoin’s electricity consumption has only ever gone up since the digital asset’s inception. Similarly, Bitcoin’s greenhouse gas emissions — although there have been ups and downs — have also grown over time.\n\nBut Bitcoin’s energy consumption is not the whole story.\n\nBitcoin mining produces a lot of heat, and harnessing and redirecting that excess heat is not just a theoretical possibility. In fact, there are already plans for a Canadian city to be heated by Bitcoin miners. An energy provider, Lonsdale Energy Corporation, and MintGreen, a Bitcoin mining company, are partnering up to provide at least some of the heat demanded by the residents of North Vancouver.\n\nMintGreen will recycle about 20,000 tons of toxic gas per megawatt that would have otherwise entered the atmosphere and contributed to global warming. Instead, this liability of toxic emissions will be turned into an asset: Over 95% of the energy that the miners initially consume will be converted into thermal energy that will be used to heat several buildings. Since Bitcoin miners can run continuously, and because there will almost certainly always be a supply of Bitcoin miners available, the city will be able to rely on their excess heat during any month of any year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis endeavor is not a pie-in-the-sky dream. MintGreen had already made deals with the Vancouver Island Sea Salt facility and Shelter Point Distillery to sell them heat during frigid Canadian winters.\n\nBitcoin mining’s versatility also allows its excess heat to be used for recreational ends. For example, it costs between US$2,000 and US$5,000 to heat a typical swimming pool. Bitcoin mining can turn this money sink and associated energy consumption into a zero-cost endeavor. All you have to do is connect your Bitcoin mining machine to your pool’s water pump. You simultaneously earn the hardest asset ever created and heat your pool at no additional charge.\n\nWhile heating a swimming pool is an amusing application, Bitcoin miners’ excess heat has more profound use cases for humanity. Companies are already collaborating with researchers to create greenhouses that are heated by Bitcoin mining.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the heat from Bitcoin mining is warming a greenhouse for tulips and cutting the flower farmers’ reliance on gas, which has become more expensive since Russia’s war on Ukraine. In Sweden, another mining company’s 600-kilowatt ASIC machines’ heat is directed toward warming a 300-square-meter greenhouse in which fruit and vegetables are grown. The miners are embedded in a data center container, which is fitted with an air duct apparatus that draws heat from the ASICs and sends it to the greenhouse. In theory, this would keep the greenhouse at 77 degrees Fahrenheit continuously. Considering that the temperature of the area drops to minus 22 degrees Fahrenheit in wintertime, the potential savings on heat costs and use are significant.\n\nJust as Bitcoin mining can make good use of intermittent, stranded and waste energy sources, recycling and reusing miners’ waste heat can potentially increase the profitability and sustainability of indoor farming and food production. As one researcher said, “A 1 [megawatt] data center would have the ability to strengthen the local self-sufficiency up to 8% with products that are competitive on the market.”\n\nSimmering tensions\n\nNot everyone is excited about Bitcoin miners’ heat, especially those who suffer from its unintended consequences. For example, residents near Seneca Lake in upstate New York have complained that a nearby power plant’s collaboration with over 8,000 miners has caused their lake to “feel like you’re in a hot tub.”\n\nThe power plant takes in 139 million gallons of water from the lake and gives back 135 million gallons every day. The water that is recycled back into the lake gets up to 108 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer. To be sure, solutions can in principle be found, but we must nevertheless admit that sometimes miners’ heat can affect a community’s environment in ways that people do not enjoy.\n\nSustainable energy sources still matter\n\nAside from Bitcoin m...'}]

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market has been experiencing a downward trend with some potential for a short-term bullish reversal indicated by the recent MACD signal change. The news analyst report highlights the market volatility due to regulatory concerns and economic factors, causing some uncertainty. However, the long-term potential of cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, remains positive.

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a cautious and conservative approach, focusing on long-term strategies and risk management, is crucial in maximizing profit. While news reports can provide valuable insights, prioritizing on-chain analysis and market trends is essential for making informed trading decisions.

*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
After reviewing the reports from the on-chain analyst, news analyst, and reflection analyst, it is clear that the market sentiment for ETH is currently uncertain and volatile. The on-chain data shows fluctuations in fees, trading activity, and market participation, while the MACD signal indicates mixed sentiment among traders. The news articles suggest a mixed sentiment in the overall cryptocurrency market, with potential shifts in market dynamics and price drops in major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum.

In reflecting on recent trading performance, it is evident that a balanced approach combining cautious and slightly aggressive trading actions has been effective. Prioritizing long-term strategies, risk management, and staying informed on market trends have been key factors in successful outcomes. Given the current uncertainties and cautious sentiment in the market, a slightly conservative trading approach may be warranted to mitigate risks and capitalize on opportunities strategically.

Considering the overall market trend and the importance of long-term strategies, I would take a slightly conservative approach with a confidence level of 0.4. This means that I would lean towards selling ETH to manage risks and potentially capitalize on market uncertainties. By prioritizing long-term strategies and risk management, I aim to maximize overall profit in the volatile cryptocurrency market.

Bitcoin had climbed as high as $31,013 on March 14, and has surged around 65% this year, helping to soften the blow from a similar-sized decline in 2022.'}, {'id': 5, 'time': 'Sat, 22 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Bitcoin vs. Gold: Which One Is a Better Investment? - The Motley Fool', 'content': 'Over the past decade, Bitcoin (BTC -0.22%) has catapulted into the spotlight as the premier cryptocurrency. Along the way, multiple narratives have arisen to justify an investment in Bitcoin. One of those is that it is like "digital gold" because, like gold, it can act as a store of value and a hedge against inflation.\n\nSo if Bitcoin is basically digital gold, which is the better investment?\n\nThe tale of the tape\n\nTo start, let\'s talk about the concept of a store of value. A store of value is an asset that preserves wealth and acts as a counter to economic declines and inflation, with the expectation that it will also appreciate over time. Gold has long been considered to meet this criterion.\n\nWhen we compare the price of both since Bitcoin was created in 2009, it becomes clear that while gold does a fair job at preserving wealth, it comes nowhere near the combination Bitcoin provides of preserving and growing wealth.\n\nWhat the numbers say\n\nSince 2009, the inflation-adjusted return of gold annually has been about 3.3%, and the total return has been about 57%. In the same period, Bitcoin has an inflation-adjusted annualized return of nearly 145% and a total return of 33,983,965%.\n\nNow, clearly there is a flaw in this comparison because gold has been in existence for millennia and Bitcoin has only been around for 14 years. So let\'s take it back further.\n\nSince 1980, gold\'s performance has proven lackluster, generating an annualized return of 3.1% before inflation. After we account for 40 years of inflation, gold produced an unappetizing annualized return of -0.24% and a total return of -10.1%.\n\nFrom this angle, it becomes clear that not only does Bitcoin outpace gold in terms of preserving wealth as a store of value and as a hedge against inflation, it also does an excellent job of growing wealth.\n\nWhy Bitcoin?\n\nBut to truly understand how Bitcoin has risen to this level, it helps to understand how it improves upon some of the primary characteristics that originally made gold attractive to investors.\n\nBitcoin and gold both exist in finite amounts. But Bitcoin takes this a step further. While gold is finite in the sense that it is a physical resource that needs to be mined, its supply is not fixed and can fluctuate based on mining activity and new discoveries. However, Bitcoin\'s supply is fixed at 21 million coins, and new coins will gradually enter circulation at a diminishing rate until the year 2140, when the last Bitcoin will be mined.\n\nAnother advantage of Bitcoin over gold is its portability and ease of transfer. Bitcoin can be sent anywhere in the world in a matter of minutes, without the need for intermediaries such as banks or payment processors. All one needs is an internet connection.\n\nIn addition, Bitcoin has a high degree of divisibility, with each coin divisible into 100 million satoshis. This makes it easier to use Bitcoin as a medium of exchange for small transactions, something that isn\'t as feasible with gold. While Bitcoin as form of currency hasn\'t quite materialized like some might hope, there is progress being made thanks to growing adoption of payment solutions like the Lightning Network.\n\nFinally, it is worth mentioning the technological advancements that Bitcoin represents. Bitcoin is built on blockchain technology, a decentralized digital ledger that is immutable and transparent. This means that every transaction that takes place on the Bitcoin network is verified and recorded on the blockchain, making it virtually impossible for anyone to alter or manipulate the data. This level of transparency and security is unprecedented in the world of finance and represents a significant leap forward.\n\nConsider these additional characteristics and the simple fact that Bitcoin has recently dominated gold in terms of its performances as a store of value and inflation hedge, and it becomes clear that an investment in Bitcoin today could prove valuable. In a world that is becoming increasingly digital and as the need for alternatives to inflation-prone fiat currencies persists, Bitcoin is in a unique position to benefit for decades to come as increased demand runs up against its finite supply.'}]

However, in recent years, its volatility has been steadily decreasing, and this trend looks poised to continue in the future.\n\nHere's why this shift could be the under-the-radar catalyst that leads to Bitcoin's continued success in the coming years and decades.\n\nWhy Bitcoin is volatile\n\nTo start, let's look at why Bitcoin experiences such dramatic price fluctuations. First, it is traded internationally 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It isn't limited to set hours like the stock market. With people all over the world trading at all hours of the day, substantial swings can and do occur.\n\nSecond, Bitcoin is a relatively new asset. With limited historical data, the market struggles to assign an accurate price, which can also lead to sudden price swings. Unlike traditional assets, which have a history of finding fair value in particular economic conditions, Bitcoin is constantly under pressure to find a more accurate valuation depending on market sentiment, recent news events, and investor behavior.\n\nAlthough Bitcoin remains more volatile than traditional assets like stocks or bonds, there is a clear trend that its volatility has been tempering since the cryptocurrency was invented in 2009, with a considerable decline since 2022.\n\nBut why is this and how can it benefit investors?\n\nA substantial shift\n\nThere may be several reasons Bitcoin is becoming less volatile.\n\nOne of the primary draws of Bitcoin for investors is its use as a store of value. Many investors are now treating Bitcoin as a long-term investment option, rather than a short-term speculative asset. As more people start holding on to their Bitcoin for longer periods of time, the demand for Bitcoin will become more stable, resulting in less price volatility.\n\nIn addition, the Bitcoin market is maturing. The world's first cryptocurrency is no longer just a niche investment alternative for a few tech-savvy investors. It's now a mainstream investment option for millions of people and even some institutions.\n\nThe combination of these factors helped Bitcoin's total market cap rebound and stabilize after plunging last year. The market cap size alone -- now at almost $600 billion, bigger than all but a handful of companies -- makes it harder for large traders or institutional investors to swing the price of Bitcoin, which in turn has reduced its volatility. In other words, the larger Bitcoin's market cap becomes, the harder it is for large buy or sell orders to have an effect on the price.\n\nThe opportunity at hand\n\nSo why is the decreasing volatility of Bitcoin a good thing for investors? Well, quite simply, it turns the narrative of high volatility on its head. Rapidly fluctuating prices have been one of the primary reasons risk-averse investors shied away, but as Bitcoin's volatility decreases, its risk profile becomes more akin to that of other traditional assets that are found in most portfolios. In time, the cryptocurrency could become a more attractive option for portfolios of all risk levels.\n\nEven better, as more investors begin to see Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, the demand for the cryptocurrency should continue to grow, which will in turn not only help to stabilize its price but cause it to rise as the pressures of increased demand meets Bitcoin's finite supply of 21 million coins.\n\nThis won't happen overnight, but data show Bitcoin's volatility has been diminishing over the years. Ahead of the day when Bitcoin becomes a legitimate asset for investors of all risk levels, it makes investing today a promising opportunity with the cryptocurrency still almost 60% below its all-time high."}, {'id': 4, 'time': 'Sun, 23 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is now home to an innovative leverage trading app - Cointelegraph', 'content': 'Decentralized finance (DeFi) is one of the largest sectors in crypto. The applications within the DeFi space consist of decentralized trading, borrowing and lending, and many more financial services. However, even with its rising popularity, the sector has many obstacles to overcome before mass adoption is possible.\n\nThe rise of DeFi\n\nThe growth of DeFi’s popularity was volatile and quick, which follows suit with the overall development of the crypto industry. During the peaks of 2021, the sector saw almost $180 billion in total value locked in the many protocols that still exist today. Of course, the DeFi space also got hit by the crypto winter.\n\nRecently, DeFi stood out in the market upturn during the first quarter of 2023. The DeFi space rose $29.6 billion in value, making the sector stand out against the performances of major asset classes like gold and oil.\n\nThe popularity of DeFi can be attributed to the increasing amount of decentralized applications (DApps) and the flow of users from centralized to decentralized exchanges, among other reasons. However, while the increasing popularity is a positive development, there are some caveats.\n\nRise in transaction costs\n\nOne of the caveats is the rising transaction costs once more users start using a network. Investors experienced this during the bull market in 2021; the Ethereum (ETH) network saw a large influx of transactions, mainly happening within the DeFi space. The result was steeply rising transaction costs on the network. Sending crypto became so expensive that users faced a significant barrier to interacting with DeFi DApps.\n\nAnother risk is that of vulnerabilities such as smart contract back door keys, massive centralization on single contracts, and counter-party risks of custodial stablecoins. With numerous bridge hacks plaguing the space, and failures of algorithmic protocols such as Terra, using DeFi DApps is certainly not without risk. However, the industry keeps evolving, with many new platforms aiming to improve the issues and challenges current DApps deal with.\n\nDeFi on Bitcoin Cash\n\nThanks to the continuous development since its foundation in 2017, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) can also perform as a vibrant environment for smart contract deployment and the creation of DeFi DApps on its UTXO mainchain. One new project that has recently launched is BCH Bull.\n\nWith the help of the AnyHedge protocol, BCH Bull lets users create long or hedge positions on several assets, such as the United States dollar, Bitcoin (BTC) and gold. Users can even add leverage to their on-chain trades. Roger Ver, a well-known Bitcoin Cash supporter and early investor in AnyHedge, said about this use case: “Allowing people to permissionlessly lock the value of their Bitcoin Cash to the price of external legacy currencies is an incredibly useful tool for people who don’t want to deal with cryptocurrency price volatility. That’s why I chose to invest in AnyHedge.”\n\nSource: BCH Bull\n\nScalable and no centralized smart contract risks\n\nThe main difference between comparable apps on Ethereum is that each trade has its own independent smart contract. Once two traders agree on the terms, the smart contract is initiated. This eliminates centralized security risks for smart contracts.\n\nFurthermore, the UTXO-based protocol of Bitcoin Cash prevents high transaction fees and makes the chain scalable, meaning fees don’t increase even if the transaction volume on the network increases.\n\nSince October 2022, BCH Bull has been in beta, in which it has already created and redeemed over 3,000 smart contracts. The project has now been released into full production mode this month. Its growing user base can now initiate up to 90-day-long contracts at 2~3x the previous contract size, enjoying the security and scalability that Bitcoin Cash offers.\n\nLearn more about BCH Bull'}]

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing fluctuations with mixed sentiment among traders. The market indicators suggest uncertainty with potential for both bullish and bearish movements in the near future. The news analyst report, on the other hand, highlights positive factors that could contribute to increased interest and investment in Bitcoin, potentially leading to a bullish trend in the market. 

Reflecting on the recent trading performance, a balanced approach combining cautious and slightly aggressive trading actions has been effective in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. Prioritizing long-term strategies, risk management, and staying informed on market trends have been key factors in successful outcomes.

Considering the current market uncertainties and cautious sentiment, it is important to prioritize risk management and long-term strategies over short-term gains. Therefore, a slightly conservative trading approach may be warranted to manage risks effectively.

"We believe this service will make bitcoin accessible to hundreds of millions of new investors, and it will appeal to experienced users as well, as this is a great way to allow their friends and family members to easily buy and hold bitcoin," said Lee.\n\nThe purchased bitcoin will be delivered on Ballet\'s patented physical storage card, PURE Bitcoin, a variation of Ballet\'s flagship REAL Series cryptocurrency wallet. Similar to the REAL Series wallet, PURE Bitcoin is a stainless steel card that holds the bitcoin in cold storage, with the specific bitcoin denomination clearly shown on each card. This makes each loaded PURE Bitcoin card a physical bearer asset for bitcoin. There are no electronic components, providing superior durability and protection from cybersecurity threats such as hackers and malware. It\'s designed with tamper-evident security and anti-counterfeiting measures, and just like the REAL Series, it\'s incredibly easy to use. Once the customer receives their loaded PURE Bitcoin card, they can easily move the bitcoin on-chain to their wallet of choice. Alternatively, customers can choose to leave the bitcoin on the PURE Bitcoin cold storage card for long-term safekeeping. The bitcoins are held safely in cold storage on this physical card using Ballet\'s patented 2FKG implementation of the open-source BIP38 industry standard, which allows the user to generate the private keys to their digital bitcoins privately, at the time and location of their choosing.\n\nStory continues\n\nBy offering a retail experience similar to purchasing gold and silver coins, Ballet\'s new service aims to bridge the gap between traditional investment options and the surging demand for bitcoin. For the first time ever, customers can place an order on Ballet\'s website and then take physical delivery of their bitcoin securely, all without the need to use an online cryptocurrency exchange. By eliminating the need for an exchange, this service minimizes potential exposure to cybersecurity threats and reduces the learning curve for new Bitcoin users. Ballet is currently selling physical PURE Bitcoin cards in denominations of 0.1, 0.025, 0.01, and 0.005 BTC.\n\nThe innovative, user-friendly design of PURE Bitcoin cards makes them an ideal gift option for those looking to introduce friends and family to the world of bitcoin investing. They can also be advantageous for inheritance purposes, because unlike other cryptocurrency storage methods, heirs would not need technical expertise to access private keys or encrypted digital wallets.\n\nBallet is currently offering bitcoin for sale in the United States in states where regulations allow, with work ongoing to expand availability into more jurisdictions.\n\nBitcoin for physical delivery can be purchased at: https://bitcoin.ballet.com/\n\nAbout Ballet:\n\nBallet is a US-based cryptocurrency wallet company founded in 2019 by Bobby Lee, the former CEO of BTCC, one of the world\'s first and largest Bitcoin exchanges.

Standard Chartered's prediction of Bitcoin potentially reaching $100,000 by the end of 2024 reflects optimism in the market. However, concerns raised by Chamath Palihapitiya about regulatory challenges in the U.S. impacting the crypto industry may lead to uncertainty. Additionally, Ballet's innovative service of selling Bitcoin for physical delivery could attract new investors and bridge the gap between traditional investments and digital assets. Overall, the market trend may see fluctuations in the short term due to regulatory concerns but could potentially see growth in the long term with increasing adoption and innovative services.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the reports from the on-chain analyst, news analyst, and reflection analyst, it is clear that the market sentiment for ETH is currently uncertain and volatile. The on-chain data shows fluctuations in fees, trading activity, and market participation, while the MACD signal indicates mixed sentiment among traders. The news articles suggest a mixed sentiment in the overall cryptocurrency market, with potential shifts in market dynamics and price drops in major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum.

In reflecting on recent trading performance, it is evident that a balanced approach combining cautious and slightly aggressive trading actions has been effective. Prioritizing long-term strategies, risk management, and staying informed on market trends have been key factors in successful outcomes. Given the current uncertainties and cautious sentiment in the market, a slightly conservative trading approach may be warranted to mitigate risks and capitalize on opportunities strategically.

Considering the overall market trend and the importance of long-term strategies, I would take a slightly conservative approach with a confidence level of 0.4. This means that I would lean towards selling ETH to manage risks and potentially capitalize on market uncertainties. By prioritizing long-term strategies and risk management, I aim to maximize overall profit in the volatile cryptocurrency market.

CoinVertible’s pitch is to offer legal certainty, collateral transparency and interoperability with TradFi — all in the spirit of MiCA — but only for clients who are approved using SocGen’s existing know-your-customer procedures.'}, {'id': 4, 'time': 'Tue, 25 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Bitcoin is still the future of payments, says Lightspark CEO David Marcus - The Verge', 'content': 'We’ve got a special episode with Alex Heath, deputy editor at The Verge and a familiar host for Decoder listeners, and David Marcus, the CEO of Lightspark. That’s a company that just launched a service to make fast transactions using Bitcoin on something called the Lightning Network. David was previously at PayPal, and then he led Meta’s big payments effort that went nowhere, but he’s got a lot to say about where crypto and payments are right now.\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity.\n\nNilay Patel: Alex, welcome.\n\nAlex Heath: Hey.\n\nNP: It’s good to have you back. Why did Lightspark catch your eye? What did you find interesting about this little startup?\n\nAH: Yeah, I don’t cover crypto all the time, but I do pay attention to what David Marcus is doing. He is a Bitcoin OG and has been in the space for a long time. And he had quite a journey trying to launch Facebook’s cryptocurrency.\n\nNP: David was the president of PayPal, and then we should talk about what happened at Facebook just for a second. Facebook wanted to launch a new cryptocurrency called Libra, was going to do it with governments around the world and different payment services, and it collapsed under the weight of its political ambitions. And now, David is back with a much leaner, simpler startup. Did you talk about the difference between those two ideas?\n\nAH: We did. Libra, for people who don’t remember, it feels like a blur now, this was in 2019, Facebook was going to do this stablecoin that was David Marcus’ brainchild, really, and he led it inside the company. And it met a lot of resistance for several reasons, but mainly, I think when you talk to people who worked on it, it was because Facebook was doing it, but there were also concerns just about a private company of that size creating a currency, and it was based on a basket of fiat currencies rather than just one pure cryptocurrency.\n\nThis gets kind of in the weeds, but I think the distinction is important because David has essentially decided that, for his next company — and interestingly, he took a lot of the founding team that made Libra with him at Facebook to Lightspark with him — that it’s going to be simpler for him to just build on top of Bitcoin. He chose that instead of all the other cryptocurrencies, layer one networks out there, ethereum, etc.\n\nAnd I think David, out of pretty much anyone in the industry, knows the most about the regulatory environment around crypto because, when he was doing Libra, he testified in front of Congress. I remember there was a photo of [Mark] Zuckerberg’s face on the dollar bill, with Zuck Bucks displayed behind him at one point. He had to meet regulators all around the world. They tried incorporating Libra in several different countries, including Switzerland. This is a guy who knows the global regulatory situation around crypto better than anyone. So the fact that he decided to make a company that he told me he hopes to be his life’s work around Bitcoin, specifically, I thought was interesting.\n\nNP: Yeah, that’s actually a really interesting part to me. We lived through what I would call crypto summer last year, where the hype was off the charts. There was a lot of conversation about ethereum, these other coins. I think that has all fallen by the wayside. It’s interesting to me that, out of all that wreckage, Dave Marcus is back, and he’s saying Bitcoin is it, and it’s still viable, and he’s managed to raise a bunch of money with that pitch.\n\nAH: Yeah, he’s raised a lot of money and the company’s pretty lean, but I think his goal is to scale Bitcoin as a payments network. He’s a payments guy through and through. That’s what he was doing at PayPal. He led the acquisition of Braintree and Venmo when he was there — and what he was trying to do at Facebook when he was working on Messenger before Libra even had to do with payments. So this has really been his life’s work, and he sees the opportunity thanks to this thing called a layer two network, which is this network that sits on top of Bitcoin, called Lightning, to let people actually transact using Bitcoin.\n\nAnd the most interesting part of all this is that he thinks people don’t even need to know that Bitcoin is the network they’re using to transact with because Lightning is that fast, and he actually sees companies using it to settle back into fiat on both sides of the transaction, so legal tender in real time. And I think that’s really interesting because he’s basically saying, with this network, we can obfuscate crypto out of the equation for the end consumer, and they don’t even need to know that they’re using it necessarily.\n\nNP: That’s fascinating. Did you ask him the only question I ever want to ask anybody about Bitcoin, which is, if I have a Bitcoin, why would I ever spend it?\n\nAH: Well, that gets to the whole reason he’s doing the company, which is he agrees that Bitcoin is, in its current state, a bad thing to transact with. It fluctuates. The idea with Lightning and th...'}]

So now more than ever, we need their help,” said Rolf Skar, campaign director at Greenpeace USA, a non-profit environmental advocacy organization.\n\nIt is a complex situation. But here is a guide to the key issues.\n\nWhat is bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is a type of cryptocurrency, a decentralized form of currency that is strictly digital rather than physical – unlike dollars, pounds or euros. It is managed and traded on a public, open ledger known as a “blockchain” that records all bitcoin transactions. Though not commonly done, bitcoin can be used to buy material goods.\n\nHow does bitcoin cause environmental damage?\n\nBecause cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin are not centralized, there is no singular authority or body to verify transactions. Instead, participants in the bitcoin network “mine”, or compete to solve cryptographic puzzles to generate more of the currency. Whoever solves the puzzle the fastest gets to verify transactions for the chance to add the newest batch of them to the blockchain.\n\nThe winner is financially rewarded with new cryptocurrency in this process, referred to as “proof of work” (PoW) – the culprit for greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe PoW consensus algorithm used to verify transactions requires large amounts of electricity which is often produced by burning fossil fuels, emitting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that are heating the planet.\n\nA 2022 report, titled Revisiting Bitcoin’s Carbon Footprint, conducted by climate and economics researchers across Europe estimates that “Bitcoin mining may be responsible for 65.4 megatonnes of CO 2 per year … which is comparable to country-level emissions in Greece (56.6 megatonnes in 2019).”\n\nWhat do environmental groups want?\n\nThere is a recent push by some environmentalists to reduce the environmental impact of bitcoin by changing the way it is produced.\n\nView image in fullscreen The Greenidge Generation bitcoin mining facility, in a former coal plant by Seneca Lake in Dresden, New York. Photograph: Ted Shaffrey/AP\n\nSo groups such as Greenpeace are calling out Fidelity and other financial management and payment process companies that have ventured into bitcoin mining. Hence the recent targeting of Fidelity. Skar said that although Fidelity responded to Greenpeace when the group reached out, the response was lackluster.\n\n“[Fidelity] seem not to want to talk about the issue. They declined [our request to speak] so far, but it’s an invitation for them and others to step up and put resources towards solutions to deal with the problem of bitcoin mining globally. We think it can be done,” Skar said.\n\nHow could ‘changing the code’ mitigate environmental damage?\n\nThe solution, Greenpeace argues, is simple: change the computer code that produces bitcoin in order to consume less electricity and reduce its carbon footprint.\n\nThis code is open-source, meaning it is publicly accessible to anyone who wants to see or use it.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to TechScape Free weekly newsletter Alex Hern's weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Its decentralized and trustless attributes have made the leading crypto one to hold against a backdrop of multiple bank collapses. In fact, delivering gains of 70% though Q1 made it the quarter’s best performing asset.\n\nAnd it has got plenty more room to run, says Geoff Kendrick, head of crypto research at British banking giant Standard Chartered. “We see potential for Bitcoin to reach the $100,000 level by end-2024, as we believe the much-touted ‘crypto winter’ is finally over,” Kendrick noted.\n\nThat’s a gain of 240% from current levels, a surge that will be hard to find elsewhere. For many, though, buying bitcoin directly still represents somewhat of a complicated act but there are ways to get skin in the game without directly purchasing the asset. The stock market presents opportunities with many names operating in the bitcoin ecosystem – miners in particular – and their performance naturally correlates with that of the daddy of crypto. Hence, if bitcoin is set to surge so will many bitcoin-themed stocks.\n\nWith this in mind, we delved into the TipRanks database and pulled up the details on 3 crypto stocks poised to make use of that anticipated run. What’s more, all 3 are rated as Strong Buys by the analyst consensus. Let’s take a closer look.\n\nCleanSpark, Inc. (CLSK)\n\nWe’ll start with CleanSpark, a bitcoin miner that sometime ago decided bitcoin mining was where it’s at. While once the company specialized solely in microgrid solutions, it began dabbling in mining operations toward the end of 2020. However, since then, mining endeavors have become its main priority.\n\nCleanSpark oversees its own mining operations in Atlanta, Georgia and co-locates miners in Massena, NY. Bitcoin is famous for being hugely energy intensive, but the company likes to highlight its credentials as a sustainable player, mining the bulk of its BTC with renewable or low-carbon energy sources. By often selling its mined bitcoin, the company has funded expansion and last year, even as the crypto winter raged, increased its hashrate – the measure of the computational power used to mine the asset – from 2.1 EH/s in January to 6.2 EH/s at the end of the year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company has set its sights on bringing that hashrate up to 16.0 EH/s by the end of 2023, and recent purchases will go toward making that goal a reality. The company recently announced a purchase of 45K new Antminer S19 XP machines that when eventually deployed will almost double the current hashrate.\n\nAccording to H.C. Wainwright analyst Mike Colonnese, the company exhibited some canny business nous when securing the deal which comes roughly two months following the company’s purchase of 20,000 Bitmain rigs for a 25% discount.\n\n“CLSK secured the machines for a very attractive $23/TH (before applying coupons), the lowest we’ve seen in the market for these rigs, and 12% below the going rate for high efficiency ASICs (under 25 J/TH), based on Luxor’s Bitcoin ASIC Price Index,” the analyst explained.\n\n“Management has been very opportunistic in acquiring new mining rigs at rock bottom prices over the past year, which we believe will drive significant shareholder value, and with this latest purchase, the company has now secured 99%, or 15.9 EH/s of the miners required to reach its year-end 2023 hash rate target of 16 EH/s… We continue to view the stock as significantly undervalued relative to fundamentals,” Colonnese added.\n\nOverall, CLSK shares have soared 98% year-to-date, but Colonnese sees ample growth ahead. Calling CLSK a ‘top pick,’ the analyst rates the shares a Buy while his $12 price target makes room for 12-month returns of a whooping 194%. (To watch Colonnese’s track record, click here)\n\nThis bitcoin miner has garnered two other recent reviews and both are positive, making the consensus view here a Strong Buy. The $8.33 average target might represent a more modest objective, but could still yield gains of a handsome 104% over the next year. (See CLSK stock forecast)\n\nHIVE Blockchain Technologies (HIVE)\n\nThe next bitcoin miner we’re looking at is HIVE Blockchain Technologies. Fun fact: in 2017, HIVE became the first publicly traded crypto miner. The company actually got its start as a GPU-based miner of Ethereum but in 2020 it also began mining bitcoin and has expanded is operations since then. The company has a commitment to ESG practices and mines its bitcoin using green energy, making use of favorable power costs and renewable energy sources with mining operations in Canada, Iceland, and Sweden.\n\nTouting its BTC credentials, the company aims to foster long-term shareholder value with the OG practice of HODLing – keeping its bitcoin close to its chest.\n\nThat said, HIVE saw a big drop in its revenue stream in the most recent financial report – for its fisc...'}]

If you look internationally, gold is, for central banks, the third highest reserve asset," the Bridgewater Associates founder said. "First is dollars, then euros, then gold, and Japanese yen. And central bankers are buying gold, and they\'re not buying bonds.

Secure your seat today\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has historically moved in the opposite direction of the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which gauges the greenback\'s exchange rate against major fiat currencies, including the euro.\n\nThe negative correlation has strengthened, reversing the brief let-up witnessed in late March, and indicating the possibility of accelerated gains in the cryptocurrency in the case of a continued dollar slide following the release of the U.S. gross domestic product data on Thursday.\n\nThe 90-day correlation coefficient between bitcoin and the dollar index has slipped to a two-month low of -0.70, according to data from charting platform TradingView. It had weakened to -0.11 four weeks ago.\n\nCorrelations are measured on a scale of -1 to +1. Values skewed toward -1 indicate that lower prices for one variable are associated with higher prices for the other.\n\nThe 90-day correlation coefficient of -0.70 suggests a notably strong negative relationship between the two assets. (TradingView/CoinDesk)\n\nBitcoin and the DXY have been mostly negatively correlated over the past three years, except in times where crypto-specific factors overshadowed the dollar trends. For instance, bitcoin fell in late 2022 as the collapse of crypto exchange FTX kept investors from cheering weakness in the U.S. currency. A similar breakdown was seen in the lead-up to Coinbase\'s (COIN) Nasdaq debut in April 2021 and the launch of a futures-based exchange-traded fund in the U.S. the following October.\n\nFocus on GDP\n\nAt 12:30 UTC, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis will release its preliminary estimate of first-quarter GDP. The data is likely to show the world\'s largest economy grew at an annualized rate of 2.0%, a slower pace than the 2.6% growth in the fourth quarter last year, according to Reuters estimates published by FXStreet.\n\nSeveral economic indicators and bond market metrics have been warning of a recession for months. The dollar index has declined by over 12% since early October in the hopes that the Federal Reserve would halt its interest-rate hikes and resort to liquidity easing to support the economy.\n\nStory continues\n\nBesides, traders are back to pricing three interest-rate cuts by year end in the wake of issues at First Republic Bank (FRC), even though the Fed didn\'t cut rates and maintained a hawkish or anti-stimulus bias following the banking crisis episode of March.\n\nWith so much dovish expectations already in the air, the GDP figure might have to indicate a sharper-than-expected moderation in economic activity to trigger a deeper dollar sell-off and rally in risky assets, including cryptocurrencies.\n\nIt also means that a upbeat figure may see markets price out rate cuts and lift the dollar higher.\n\n"The market eyes growth at 2% – shouldn\'t move markets too intently given the backward nature of the data point – would need to be a big beat/miss to the move rates expectations and the USD, gold, Nasdaq," Chris Weston, head of research at foreign-exchange brokerage Pepperstone, said in a tweet.\n\nAt press time, bitcoin was changing hands at $29,010, up 2% in the past 24 hours.

They provide advantages over conventional, centralized currencies. We’ll look at the seven main benefits of Bitcoin and similar decentralized currencies to see why they’re gaining popularity. Let’s get started, so make yourself a cup of coffee.\n\nWhy Are Decentralized Currencies Gaining Popularity?\n\nBitcoin and other decentralized currencies are gaining popularity because of their many benefits over controlled currencies. The high level of protection and privacy it provides is a significant selling point. Using a decentralized currency allows for transactions to be documented on an unchangeable and publicly shared database called a blockchain. This eliminates the need to provide private information during a transaction, lowering the potential for fraud.\n\nDecentralized currencies save the time and cost of using intermediaries, allowing for quicker and cheaper transaction processing. They are more trustworthy since a single entity does not manage them. The transaction costs are often more affordable than conventional money\n\nDecentralized currencies are helpful for those needing access to conventional banking systems since they may be used by anybody with an internet connection, regardless of where they live or their financial standing. Last, some people see Bitcoin and other decentralized currencies as good investment options because of their growth potential.\n\nThe benefits of decentralized currencies are attracting more and more users and investors, and this trend is expected to continue in the years to come.\n\nThe 7 Advantages of Decentralized Currencies\n\nBecause of its many advantages over centralized currencies, decentralized ones like Bitcoin are quickly gaining popularity in the financial sector. Transactions in these digital currencies are recorded on a distributed ledger system known as a blockchain and are not subject to the oversight of any governing body or central authority. Users benefit from increased safety, privacy, and convenience, cheaper transaction costs, and the possibility of value appreciation. This essay will examine the rising popularity of decentralized currencies among users and investors by looking at their top benefits.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdvantages of Decentralized Currencies:\n\n1. Financial Inclusion\n\nThe principle of financial inclusion is that all people, regardless of location or socioeconomic status, should have equal opportunity to use and benefit from the financial system. Banking, loaning, insurance, and other financial services may fall under this category. Sadly, many people need help accessing these services because of the significant obstacles to entry posed by conventional financial institutions, such as account minimums or credit score restrictions.\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies provide a decentralized alternative to conventional banking systems, which may facilitate greater financial inclusion. In contrast to fiat money issued by central banks, decentralized currencies do not need a bank account or a credit history for their use. Instead, access to the internet and a digital wallet is required to make and receive financial transactions.\n\n2. Immunity To Inflation\n\nIt is often believed that decentralized currencies, such as Bitcoin, are unaffected by inflation resulting from either government policy or economic shocks. This is because the quantity of such currencies is usually capped or otherwise preset, protecting them against abrupt spikes in supply that would otherwise cause their value to drop.\n\nYet, traditional currencies often experience inflationary pressures. Inflation may result from governments and central banks increasing the money supply by printing more currency or reducing interest rates. As a result, people may find it more costly to acquire necessities like food and shelter when the value of their currency decreases due to inflation.\n\nIn many cases, the total quantity of money that one may generate is capped for decentralized currencies like Bitcoin. Because of its small supply, it is less vulnerable to inflationary pressures brought on by spikes in production.\n\n3. Transparency\n\nOne of the main benefits of decentralized currencies like Bitcoin is their openness. All transactions on the blockchain are open and available to the public. The system may gain confidence and responsibility from its users if all transactions are public and easily accessible.\n\nIt might be challenging to see who did what and when in conventional monetary systems. Nevertheless, unlike controlled currencies, decentralized currencies are entirely transparent. This might make it harder to verify the legality of a transaction.\n\nThe blockchain is a public database that records every Bitcoin transaction, including the sender’s address, the recipient’s address, and the amount sent or received. The system may gain confidence and responsibility from its users if all transactions are public and easily ...'}]

Friends\' recommendations were the No. 1 motivating factor for new crypto buyers. That share compares with 8% of new investors in more traditional assets like stocks and bonds. The disparity indicates there is "a social element to cryptocurrency investing not evident in equities or bond investing," according to the study.

Despite what looks and sounds like institutional adoption and mainstream advancement, it\'s still very early days for the industry, so getting comfortable with the unpredictability is step one to being a good investor in it, according to Tyrone Ross, president and founder of financial planning firm 401 Financial. "If you make an investment into bitcoin, you understand that this is par for the course, it just is," he told CNBC. "You can dollar cost average in and hold it. Traders who have used a lot of leverage and have gotten liquidated in shorts – those folks have a whole different set of issues than those that are really looking at it as an investment. These moves should not bother you if you are really an investor in bitcoin and understand it." "Believe in the core reasons for which you put money in and hopefully there are some \'narratives\' around that that you can hang on to when it gets really volatile like this," he added. Bitcoin spent much of 2022 being tied to stocks, with inflation data and Fed policy as its main price drivers. That correlation has been sliding since the beginning of this year, but bitcoin remains sensitive to the macro economy. Meanwhile, its correlation with gold spiked in early March when the banking crisis began. This week, just as crypto volatility had returned to pre-banking crisis lows , troubles at First Republic Bank reignited concerns about the health of U.S. banks and bitcoin rallied as much as 8% . Still, investors are holding their breath for the next policy decision by the Fed at its meeting next week – with many expecting a hard landing, and positioning for dollar debasement and interest rate cuts. Additionally, with so much liquidity having been drained from the market these past two months, investors aren\'t trusting any bitcoin rally to turn into the next great bull run. "Because bitcoin takes on a lot of asset profiles – risk asset, store of value, VC-like nascent asset class – investing in it is actually really attractive," said Greg King, CEO of investment company Osprey Funds. "Truly uncorrelated assets, with unpredictable behavior and a positive expected value, are rare jewels in terms of portfolio allocation." "Being highly volatile means that even a small allocation of bitcoin to a portfolio is enough to make the investment noticeable," he added. A very early technology play Looking at the price path on short timeframes, bitcoin will and often does mimic high-risk assets. The volatility will go away though, as it has for other new technology advancements before it, according to Mark Connors, head of research at Canadian investment fund manager 3iQ. He pointed out that over the past 10 years, bitcoin has declined from 5x more volatile than the Nasdaq in 2015 to 3x in 2019, to just 1.8x at the end of last year. "The qualities that make it an exponential grower bear out over periods of quarters and years," he said. "It\'s declining its volatility profile at a greater rate relative to equities," he said. "Mature assets don\'t have high adoption rates," he added. "People already own all the equities they\'re going to own. We\'re not going to have another 20% of people buy equities because there aren\'t 20% of people around to buy equities – birth rates are down, portfolios are mature." Ross had a nuanced view, arguing that bitcoin remains a highly volatile asset. BTC.CM= 1Y mountain Bitcoin over the past year For the past decade traders have tried to understand bitcoin\'s identity, sometimes with little patience for its newness and ability to morph from one thing to another. It was designed to be digital cash for those excluded from the formal financial system. New entrants to the market that came in the 2021 bull run were sold on the idea of a hedge against inflation. They\'ve gotten used to it trading like a stock. "Is it pristine collateral for some folks? Perhaps," Ross said. "Is it a better currency for some folks? Yes. Is it an inflation hedge? It didn\'t seem like it was. Is it safety when First Republic Bank looks like it\'s on the brink of collapse? Sure. But it\'s a speculative asset that is highly volatile and benefits from a very liquid environment," he said. For Ross, it\'s also a technology bet. New crypto investors often overlook the Bitcoin technology, focusing instead on bitcoin the crypto asset. Ross is bullish on its ability to act as a financial system for those who can\'t access bank accounts. "We have a venture capital investment essentially, with liquid pricing," Connors said. "That\'s a combination we\'re not used to, so to ha...'}]

This led to speculations that the hype would be short-lived and interest in ordinals would wane soon.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nOut of the Ordin(al)ry\n\nHowever, at press time, it appeared that inscriptions surpassed one million. This represented roughly 6% of the total activity on the Bitcoin network.\n\nConsequently, the fees associated with ordinals that are paid out to miners rose. This resulted in a decrease in the selling pressure on ordinals.\n\nDue to these factors, Bitcoin miners started seeing growth in terms of revenue generated over the last few days, according to blockchain.com\n\nSpeculations start to rise\n\nHowever, the FUD around Bitcoin could soon stunt this growth. Recently, there was speculation going around that large transactions were being made by the BTC wallets of the U.S. government and Mt.Gox trustees.\n\nFor context, Mt. Gox was once the largest Bitcoin exchange in the world before it filed for bankruptcy in 2014. The exchange suffered a massive security breach resulting in the loss of 850,000 bitcoin, worth around $460 million at the time.\n\nThe court appointed Nobuaki Kobayashi as the trustee to oversee the fair and transparent distribution of the remaining assets and funds to the exchange’s creditors.\n\nAdditionally, Kobayashi sold a significant amount of the remaining bitcoin over the years to pay back the creditors. He currently holds a substantial number of bitcoins which will be distributed to the claimants.\n\nMany stated that the FUD surrounding the government transactions has led to the recent decline in BTC prices.\n\nIt is to be noted that the U.S government was the largest holder of Bitcoin at press time. According to Glassnode’s data, the U.S. government and the Mt.Gox trustee held 205,514 and 137,890 BTC, respectively.\n\nBased on our labels at @glassnode, neither the USG, nor Mt Gox are spending any coins from addresses we monitor.

As the expiry date for 105,000 Bitcoin options draws near, GreeksLive’s data showed that these options have a Put Call Ratio of 0.85.\n\nFurthermore, this ratio suggested that there are more investors betting on a dip in Bitcoin’s price. The options also have a max pain point of $27,000, which is the price level where option holders would face the most significant financial loss. The estimated total value of these options was $3.1 billion.'}, {'id': 2, 'time': 'Sat, 29 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'If U.S. defaults on debt Bitcoin could rise nearly 70%, says Standard Chartered analyst - Fortune', 'content': 'Bitcoin bulls have had a good year so far. If the U.S. defaults on its debt, it could get even better, at least in terms of their Bitcoin investment.\n\nThat’s according to Geoff Kendrick, Standard Chartered’s head of digital assets research. He told Insider this week that a U.S. default—which he called a “low-probability, high-impact event”—could cause Bitcoin to jump by about $20,000, an increase of nearly 70% from current levels.\n\nBitcoin started the year at well below $17,000 but is now hovering near $30,000. That’s still well off its all-time high of nearly $69,000 in November 2021, and some investors who bought Bitcoin around then are no doubt still licking their wounds.\n\nBitcoin, Kendrick predicted, would fare well even if overall cryptocurrencies, which trade more like stocks, did not. “So actually, the optimal trade would probably be long Bitcoin, short Ethereum. That sort of mix would probably be a good expression of this,” Kendrick told Insider.\n\nOn Monday, Kendrick said in a note that Bitcoin could reach $100,000 by the end of 2024 and the “crypto winter” was over. He added that Bitcoin has benefited from its status as a “branded safe haven, a perceived relative store of value and a means of remittance.”\n\nBitcoin’s price shot up earlier this year after Silicon Valley Bank collapsed and fears of a banking crisis mounted.\n\nMeanwhile the debt ceiling crisis has intensified. On Wednesday, House Republicans passed legislation (barely) that would raise the government’s debt ceiling in exchange for spending restrictions. In the weeks ahead, they’ll try to reach a compromise with President Joe Biden that would allow the nation’s debt to be lifted.\n\nIf the U.S. did default on its debt this summer, the consequences would be severe for America and the world. Last month, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned lawmakers that “a default on our debt would trigger an economic and financial catastrophe.”\n\nFew think it will come to that.\n\nBut even without a U.S. default, many Bitcoin bulls see good things ahead. ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood said in February that in five years Bitcoin will hit “roughly $670,000, something like that, and then by 2030, as we see more use cases and more of these insurance policies taken out against fiscal and policy regimes that are not healthy, we think it could pass $1 million.”\n\nBitcoin has plenty of critics and doubters, of course. Mark Mobius, the billionaire cofounder of Mobius Capital Partners, predicted in December that Bitcoin would fall to $10,000 at some point this year. He has said of Bitcoin, “It’s not an investment, it’s a religion.”\n\nEarlier this month, Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett reiterated his long-running skepticism. “Something like Bitcoin, it is a gambling token, and it doesn’t have any intrinsic value,” he told CNBC’s Squawk Box. “But that doesn’t stop people from wanting to play the roulette wheel.”'}, {'id': 5, 'time': 'Sat, 29 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Bitcoin Could Jump Nearly 70% If the US Defaults: Standard Chartered - Markets Insider', 'content': 'Bitcoin could climb by $20,000 if a US default happens, Standard Chartered\'s Geoff Kendrick said.\n\nNot every crypto would act similarly, with some behaving more like equities, he told Insider.\n\n"So actually, the optimal trade would probably be long bitcoin, short ethereum."\n\nNEW LOOK Sign up to get the inside scoop on today’s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business — delivered daily.

In that case, bitcoin could dip by $5,000 initially, then jump by $25,000, he estimated.\n\nAnd not every cryptocurrency would follow bitcoin\'s behavior, he added, with others like ethereum trading more like stocks, which would likely fall in a default.\n\n"So actually, the optimal trade would probably be long bitcoin, short ethereum. That sort of mix would probably be a good expression of this," Kendrick said.\n\nIf Congress fails to lift the $31.4 trillion federal debt limit, a default could come sometime in the summer — an event that could cause seismic ruptures global markets. On Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned a default would be catastrophic for the US economy, sparking mass unemployment, payment failures, and higher rates "into perpetuity."\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith House Republicans and the White House still far from a deal to raise the debt ceiling, yields on three-month Treasurys recently jumped to a 22-year high, as they would mature around a potential default date.\n\nMeanwhile, bitcoin is still recovering from a massive sell-off that began in late 2021 and continued through much of 2022 as the Federal Reserve embarked on an aggressive tightening cycle.\n\nBut bitcoin has rallied nearly 80% so far in 2023 and recently neared $30,000 as First Republic Bank\'s woes reignited fears over the financial sector.\n\nFor his part, Kendrick is already bullish on bitcoin, saying in a note on Monday that it could surge to $100,000 by the end of 2024 due to bank turmoil, bitcoin halving, and the expected end of Fed rate hikes, among other things, though it didn\'t mention the risk of a US default.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n"While sources of uncertainty remain, we think the pathway to the USD 100,000 level is becoming clearer," he wrote.'}, {'id': 44, 'time': 'Sat, 29 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'This Week in Coins: Bitcoin, ICP and Solana Lead Small Market-Wide Rally - Decrypt', 'content': "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub.

In a statement to Decrypt, the exchange cited “the hostile and uncertain regulatory climate in the United States” as the main factor behind the decision to ax the deal.\n\nOn Wednesday, reports emerged that Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao had hired lawyers to defend himself against multiple legal threats filed against him and his exchange by the SEC, the CFTC, and the Department of Justice.\n\nThat day, crypto-friendly Texas Senator Ted Cruz launched a diatribe against the idea of an American central bank digital currency (CBDC) during the Bitcoin Policy Summit.\n\nCBDCs are currently being researched by governments worldwide, including those of the U.S. and the EU. A CBDC is a stablecoin pegged to the local currency, and advocates say they would facilitate online payments while taking advantage of blockchain features like instant settlement and smart contracts. However, critics fear the result would lead to an increase in centralized control over our money, which goes against crypto's very ethos.\n\nCruz argued that U.S. leaders would use a CBDC “to destroy all value of Bitcoin, to destroy anonymity, to destroy decentralization.” He added: “The same people that want to see a CBDC, they hate Bitcoin, and they hate cash. Let's be clear; they don't like cash for exactly the reason I like cash because it is not subjected to centralized control that is not subject to constant surveillance. And so I hope we see growing resistance to a CBDC.”\n\nCBDC skepticism is prevalent in Republican circles. Last month Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Ohio Representative Warren Davidson echoed Cruz’s sentiments.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFinally, at a Bloomberg event on Thursday, Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) CEO Julia Leung announced the special administrative region will launch its crypto licensing regime next month.\n\nThe new rules promise to let retail investors trade significant cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) with fewer restrictions from June 1."}, {'id': 36, 'time': 'Sat, 29 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Visa stablecoin plan, debt ceiling's effect on Bitcoin price: Hodler's Digest, April 23-29 - Cointelegraph", 'content': 'Top Stories This Week\n\nCircle launches cross-chain USDC transfer protocol\n\nCircle launched a cross-chain protocol that enables USDC transfers between the Ethereum and Avalanche blockchains. The protocol works by burning the selected amount of native USDC on the source chain, and minting an equivalent amount of new USDC on the intended destination chain. The protocol essentially makes USDC transfers between the two networks faster and more user-friendly, as prior to its launch, people had to use third-party bridges or a Circle partner to facilitate transfers between the two networks. Additional support for Solana and other blockchains will be added later in 2023.\n\nStablecoin payments: Visa shares plans for ‘ambitious’ crypto product\n\nCuy Sheffield, the head of crypto at Visa, announced a new cryptocurrency-related project, on April 24, focused on stablecoin payments. Details are sparse at this stage; however, Sheffiled shared a job listing relating to the project, with the description noting that the “Visa Crypto Team is building the next generation of products to facilitate commerce in everyone’s digital and mobile lives.” The job listing is seeking candidates with a good understanding of layer-1 and layer-2 solutions, alongside experience with writing smart contracts using the programming language Solidity, among other things.\n\nKraken asks San Francisco court to intervene against IRS demands\n\nCrypto exchange Kraken has fought back against the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) over what it feels is an “unjustified treasure hunt” for user’s trading info. According to court documents, the firm requested a federal court in San Francisco to intervene and ask the IRS to back off. The IRS issued a summons in February demanding additional information on Kraken users who traded $20,000 or more in any single year from 2016 to 2020.\n\nMeta disclosed in its Q1 earnings report that its metaverse unit, Reality Labs, posted a loss of around $4 billion during the quarter. In what has been a costly venture for the firm, the $4 billion loss adds to the $14 billion Reality Labs loss over the entirety of 2022. Still, Meta posted a profit totalling roughly $5.7 billion in Q1 overall, with the firm’s work on artificial intelligence somewhat curbing the losses. Mark Zuckerberg was also not phased by the loss from Reality Labs, as he reiterated that “we continue to expect Reality Labs operating losses to increase year-over-year in 2023” as the firm eyes growth in the long term.\n\nViral clips of Securities and Exchange Commision chair Gary Gensler started circulating this week, showing him take a highly contradictory stance on crypto compared to what he holds now. As it stands, Gensler thinks almost every crypto asset apart from BTC is a security, and has pushed hard to regulate the crypto sector from that viewpoint. However, in a snippet from one of his “Blockchain and Money” lectures from 2018 — while he was working as a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology — Gensler said, “Three quarters of the market is non-securities, it’s just a commodity, cash, crypto.” He even suggested Ether was not a security, despite repeatedly suggesting otherwise over the past couple years.\n\nWinners and Losers\n\nAt the end of the week, Bitcoin (BTC) is at $29,275, Ether (ETH) at $1,900 and XRP at $0.47.

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
The news articles suggest a mixed outlook for the cryptocurrency market, particularly for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). The potential impact of a U.S. default on its debt could lead to a significant increase in Bitcoin's price, with analysts predicting a jump of nearly 70%. However, concerns around regulatory actions, such as the IRS demanding trading information from crypto exchanges like Kraken, and the uncertainty surrounding the debt ceiling crisis could create volatility in the market. Additionally, the rise in interest in Bitcoin ordinals and the positive performance of other cryptocurrencies like Solana and ICP indicate a potential small market-wide rally. Overall, while there are bullish sentiments for Bitcoin's price growth, caution is advised due to regulatory uncertainties and market fluctuations.

The news articles suggest a mixed sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin showing signs of potential growth as it is set to climb for the fourth consecutive month, potentially reaching $105,000 according to a Bloomberg analyst report. However, Ether dipped slightly below $1,900, while other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded lower. The addition of the Sui blockchain to Binance's Launchpool boosted Binance's BNB, but Litecoin led the losers.

"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the data indicates a bullish trend for ETH, with increasing open prices, transaction fees, total size used, total value transferred, number of transactions, and unique addresses. The MACD signal also consistently shows a buy trend, further supporting a positive market sentiment for ETH.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights mixed sentiment in the overall cryptocurrency market, with factors such as Bitcoin's volatility, Ray Dalio's preference for gold, and the impact of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments potentially influencing market trends.

In reflection, it is evident that a long-term strategy, risk management, and staying informed on market trends have been effective in maximizing profitability in the volatile cryptocurrency market. The emphasis on a slightly conservative approach has helped navigate uncertainties and capitalize on opportunities.

Considering the synthesized reports, the overall market trend for ETH appears to be bullish with potential for further growth. Therefore, it is advisable to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains to manage risks effectively and capitalize on long-term growth opportunities in the cryptocurrency market.

Based on this analysis, my trading action would be to buy ETH with a confidence level of 0.7, reflecting a moderately confident and slightly conservative approach to maximize profitability while managing risks appropriately.

During the recent quarter, the 72% rise in the price of Bitcoin allowed MicroStrategy to basically reduce a reserve related to earlier large impairment charges for the cryptocurrency, resulting in a one-time tax benefit of $453.2 million.'}, {'id': 3, 'time': 'Mon, 01 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Bitcoin pulls back to start May as First Republic Bank saga comes to an end - CNBC', 'content': 'Cryptocurrencies took a dip on Monday to start the week and new month as investors bet the takeover of First Republic Bank could put an end to the financial crisis, which has been the biggest driver of this year\'s bitcoin rally.\n\nBitcoin fell about 4.2% to 28,137.76 to start the week and new month, according to Coin Metrics. Ether lost 4% to 1,828.81.\n\nOn Monday regulators took possession of First Republic, making it the third U.S. bank failure this year and the biggest one since the 2008 financial crisis. JPMorgan Chase will acquire most of its deposits and assets.\n\nLast week, the price of bitcoin rallied in the final week of April as troubles at the bank unfolded. Trading of the cryptocurrency has been choppy, however, as investors straddle the effects of the banking crisis on crypto with high inflation, Federal Reserve policy, a potential recession and an increasingly bearish narrative building around the U.S. dollar.\n\n"It\'s unclear whether the banking crisis narrative can continue to be a boon for bitcoin," said Alex Thorn, head of firmwide research at Galaxy. "Overall, the market lacks clear positive near-term catalysts, with supply issues overhanging bitcoin … That being said, bitcoin accumulation by small addresses is outpacing issuance, and we expect Ethereum staking to increase, each of which provides a supportive supply narrative."\n\n"Outside of crypto-native factors, we expect a back-of-the-year macro environment to be characterized by tightening, recession, and an expanding multipolarity in the global economy, all of which can be supportive of gold and bitcoin," he added.\n\nInvestors have been expecting a slowdown from bitcoin\'s first-quarter rally, although cryptocurrency remains on its upward trend and has gained about 70% for the year, after finishing down more than 60%. April marked the first time in two years that bitcoin notched a fourth consecutive positive month.\n\n"Bitcoin and ether started 2023 inorganically cheap, allowing for plenty of room to move higher off a low-base effect," Thorn said. "A widening banking crisis became evident in March and the contrast with Bitcoin\'s transparent and decentralized nature provided a further leg up for bitcoin, while Ethereum\'s successful Shanghai upgrade provided a catalyst for ethereum."'}, {'id': 1, 'time': 'Mon, 01 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Invest in Bitcoin?

That has led not just to a surge in Bitcoin investing but also in Bitcoin mining .\n\nI have tried my luck at it, albeit with rather small sums compared to some, but it taught me that seeing it as an investment is the wrong course of action for most. Unless you really, really know what you are doing, then it’s a gamble, akin to playing the tables in Vegas.\n\nSubscribe to Kiplinger’s Personal Finance Be a smarter, better informed investor.

That’s my view, and you may disagree, but here’s why I think so.\n\nWhy Bitcoin is closer to gambling than investing\n\nWhen you invest in the stock market or in commodities you can at least do some research to help inform your decision. How has this fund manager performed? What is this company’s growth plans? Or, what do experts think will happen to the price of gold?\n\nThese are all questions you can answer using research to help inform you of potential outcomes. You can also get financial advice from experts who know the markets and the system.\n\nOf course, most investors know that there is always the risk of their investment tanking due to big world events such as COVID-19, or due to more localized or company-specific issues.\n\nYet few stocks or commodities have experienced the white-knuckle ride of Bitcoin, and that propensity for it to move suddenly, sometimes seemingly with no warning, is why it is so much harder to predict, and why it is closer to gambling than investing in my view.\n\nOne reason Bitcoin is hard to predict is because the mechanics behind it are so complex that most people don’t understand them and therefore don’t have the same knowledge they have of more traditional investments.\n\nI suspect die-hard crypto experts who do nothing but study Bitcoin and other similar currencies such as Ethereum will disagree with me, but this article isn’t aimed at them, but at the less-well-informed majority.\n\nMy Bitcoin loss\n\nA few years ago when everyone seemed to be talking Bitcoin up during one of its highs, I bought $300 of it. I saw it rise to about $500, then drop suddenly, only to go back up again.\n\nAfter a few months later, I withdrew it all at a loss of $50. I could swallow a $50 hit and I saw the experience as a bit of fun to see what would happen to the $300.\n\nThe problem is, I had no idea why it was going up or down and saw no way to even remotely forecast which way it would go. I didn’t like the feeling that I had no control at all.\n\nDon’t get into Bitcoin unless you understand the risks\n\nBitcoin is having a good 2023, with its value up 75% year-to-date. That may encourage some people to try their luck.\n\nI say go for it if you want to have some fun, but only with money you can afford to lose, unless you really consider yourself a cryptocurrency expert.\n\nBut please beware the many companies out there trying to sell you a Bitcoin “investment” as a sure-fire way to make money. You may get lucky but you may as easily get burnt.\n\nWhether you agree or disagree, feel free to tweet me @guyanker.'}]

On Monday alone, over 372,000 inscriptions were created on the Bitcoin network—contributing to a daily record 682,281 Bitcoin transactions—with daily network fees hitting 23 BTC, or around $656,000.\n\nI can't believe my eyes BRC-20 demand leading to a 700% increase in fees AFTER what we've seen with Ordinal Inscriptions 12,800% increase in fees from BEFORE Ordinal Inscriptions launched 300,000 unconfirmed transactions in the mempool pic.twitter.com/oyLceu6ODe — trevor.btc @ NYC (@TO) May 2, 2023\n\n“Most of the acceleration is BRC-20,” Trevor Owens, Managing Partner at Bitcoin Frontier Fund, told Decrypt. The BRC-20 token standard made minting tokens and meme coins on the Bitcoin network possible, clearing the path for over 1 million more inscriptions to be added to the over 2.5 million already on the Bitcoin network in less than a week.\n\nIntroduced in March, BRC-20—or Bitcoin Request for Comment number 20—allowed the creation of fungible tokens using the Ordinals protocol launching a new wave of interest in minting NFT-like assets on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nBut while JPEGs are flooding the network, most inscriptions are still text-based.\n\n“Text inscriptions are lower cost since you pay based on the size of the data,” Owens said. “So they are low-cost high volume, whereas JPEGs and digital media is high cost, low volume.”\n\nCurrently, the memory usage on the Bitcoin network is over 650 MB, double the initial 300 MB capacity, indicating a higher demand for computer memory due to the increased transactions and fuller blocks, according to data from Mempool. This increase may make running a node more challenging, but Ordinals proponents say it secures and strengthens the network.\n\nStory continues\n\n“As long as the value gained from minting BRC-20 tokens is higher than the value lost to the inscription fees, we will see fees on Bitcoin continue to climb,” pseudonymous Twitter user @LeonidasNFT said, adding that higher fees on Bitcoin are a very good thing.\n\n“It indicates strong demand for Bitcoin’s block space, which is critical for the long-term success of the protocol,” Leonidas said. “The days of only using Bitcoin to transfer BTC to your hardware wallet once every few years have come to an end.”\n\nBitcoin NFT Mints Surpass 200K—But Is Interest in Ordinals Fading?\n\nHigh fees benefit the Bitcoin blockchain by incentivizing miners, prioritizing valuable transactions, and enhancing network security. However, while loading up the Bitcoin blockchain with JPEGs and sending fees skyrocketing may be good for miners and the network’s security, it puts a higher price tag on transactions on the network.\n\n“In February, we inscribed the Taproot Wizards collection, which took over 80MB of Bitcoin block space,” Taproot Wizards tweeted. “But now bitcoin transaction fees are so high, that if we tried inscribing the 80MB of wizards today, the fees would’ve cost us 32 BTC. Almost $1 million dollars.”\n\n“I think this is the best thing that could have happened to Bitcoin,” Owens said, pointing out that the launch and development of Ordinals did not require changing the Bitcoin base protocol. “We’ve unlocked new use cases to bring in liquidity, new users, and lots of developers making Bitcoin more valuable through better user experience and more use cases is what we need to reach mass adoption.”"}, {'id': 10, 'time': 'Tue, 02 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Can Bitcoin's Halving Events Point to a Future Cryptocurrency Market Rally? - Nasdaq", 'content': 'In a landscape as volatile as crypto, there are very few trends that investors can follow with any degree of certainty. Despite its erratic nature, one of the cryptocurrency ecosystem’s strongest trends has revolved around Bitcoin’s halving events every four years.\n\nThe coin went on to smash through its all-time high values in the months that followed its previous halving events, and now with the next one set for 2024, could investors expect a fresh rally?\n\nThere are many reasons for cryptocurrency market speculators to be excited for a prospective Bitcoin (BTC) halving event. The market dominance of BTC means that any price rallies for the world’s most famous crypto asset means that the entirety of the market is likely to experience a major bull run.\n\nAs Bitcoin’s stock-to-flow model (where stock is the total existing supply of a commodity—or a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin and flow is the new supply of the commodity or crypto that is created each year) shows, the cryptocurrency peaks at roughly the same stage in its halving cycle.\n\nShould this trend continue, we may see BTC surpass its most recent all-time high market values of November 2021 and soar to a considerably higher market price. But just how reliable is this metric? And what does a halving event actually involve? Let’s take a deeper look at Bitcoin’s halving cycles and what they actually mean for investors:\n\nWhat is a Bitcoin Halving Event?\n\nBitcoin undergoes a halving event approximately every four years. This sees the block rewards distributed to Bitcoin miners halve, hence its name.\n\nThis process will continue for many years until around the year 2140, when the total supply of BTC of 21 million is finally reached.\n\nBitcoin’s halving events are significant because they mark another drop in the rate of new Bitcoins being produced on the way to reaching its total supply. At present, the number of BTC in circulation stands at just over 19.3 million, indicating that there are fewer than 1.7 million left to mine.\n\nWhen Bitcoin was launched in 2009, the reward for each block mined was 50 BTC, but the first halving event in 2012 saw this supply halved to 25. Subsequently, the 2016 halving event saw rewards cut to 12.5, and finally 6.25 in the most recent halving event on May 11, 2020.\n\nHowever, as the chart shows, each halving event brought a fresh Bitcoin rally in its wake. Following Bitcoin’s 2016 halving, months of accumulation resulted in a new all-time high of $19,783.21 on December 17, 2017.\n\nIn the wake of the 2017 rally, Bitcoin and the wider market descended into a crypto winter until the 2020 halving event, which ultimately paved the way for a fresh all-time high of $69,044.77 in November 2021.\n\nSince its most recent peak, Bitcoin has descended into another crypto winter with harsh economic headwinds forcing the cryptocurrency to retrace at a significant rate. But should investors be optimistic for 2024’s next halving?\n\nWhile Bitcoin is often referred to as ‘digital gold,’ the notion of the supply of gold being halved every four years would lead to unimaginable price rises. Should demand for Bitcoin continue to grow, this would logically mean that Bitcoin would continue to become more scarce in the face of demand.\n\nIs Bitcoin Heading to the Moon?\n\nWhile there are certainly a number of caveats to keep in mind, there’s plenty of optimism that market commentators are drawing from Bitcoin’s halving events.\n\n“$180k; that’s the target,” stated Decentrader Crypto Analytics Founder ‘FilbFilb’ on Twitter. The user, who has amassed a following of more than 85,000 on Twitter, has based their calculations heavily on the Bitcoin halving event, which they believe will be a catalyst for a fresh all-time high for the cryptocurrency.\n\n“Bitcoin halving is due for March 2024. If history is anything to go off then you have 18 months absolute max…before we start doing all sorts of crazy stuff above the all-time high again,” FilbFilb added.\n\nThis sentiment has also been echoed by famous CryptoQuant Analyst ‘Plan B.’ As a user who frequently utilizes Bitcoin’s stock-to-flow model, Plan B took to Twitter to say that their metrics indicated a BTC value of over $32,000 at the time of Bitcoin’s 2024 halving event, and an eventual 2025 bull market which will see BTC reach values in excess of $100,000.\n\nGiven that Bitcoin hasn’t attained a value of more than $30,000 since June 2022, predictions of beyond $100k appear ambitious at first glance, but they’re shared across the crypto ecosystem.\n\n“If the block rewards get cut in half to 3.125 from 6.25, then the price has got to double-ish in order for the miners to continue to make money,” said Hedge Fund Manager Mark Yusko. “Traditional assets are driven by economic growth, Fed policies, inflation. Crypto is driven by the technology itself, millennial adoption,” Yusko added, noting that ‘the laws of math’ dictates that the upcoming halving event can push Bitcoin beyond $100,000.\n\nEmbracing a Changing Market\n\nIn cryptocurren...'}, {'id': 13, 'time': 'Tue, 02 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Why Is Bitcoin Going Back Up? - Nasdaq', 'content': 'Throughout 2022, the economy at large saw some turbulence. But the cryptocurrency market, in particular, experienced a downward slide from its epic heights in 2021. Even the oldest surviving cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, saw its value tumble from over $60,000 to under $17,000.\n\nInvestors interested in cryptocurrency couldn’t help but wonder when Bitcoin’s value would bounce back. That time seems to have finally come. Bitcoin saw its price surge 20% in March, leading many to wonder what changed. This article will explore why this reversal is happening and whether we think it will continue.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nCurrently trading around $28,000, Bitcoin has recovered almost $10,000 in value since its trough at the beginning of 2023.\n\nMany factors contributed to the falling price of Bitcoin, including generally adverse economic conditions.\n\nWith some of the factors that pushed the price down now reversed, the value of Bitcoin is rising. Only time will tell if the trend continues.\n\nA Short History of Bitcoin\n\nWhen Bitcoin hit the market in 2009, it was unclear what to expect from an investment perspective. However, that didn’t stop investors who understood the cryptocurrency’s potential from jumping in.\n\nIn July 2010, Bitcoin saw its first big jump in price to $0.09. But the inherent volatility of cryptocurrency led to significant swings along the way. When we fast forward to 2020, Bitcoin started climbing to an all-time high of $67,566 in November 2021.\n\nOf course, this extreme spike in value had many investors excited. After all, who wouldn’t want to add such a high-performing asset to their portfolio? Unfortunately for some investors, jumping on the Bitcoin bandwagon in 2021 would become a big mistake.\n\nBitcoin in 2022\n\nSince that peak of roughly $68,000, Bitcoin has taken a tumble. In mid-November 2022, the cryptocurrency’s value fell to around $16,700. That meant Bitcoin had lost over 70% of its value from a year before.\n\nBitcoin prices seemed bleak in 2022 compared to the previous year’s highs. But compared to prices from 2019, the asset had still increased in value even at its end-of-2022 low point.\n\nWhat Pushed Bitcoin Down?\n\nAlthough Bitcoin’s value experienced such a dramatic tumble in 2022, many seasoned crypto investors were used to the extreme volatility of this asset class. And the reality is that Bitcoin was not the only asset to see shocking volatility amidst 2022’s market conditions.\n\nIf you’re not someone who keeps tabs on the general economy, 2022 was a wild ride. Many factors hurting stock investors and everyday households also contributed to the volatility in the crypto market.\n\nOne of the major issues facing the economy was high levels of inflation. Inflation is typically caused by a mismatch of supply and demand. Companies will raise prices if demand for goods is unusually high or something interrupts supply chains. When an increase in prices is widespread across the economy, the Federal Reserve steps in.\n\nThe Federal Reserve approved a series of aggressive rate hikes across 2022 to curb inflation. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive and reduce consumers’ discretionary spending. People save more and often sell off investments, anticipating poor performance from companies.\n\nCryptocurrency suffered plenty of bad press in 2022 due to the fallout of FTX. The collapse of the crypto exchange led to a loss of over $1 billion in consumer funds. Whenever a failure like this happens, crypto markets tend to suffer as investors are increasingly skeptical of the asset’s stability.\n\nThe war between Ukraine and Russia also strained the global political world in 2022. Plus, mid-term elections kept the U.S. political landscape uneasy. These factors contributed to the financial turmoil we saw, which likely caused the negative slide in Bitcoin’s price.\n\nHowever, historically, there has been an underlying debate about the inherent value of Bitcoin. Some investors are wary of using Bitcoin as a long-term store of value, while others are more confident that another coin, like Ethereum, might surpass Bitcoin’s usefulness at some point.\n\nThe Value of Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency representing an alternative to “normal” fiat currency. A central bank controls fiat money, and it has value because the government decrees it has value. Consumers widely use it, and its value isn’t tied to a specific commodity, like the gold standard.\n\nDespite being located in a digital space, it’s important to remember that Bitcoins are limited in their supply and have an associated cost of production. Some people compare Bitcoins to precious metals because of their limited economic use. For example, you can’t use Bitcoin or physical gold to pay at most retail stores.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin does have certain advantages over other currencies. Bitcoin is more mobile than paper money or precious metals because it’s not physical. Bitcoin’s underlying technology is decentralized and validated by various independent nodes. This make...'}]

That pause has been accompanied by thinning volumes, with small trades increasingly able to move market prices.\n\n“While bitcoin’s recent performance is great on the face of it, many in crypto are calling this year an unloved rally,” said Charles Storry, head of growth at Phuture, a crypto index provider.\n\n“Sentiment hasn’t changed, and regulatory scrutiny is sidelining a lot of new money that might otherwise enter the space. Price movements don’t mean much if the industry isn’t making meaningful progress to regain trust and attract new investors,” he added.\n\nA bruising 2022 has left investors nursing losses or funds trapped in limbo as failed cryptocurrency lenders and exchanges go through bankruptcy proceedings in the courts.\n\nCrypto enthusiasts also argued confidence has been renewed by the weakness in the global banking sector, and the vast outflow of deposits from banks such as the US’s Silicon Valley Bank and Silvergate, and Credit Suisse in Switzerland.\n\nDigital assets dashboard Click here for real-time data on crypto prices and insights\n\n“That rally we experienced after the banking crisis earlier this year seemed to be directly related to a flight for safety and self-custody of funds away from the dollar,” said Edmond Goh, head of trading at crypto broker B2C2.\n\nBut that sentiment has been undermined by a host of signals coming from crypto markets. Analysts point out that the rally in cryptocurrency prices was already built on a thinly traded market.\n\nThe degree to which a market can absorb large orders without major changes to the price of bitcoin has declined since the start of the year, according to data provider CCData.\n\nIn January it would have required the purchase of more than 1,400 bitcoins, roughly equivalent to $23mn at the time, to move the price of the token by more than 1 per cent of its prevailing market value, CCData said.\n\nTowards the end of last month it would have taken only 462 bitcoins, worth about $13mn, to move market prices by 1 per cent, the lowest point of market depth for the bitcoin-tether trading pair since May 2022, when the industry plunged into crisis.\n\n“Prices are recovering, but liquidity has yet to return. No exchange or market maker has yet to fill the space that FTX and [its sister trading arm] Alameda once encompassed,” said Michael Safai, managing partner at crypto trading firm Dexterity Capital.\n\nInvestors who have bought into bitcoin in recent months are now holding on to their investments.\n\nGlassnode, a crypto data provider, said “there has been remarkably little expenditure” by investors who bought bitcoin when it hit a two-year low after FTX’s failure last November.\n\n“The ‘FOMO’ that drove a lot of first time institutional and retail investors last year is obviously not happening now, despite the fact the crypto markets have rallied significantly this year,” said one crypto fund manager based in Dubai, referring to a fear of missing out.\n\nMoreover, there have been outflows of $72mn over the last two weeks in digital asset investments, ending a six-week run of consecutive inflows, according to CoinShares. The crypto investment group ascribed the trend to the likeliness of further interest rate increases by the US Federal Reserve.\n\nTraders are also worried that the heavy clouds that have overshadowed the industry for the past 12 months have not fully gone away. Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, is likely to be pulled into a drawn-out lawsuit with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nAnother cloud is the fate of Genesis, one of the biggest lenders in the crypto market, which filed for bankruptcy in January owing more than $3bn after the implosion of FTX.\n\nOwner Digital Currency Group, one of the world’s largest owner of bitcoins via its asset management arm, is looking to raise funds to pay back Genesis creditors. DCG said last week some Genesis creditors had walked away from a previously agreed restructuring deal.\n\nThe market appears to be “in a holding pattern pending the resolution of DCG’s debt payments”, said Ram Ahluwalia, chief executive of inves...'}, {'id': 26, 'time': 'Wed, 03 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'CleanSpark Releases April 2023 Bitcoin Mining Update - Yahoo Finance', 'content': 'Company mined 524 bitcoin in April; Increased bitcoin holdings 60% to 313\n\nLAS VEGAS, May 03, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CleanSpark, Inc. (Nasdaq: CLSK), America’s Bitcoin Miner™, today released its unaudited bitcoin mining and operations update for the month ending April 30, 2023.\n\n"Our high efficiency measures and low power rates have made meaningful contributions to our margins this month even as difficulty has substantially increased,” said Zach Bradford, CEO. “The result of these efforts is that while we have mined fewer bitcoin this month, the bitcoin we have mined is being driven to our bottom line. As we look to the next few months, we expect Washington to be fully energized, which will bump our hashrate as we maintain our competitive edge in these tight market conditions.

We expect to maintain that edge as the pace of deliveries for the newly released S19J Pro+ machines ramp up and are installed at our Sandersville and Washington facilities.

"Before that, we were seeing traditional fund managers looking to launch crypto funds, ETPs in Europe, which is the equivalent of ETFs in the U.S. — that\'s really gone quiet. Even the hedge funds, who are pretty active in the markets, have certainly reduced their exposure within that particular space."\n\nMeanwhile, leaders from the biggest financial institutions gathered at the San Francisco conference were energized when it came to the blockchain technology – specifically its potential to help tokenize real-world assets like gold for clients.\n\nThe "evolution of the technology" is moving into a "better place" in terms of support from market participants, Chapman said.\n\n"As a firm, we have capabilities that sit there to administer [crypto trading] functions, but it\'s a pretty quiet market at the moment and [after] most of the issues we had last year, we haven\'t seen a rebound at all on the institutional side yet," he said.\n\nSpecifically, Northern Trust partnered with Standard Chartered in 2020 to launch Zodia, a crypto custodian for institutional investors.\n\nBitcoin has gained almost 75% this year after losing 64% in 2022. Trading was still to begin the year, with volatility falling to historic lows. The regulatory crackdown in the U.S. been a dark cloud over the industry while the banking crisis has helped push bitcoin\'s price higher. Both have brought volatility back to the market. Even as bitcoin currently struggles to break above the $30,000 level, investors agree it remains in a long-term uptrend.\n\n"We\'re not focused that much on the asset class because the client isn\'t at the moment," Chapman said. "So we\'re not seeing that appetite to have that within their portfolios. If that changes, as a firm, we can account for those capabilities. But it\'s certainly lost its shine from the institutional perspective."'}, {'id': 44, 'time': 'Thu, 04 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Bitcoin's Frenzy of Activity Pushes Average Transaction Fee Over $7, Nearly 2-Year High - Yahoo Finance", 'content': 'A spike in transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain involving Ethereum-style tokens and non-fungible token (NFT)-like “inscriptions” has driven up congestion on the network, pushing the average fee rate to the highest in nearly two years while showering miners of the cryptocurrency with extra revenue.\n\nOn Wednesday, the average fee per Bitcoin transaction rose to $7.25, the highest since July 2021. For comparison, the rate so far this year had fluctuated between roughly 50 cents and $4, data from BitInfoCharts shows.\n\nWith transaction activity also surging, total fees on Bitcoin have also jumped.\n\nPer blockchain analytics firm Glassnode, Bitcoin’s total transaction fees, which are paid by users to miners, jumped to around 124 BTC or roughly $3.5 million, on May 3, representing a 484% increase in the past 14 days.\n\n“This current fee spree is an anomaly,” wrote Colin Harper, head of content at Luxor Technologies, a full-stack Bitcoin mining pool.\n\nBitcoin: Total Transaction Fees (Glassnode)\n\nIn recent days, a token type called BRC-20 (a play on Ethereum’s ERC-20 token standard), which facilitates the issue and transfer of fungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain, has accounted for about 6% of all Bitcoin activity since its inception in early March, according to pseudonymous analyst and yield farmer Dynamo DeFi. This year has also seen the rise of Ordinals inscriptions, which are similar to NFTs and could be images or text strings inscribed into Bitcoin-based transactions. Both activities require transaction fees.\n\n“Inscriptions are the primary driver here,” said Harper. “Biggest difference now between this jump in transaction fees and past ones with inscriptions is that BRC-20 standard is a new way to inscribe. Adoption of this standard is driving fees up.”\n\n“The increase in transaction volume of that token standard has driven up demand for Bitcoin blockspace,” said Jimmy Zhang, who works in the business operations and strategy department at blockchain data firm Artemis.\n\nKydo, vice president of Stanford Blockchain Club, told CoinDesk via direct messages on Telegram that "Blockspace is the core commodity on any blockchain. People have found a new use case and the usage skyrocketed. BTC is more than money now." Kydo said they only use the one name publicly because of privacy concerns.\n\nStory continues\n\nMiners who secure and maintain the Bitcoin network are beneficiaries of the recent increase in BTC transaction fees because they are rewarded in BTC fees for processing users’ transactions.\n\nHarper predicts the increased transaction fees currently occurring in the ecosystem are “a temporary phenomenon, though, and that transaction fees will revert back to a manageable mean soon.”\n\nKydo said they think the current phenomenon will last a while, "given how much people like NFTs."\n\nThe price of BTC has increased 1.2% in the past 24 hours to $28,884, at press time. The average transaction fee on Bitcoin is $7.25. According to data website cryptofees.info, Bitcoin’s seven-day average fee stands at roughly $2 million, second only behind Ethereum’s $12.5 million.

A third-generation investor, Draper was an early backer of some of the most pivotal technology to come out of California, from Hotmail to Skype. In recent years, his focus has been on Bitcoin and the broader ethos of decentralization, famously paying $19 million for 30,000 Bitcoin in 2014 that had been seized in the U.S. government takedown of dark web marketplace Silk Road.\n\nMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from home Looking to make extra cash?

In an interview with Fortune, Draper said he expects Bitcoin to soar in value amid economic uncertainty in the U.S.\n\n“If the bear gets that angry to where the banks start falling apart, that actually means that Bitcoin will have a bull market,” he told Fortune. “It’ll be a raging bull in the middle of the bear.”\n\nBitcoin is currently sitting at just under $29,000. It’s up nearly 75% since the beginning of 2023 amid the failures of major U.S. banks Signature, Silicon Valley Bank, and First Republic.\n\nDraper’s support of Bitcoin does not extend to the entire crypto ecosystem. While he backed pioneering projects like the blockchain Tezos, he said he’s wary of companies that are too centralized. Draper said he twice turned down an investment opportunity in Sam Bankman-Fried’s now-failed exchange FTX, arguing that there was no utility for its proprietary token, FTT, except for speculation.\n\nAs FTX rose in popularity in 2021 and 2022, Draper said he thought he had missed something, but was vindicated in November when the company collapsed in spectacular fashion.\n\nStory continues\n\n“I just thought it was a race to the bottom,” Draper said about CeFi, or centralized finance, companies like FTX.\n\nHis concern now is with crypto regulation, as lawmakers debate legislation to establish guardrails for the industry and agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission target firms with enforcement actions. Draper said that when he speaks with startups in the space, they ask him about regulation, which had never before been the case.\n\n“If they’re regulating by enforcement, they’re just slapping people down and fining them and suing them,” he told Fortune. “I don’t want to waste years of my life in court and trying to avoid some problem.”\n\nDraper, who has advocated for breaking up California into six states, said that the only solution is to have a new political party in charge.\n\n“This is as controlling as the U.S. government has ever been,” he said. “They’re ruining business, they’re killing the golden goose, and Silicon Valley is breaking up because of it.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nMore from Fortune:\n\n5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from home\n\nLooking to make extra cash?

To skip the detailed analysis and recent updates about the cryptocurrency industry, go directly to the 5 Best Bitcoin Stocks to Invest in According to Hedge Funds.\n\nBitcoin was launched in 2009 and since then it has had the most volatile movements among all asset classes. If we look at Bitcoin’s price history, its shows some interesting trends. In 2010, Bitcoin was worth $0.9 and reached $26.9 in 2011. Over the years, it showed high volatility. In May 2017, Bitcoin was worth $2000 and reached over $19,000 in December of the same year.\n\nDuring these ups and downs, the brightest year for Bitcoin was noted in 2021 as we reported previously that the cryptocurrency had reached its peak at $69,000. Later in 2022, cryptocurrency experienced one of its biggest disasters known as the “crypto winter” mainly due to the cryptocurrency exchange, FTX’s scandal, combined with Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes due to rising inflation. It was estimated that Bitcoin would close out in 2022 at $16,800. The cryptocurrency traded at even less than the estimated amount at around $16,530 on December 31, 2022.\n\nThe FTX scandal was revealed when the digital currency news website, CoinDesk published an article stating that the FTX’s sister firm Alameda Research’s balance sheet was full of FTT tokens. It was later found that the capital provided by FTX to Alameda Research were customer deposits. This led Binance to sell all of its FTT tokens leading to a crash in its price which would later lead to a plethora of withdrawals from the exchange, creating a severe shortage of liquidity in the firm, thus leading to its bankruptcy.\n\nFTX’s CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was later arrested and his bail bond was set at $250 million which is the largest one in history. The FTX collapse spread shockwaves among the industry and shepherded two major banks toward their collapse and a third one barely getting by and is currently being investigated by the US Department of Justice for accounts connected to Bankman-Fried\'s businesses.\n\nStory continues\n\nCryptocurrency Outlook\n\nDespite facing a rough year in 2022, Bitcoin made a major comeback as it is up by 86.86% at the time of writing from its November lows and trading at $29,444, marking its highest price since June 2022. Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest predicted that the cryptocurrency’s price may reach $1 million in 2023. The director of institutional sales at Paradigm believes that this is just the beginning of the rally for Bitcoin. He wrote:\n\n"Now we\'ve seen rates start to fall sharply, with the market pricing in rate cuts in the second half of the year. The Fed and ECB balance sheets are also back in expansion mode. This is the bullish thesis but on steroids." In addition, Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, said about cryptocurrencies:\n\n"2023 will be a transition year from the vicious, frigid crypto winter of 2022 into something hopefully a lot hotter in 2024."\n\nMoreover, cryptocurrency stocks have also rallied significantly as cryptocurrency exchange platform, Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) has been up by around 60% year to date as of April 30, and cryptocurrency mining company Riot Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIOT) is up over 250% year to date.

While observers are unsure about short-term moves, the consensus remains that Bitcoin’s upside mainly lies ahead as the block subsidy halving approaches.\n\nWhen tracking what comes next, however, it may be enough to look at past halving cycles, specifically, volatility.\n\nAs Titan of Crypto notes, Bollinger Bands on monthly timeframes are setting up a repeat of a breakout event that has occurred only once in each cycle.\n\nIn the two previous instances shown on an accompanying chart from 2016 and 2019, BTC/USD broke through into the upper section of the Bollinger Band channel to see significant gains.\n\nBollinger Bands are a key volatility indicator across price timeframes. They revolve around a 20-period simple moving average (SMA) functioning as a midline, with two standard deviations above and below representing the channel.\n\nThese bands expand and contract with volatility and certain events: among them, the price coming into contact with the bands or even breaking beyond them is often considered important by traders.\n\nCurrently, the one-month BTC/USD chart shows the price attempting to break above the SMA line, which, if confirmed, would suggest a classic repeat of past bull runs.\n\nCommenting, Titan of Crypto described it as an “inexorable breakout.“\n\n”BTC is about to break its monthly Bollinger Bands base line. And when that happens 1st target will follow inexorably,” he added.\n\n“That would bring Bitcoin to a solid $63,500.”\n\nBTC/USD annotated chart. Source: Titan of Crypto/ Twitter\n\nWhile not quite enough to match its current all-time high, the price target could come around the point of the halving in one year’s time. How long it will need in reality remains to be seen, Titan of Crypto acknowledged.\n\nBTC price bides its time\n\nLast month, John Bollinger, the band’s creator, himself argued that Bitcoin was at a crucial point on daily timeframes.\n\nRelated: Is Bitcoin overbought or oversold? Use Bollinger Bands to find out!\n\nAt the time, the price was retesting the SMA line as support, breaking through to range around it. Now, however, it is heading higher toward the upper band, data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows.\n\nBTC/USD 1-day candle chart (Bitstamp) with Bollinger bands.

This is the first time since February that the difficulty, which controls the issuance of coins on the network, has decreased. Recent data from Braiins showed that Bitcoin computing power experienced a drop of over 45+ EH/s between April 20 and 28. However, this trend has been reversed with the increase in miner profits over the last week.\n\nDespite the recovery of the hashrate to 350 EH/s, it was not sufficient to prevent a 1.45% difficulty adjustment retracement, as stated by Mempool.space. Currently, the mining difficulty level is at 48T (trillions). This change in difficulty level affects the miners’ profitability, as less competition for the reward means increased estimated income for those still connected to the network.\n\nBitcoin Miners Profit As Hashprice Increases\n\nThe current price for Bitcoin hashpower rose to 0.088 USD/TH/day (88 USD/PH/day), up from 0.077 USD/TH/day (77 USD/PH/day) on May 2. This 11.49% increase over three days is a positive development for Bitcoin miners, indicating increased profitability for their operations. The hashprice is a crucial metric for calculating the profitability of a mining operation, representing the value assigned to a unit of computation in dollars per terahash or petahash per day. While the cause of the significant hashrate drop last week is uncertain, the current state of the network justifies the quick reconnection of miners.\n\nRecently, there has been increased interest in BRC-20 tokens, which are used to create memecoins, leading to network congestion in Bitcoin within a few days of their release. As recently reported, this could be a possible factor in the hashrate drop. As a result of this high activity on the network, the fees are now making up 12.4% of the miners’ revenue.\n\nRelated Reading: Bitcoin Breaks Out: Experts Predict $36,000 Target As Market Outlook Remains Positive\n\nBitcoin Commissions Rise After New Ordinals Record\n\nIn the wake of the rising interest in tokens that can be registered to Bitcoin through Ordinals, the value of transaction fees paid by Bitcoin users has surged. Within a single day, the average transaction fees have more than doubled. As per the data from Mempool.space, the current transaction fees range from 70 sat/vB to 100 sat/vB. This implies that a transaction of 140 vB (median) would require payment of almost $4 USD to get confirmed within the first few minutes.\n\nNote that the sudden interest in tokens registered through Ordinals is responsible for the backlog of transactions that need confirmation, leading to a surge in average commissions. According to Murch, a Bitcoin developer, the mempool depth has reached 104 blocks despite having 8 blocks per hour for the last six hours. The rise of Ordinals NFTs has not been without controversy, as some Bitcoin maximalists blame this trend for the increased transaction fees that have resurfaced in recent months.\n\nRelated Reading: Former DoJ Kennedy Jr, Laments on Global Financial Censorship, Shows Support For Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin Price Analysis\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $29,000, up 2% in the last week.\n\nFeatured Image from iStock.com, charts from Braain.com, Mempool.space and Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Knowing where to place your bets can be challenging with so many options.\n\nHowever, after careful analysis, experts agree that Sparklo (SPRK) is the clear winner regarding potential return on investment. With potential growth up to 4,000 times, it’s no wonder investors are flocking to Sparklo.\n\nSparklo Presale Momentum On The Rise As Bulls Take Control\n\nIt’s hard not to be intrigued by Sparklo (SPRK)’s incredible momentum. Though still in its presale, demand for this cryptocurrency is going through the roof. And it’s easy to see why. On May 4th, the price of Sparklo (SPRK) increased by two cents with a current price of $0.019.\n\nThat’s a significant jump! No wonder investors are rushing in before the second stage of the Sparklo (SPRK) presale. But what’s so special about Sparklo (SPRK)? Well, its use case is simply fascinating.\n\nThrough its clever fractionalization of ownership, Sparklo (SPRK) lets you own a piece of valuable metals like gold, platinum, and silver. And transparency? Sparklo (SPRK) has that in spades.\n\nWith Sparklo’s (SPRK) smart contract being audited by InterFi and locked in a 100-year liquidity lock, you can trust Sparklo’s (SPRK) transparency practices. If Sparklo (SPRK)’s momentum keeps up, some analysts predict it could do 4,000x.\n\nThat’s something worth watching and perfect to include in a portfolio that includes both Dash (DASH) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH).\n\n>>>> BUY SPARKLO TOKENS <<<\n\nDash Coin (DASH) Bearish As Investors Seek Better Returns Elsewhere\n\nDash (DASH) has been making waves in the crypto world due to its impressive use cases and widespread adoption. Its ability to facilitate private transactions at low fees has made it a highly sought-after crypto for everyday use.\n\nAdopted heavily in South America, Dash (DASH) has a strong foundation that has allowed it to remain in the upper echelon of cryptos. However, with its market cap already being substantial, analysts predict it may underperform the market.\n\nAs new crypto options emerge, analysts are looking towards up-and-coming options like Sparklo (SPRK) to outperform Dash (DASH) soon.\n\nNevertheless, Dash (DASH) remains a powerhouse in the world of cryptocurrencies, with its many benefits making it a top choice for crypto enthusiasts. Dash (DASH) adoption rate means it will remain one of the safest cryptos.\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) Growth Prospects As An Investment Weak\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) is one of the most used cryptos today for business transactions. Many retailers and businesses that accept crypto do accept Bitcoin Cash (BCH). This gives Bitcoin Cash (BCH) an edge over many other cryptos.\n\nThat being said, analysts are not bullish on Bitcoin Cash (BCH), giving investors a return that they can’t get from any other crypto.\n\nOn the bright side, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) can diversify. While Bitcoin Cash (BCH)’s large market cap suggests a limited potential for exponential growth, plenty of smaller cryptocurrencies – like Sparklo (SPRK) – offer an opportunity for significant gains.\n\nA crypto like Sparklo (SPRK) is in so high demand that some analysts expect it to do 4,000X.

It\'s meant to cut the supply of tokens and historically has sparked price increases.\n\n"When bitcoin\'s halving kicks in a year from now, we\'ll likely be well on our way past the previous all-time high," Ras told Insider.\n\nThat would mean bitcoin soars past the $67,000 level reached in November 2021, up from about $29,000 on Friday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, bitcoin appears to be front-running the belief that looser policy from the Federal Reserve is on the way, Ras explained.\n\nThe Fed on Wednesday hiked rates for the 10th consecutive time, but Wall Street widely expects that to be the last increase of this tightening cycle.\n\nHe thinks the token\'s rally points to a future that is effectively a return to lower rates and more quantitative easing.\n\nTechnical indicators, such as long-term moving averages, suggest upside and momentum, he said, but it\'s the broader landscape that will determine its performance the rest of the year. And he wouldn\'t be surprised if bitcoin hits $40,000 by the end of 2023.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n"Coupled with signs of slowing [economic] growth, the changing macro picture is pointing towards a Fed that will likely soon have to cut interest rates and inject a lot of liquidity into the market," Ras said. "If the Fed doesn\'t do this, then we could face a serious contraction, punctuated by a possible credit crunch. Either way, all roads appear to be leading to a loosening of monetary policy sooner rather than later."\n\nRas isn\'t alone in his bullishness. Standard Chartered published a recent note that said bitcoin could soar to $100,000 by the middle of next year, and Matrixport predicted that bitcoin could more than double to about $65,000 by next April.\n\nA hedge against financial turmoil\n\nAs the banking crisis that started with Silicon Valley Bank in March continues to spark contagion fears, more retail and institutional investors have been turning to bitcoin as a hedge, Ras said.\n\nThat turmoil re-emerged over the past week as regulators seized First Republic on Monday and sold the bulk of its assets to JPMorgan, triggered sell-offs at regional banks PacWest Bancorp and Western Alliance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n"The banking crisis helped to cement the narrative of bitcoin serving as a key store of value that lacks the sort of counterparty risk of holding funds by way of bank deposits," Ras said. "Bitcoin offers protection by way of decentralization, self-custody and a network that has never been hacked."\n\nBut a credit crisis poses the biggest downside risk for bitcoin, he said. In such a scenario, bitcoin as well as gold, another traditional safe-haven investment, could see a sharp decline in value.\n\n"I\'m not sure such a scenario would happen," Ras said, "but it\'s possible and would unleash a tremendous amount of volatility, not only for bitcoin but all markets."'}, {'id': 4, 'time': 'Sat, 06 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Why Bitcoin Mixers Are a Double-Edged Sword for Anti-Money Laundering Efforts - Brave New Coin Insights', 'content': 'Why Bitcoin Mixers Are a Double-Edged Sword for Anti-Money Laundering Efforts\n\nAlthough bitcoin mixers are frequently targeted by financial regulators in relation to anti-money laundering efforts, they are also used for a range of legitimate purposes such as protecting financial privacy and avoiding nefarious transaction monitoring.\n\nBitcoin has become one of the world’s most popular forms of payment due to its convenience, speed, and low transaction fees. However, as more and more people use bitcoin for everyday transactions, privacy concerns have arisen. Bitcoin transactions are pseudo-anonymous, meaning that while transactions are recorded on a public blockchain, the identities of the sender and recipient are not necessarily known. This anonymity has made bitcoin a popular choice for those who value their privacy. However, the pseudo-anonymity of bitcoin has also made it attractive to criminals who use it for illegal activities such as money laundering. Since on-chain analytics companies can easily trace any blockchain transaction, more and more crypto users prefer coin-anonymizing services such as bitcoin mixers or bitcoin tumblers.\n\nBitcoin mixers have become a popular tool for those who want to keep their financial transactions private. While the concept of bitcoin mixers may seem innocent enough, they have become a double-edged sword in the fight against money laundering. According to a report by Chainalysis, a blockchain analytics company, the total value of bitcoin transferred through mixers increased from $11 million in 2022 to $67 million in 2023. This represents an increase of 500% in just one year. In this article, we will explore why bitcoin mixers are problematic for anti-money laundering efforts and how they can be used in a positive way.\n\nThe Dark Side of Bitcoin Mixers\n\nBitcoin mixers are online services that allow users to mix their bitcoins with other users’ bitcoins. This process is also known as bitcoin mixing or bitcoin tumbling. The idea behind bitcoin mixing is to make it difficult for anyone to trace a bitcoin transaction back to its original owner.\n\nThis anonymity is a major problem for anti-money laundering efforts. Criminals can use bitcoin mixers to launder money by mixing their illegally obtained bitcoins with legitimate ones. The process of mixing makes it almost impossible to trace the illegal bitcoins back to their original source.\n\nAccording to a report by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental organization that develops anti-money laundering guidelines, bitcoin mixers are one of the biggest threats to anti-money laundering efforts in the cryptocurrency space. The report states that mixers are mostly used by criminals to launder money and avoid detection by law enforcement. Although cryptocurrencies are often singled out by politicians and enforcement agencies when discussing money laundering, the reality is that crypto-related money laundering is a drop in the bucket compared to the global money laundering total.\n\nFor example, in 2021 Chainalysis estimated around US$9 billion was laundered using cryptocurrencies. In the same time period, the United Nations office on Drugs and Crime estimated total global money laundering to be at least $800 billion annually – and potentially up to $2 trillion. Even more surprising is the number of respected international banks that were fined in 2021 in relation to breaches of anti-money laundering laws and regulations.\n\nThe Positive Side of Bitcoin Mixers\n\nWhile bitcoin mixers are problematic for anti-money laundering efforts, they are also used for legitimate purposes. Many people use bitcoin mixers to protect their financial privacy and avoid potential transaction monitoring. For example, when someone buys something online using bitcoin, they may not want the seller to know their identity. By using a bitcoin mixer, they can ensure that their transaction is anonymous and cannot be traced back to them. Bitcoin mixing can help protect them from potential fraud or identity theft.\n\nBitcoin mixers are also often used by businesses to protect their financial information from competitors. If a company is making a large transaction, it may not want its competitors to know how much money it is moving. By using a bitcoin mixer, they can ensure that their transaction is private and cannot be traced back to them.\n\nAnother reason for seeking transaction privacy is political persecution. Of 205 countries and territories surveyed by Freedom House recently, in terms of their political rights and civil liberties, the NGO found 125 to be either ‘not free’ or only ‘partly free’. Political movements are costly to organise, and cutting of access to funding is a common tactic of oppressive governments.\n\nIn terms of personal security, bitcoin mixers can be used by law-abiding citizens to protect themselves from hacking and theft. By mixing their bitcoins with others, users can disguise the origin of their funds, making it more difficult ...'}]

The news articles suggest a mixed sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin and Ether falling in value due to failed resistance levels and potential downward pressure from proposed cryptocurrency mining taxes. Additionally, concerns about transaction fees and congestion in the Bitcoin network due to ordinals inscription are highlighted. However, there are positive developments in the adoption of Polkadot blockchain in traditional finance.

REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the ETH market is showing positive signs with fluctuating open prices, increasing total value transferred and transactions, and a bullish MACD signal. The stable unique addresses and coinbase transactions also indicate consistent interest in ETH. 

On the other hand, the news analyst report suggests a mixed sentiment in the overall cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin experiencing positive growth driven by new token standards and billionaire investor predictions. However, institutional interest in crypto assets has decreased, focusing more on blockchain technology.

Reflecting on the reports, it is clear that a moderately conservative approach focusing on long-term strategies, risk management, and staying informed on market trends has been effective in maximizing profitability. While the news reports highlight potential challenges, the on-chain analyst reports and technical indicators point towards a positive market trend for ETH.

Therefore, the clear market trend for ETH appears to be positive in the long term, with potential for further growth. It is important to prioritize information from on-chain analyst reports and technical indicators over news reports to make informed trading decisions.

Transaction fees in the block clocked in at 6.7 Bitcoin, beating the block subsidy of 6.25 Bitcoin.\n\nThough this spike in fees has thrown a curveball to users, this block shows how it\'s benefitting Bitcoin miners, the global network of volunteers that run expensive, specialized computers to secure the Bitcoin network. They’re the ones raking in this newfound treasure trove of fees.\n\nBREAKING: #Bitcoin block 788695 contained transaction fees greater than the block subsidy. 6.7 BTC transaction fees + 6.25 BTC subsidy This is a the first time in history this has ever occurred due to competitively high block space demand. pic.twitter.com/J7IcwzIVKE — Joe Burnett (🔑)³ (@IIICapital) May 7, 2023\n\nBitcoin miners have two sources of income built in for them. One is the block subsidy. Roughly every 10 minutes, miners are awarded 6.25 Bitcoin. This value is split in half every four years in an event known as the Bitcoin “halvening.”\n\nThe second source is transaction fees. Users optionally can tag on a fee to every Bitcoin transaction. If there\'s more demand for Bitcoin, users need to hike their fee if they want it to get through in a timely manner. There\'s been lots of demand recently, pushing the average fee up to $19 according to cryptocurrency statistics website BitInfoCharts.\n\nAs such, the transaction fee source of income fluctuates somewhat erratically with demand.\n\n\'Attack on Bitcoin’ Claims Circulate as Transaction Fees Climb Higher\n\nOne reason bitcoiners find this surplus in fees so monumental is that eventually — in more than a hundred years — transaction fees will be miners\' sole source of income. But transaction fees fluctuate so often, it hasn’t yet been proven that it will provide a consistent source of income when that time finally rolls around.\n\nMiners are the glue holding Bitcoin together. The more hashing power provided by miners securing Bitcoin, the more secure Bitcoin is. But miners are unlikely to secure the network if they aren’t paid to do it. Therefore it could be bad for Bitcoin if transaction fees don’t increase over the years.\n\nBlock 788695 is a small, optimistic sign that fees could increase, even if it hasn\'t proved a consistent form of income for miners just yet. As self-custody platform Casa CTO Jameson Lopp put it on Twitter: "The model for thermodynamic security has been proven possible. The only remaining question is if this demand is sustainable."'}, {'id': 2, 'time': 'Mon, 08 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Bitcoin slides after network congestion leads Binance to briefly halt withdrawals - CNBC', 'content': '"Only a break back below $25,000 would give reason for concern. Until then, we suspect dips will continue to be very well supported," he added.\n\n"Reports of a large bitcoin outflow and withdrawals being paused at a major exchange could be factoring into some of the weakness we\'re seeing. Ultimately however, there haven\'t been any major developments as far as price action goes, with bitcoin still very much confined to a multiday bullish consolidation," said Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX Group.\n\nThe price of bitcoin was lower by 5.3% at $27,420.73, according to Coin Metrics. It has fallen 7% since Saturday. Ether fell 4.3% on Monday to $1,833.72.\n\nBitcoin fell to start the week, extending losses from a sharp drop over the weekend following reports by one of the biggest crypto exchanges in the world about "congestion" on the Bitcoin network.\n\nMonday\'s drop came after Binance tweeted Sunday that the Bitcoin network was "experiencing a congestion issue" and that it was temporarily closing bitcoin withdrawals as a result until the network stabilized. Some market participants have argued that the Bitcoin network is stable and Binance should have prepared for a high-fee environment on Bitcoin.\n\nThe issue has highlighted a long-known setback of the Bitcoin network: It wasn\'t designed to handle a large number of transactions at scale. It processes just seven to 10 transactions per second, making it unviable as a potential rival to companies such as Visa and Mastercard — an idea many have explored over the years but largely put to rest. This is why projects such as the Lightning Network, which helps speed up transactions without affecting the network, have gained in popularity.\n\nService on Binance resumed, but later on Sunday evening the exchange again halted withdrawals.\n\n"To prevent a similar recurrence in the future, our fees have been adjusted," the Binance account tweeted. "We will continue to monitor on-chain activity and adjust accordingly if needed. Our team has also been working on enabling BTC Lightning Network withdrawals, which will help in such situations."\n\nA \'parabolic spike\'\n\nAlex Thorn, head of firmwide research at Galaxy, noted a "parabolic spike" in transaction fees on the Bitcoin network last week, attributing it to users minting BRC-20 tokens. These are an experimental token on the Bitcoin blockchain that ultimately allow users to create NFTs on Bitcoin. They\'re inspired by Ethereum\'s ERC-20 token.\n\nOn May 1, about 50% of bitcoin transactions were BRC-20 mints, Thorn highlighted in a note Friday. In the 14 days preceding Friday, mean transaction fees on Bitcoin increased 297%.\n\n"There is an increasing demand for BRC-20 tokens which include transferring digital collectibles on Bitcoin network," said Oppenheimer analyst Owen Lau. "The Bitcoin network has gradually supported more different types of tokens like NFTs. This adoption should be a positive sign longer term but it looks like it has slowed down the network."'}, {'id': 4, 'time': 'Mon, 08 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': '3 Crypto Stocks to Buy Before Bitcoin Hits $100,000 - Yahoo Finance', 'content': 'Last month, Standard Chartered released a report that Bitcoin (BTC-USD) can hit $100,000 by the end of 2024. The target seems steep, but cryptocurrencies have a history of skyrocketing in the blink of an eye.\n\nStandard Chartered cites stress in the traditional banking system as one of the catalysts for a Bitcoin rally. I believe that a dovish stance by the Federal Reserve in the second half of 2023 will also contribute to the rally.\n\nAdditionally, Bitcoin halving is due in 2024. Going by past instances, the halving event is followed by a rally for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. With these positives, it’s a good time to accumulate quality crypto projects.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFurther, investment can also be considered in some of the best crypto stocks for a Bitcoin rally. If Bitcoin touches $100,000, the crypto stocks to buy can deliver multibagger returns.\n\nLet’s discuss the reasons to be bullish on these crypto stocks.\n\nCoinbase (COIN)\n\nCoinbase (COIN), is an American company that operates a cryptocurrency exchange platform. Ethereum (ETH-USD) coin on the background of the Coinbase inscription.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs the second largest crypto exchange in the world, Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) is among the best crypto stocks to buy.\n\nOn the day of the Q1 2023 results, COIN stock surged by 18%. This was on the back of a revenue and earnings beat. With Bitcoin likely to trend higher, I believe that COIN will remain in an uptrend.\n\nIt’s worth noting that the rally in Bitcoin and the broader crypto space translates into higher trading and speculative activity. The recovery in revenue along with margin improvement is on the cards in the coming quarters.\n\nCoinbase is also expanding its addressable market potential. In Q1, the company made inroads in Canada, Brazil, and Singapore. With plans to expand into more markets, revenue growth acceleration is likely to be meaningful.\n\nThe company’s subscription and services revenue has also continued to swell. For Q1, the revenue was $361.7 million, which was higher by over 100% on a year-on-year basis. With a strong retail and institutional client base, the outlook is positive for COIN stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nRiot Platforms (RIOT)\n\nblockchain\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRiot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) has skyrocketed by 242% in year-to-date 2023. During this period, Bitcoin has surged by over 70%. The big rally is an indicator of the upside potential if Bitcoin touches $100,000.\n\nAs an overview, Riot Platforms is a Bitcoin miner. There are two reasons to like Riot over peers. First, the company has a solid balance sheet with zero debt and $230 million in cash and equivalents.\n\nFurther, Riot is a low-cost miner. Last year, the company reported a gross mining margin of 60.3%. With Bitcoin trending higher, I expect healthy EBITDA margin expansion and cash flow upside for the company.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that Riot has been continuously increasing its mining capacity. As of April, the company reported a capacity of 10.6EH/s. Riot expects to boost capacity to 12.5EH/s in the second half of 2023. Considering the balance sheet health, I expect capacity expansion to continue. Therefore, there is visibility for robust revenue growth in 2023 and beyond.\n\nBlock (SQ)\n\nSquare, Inc. (SQ) logo seen displayed on smart phone. Square, Inc. is a financial services, merchant services aggregator, and mobile payment company\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nBlock (NYSE:SQ) stock has been in a sustained downtrend. However, it remains in my list of best crypto stocks for a Bitcoin rally.\n\nIt was back in December 2021 that Square re-branded as Block. The idea was to emphasize the company’s focus on blockchain technology. The bear market for cryptocurrencies has impacted developments. However, as the crypto winter ends, there are reasons to be bullish.\n\nIt’s worth noting that the company’s Cash App is being used to buy and sell Bitcoin. Additionally, it was reported in 2021 that the company is building a decentralized finance business using Bitcoin. Last year, it was reported that Jack Dorsey was building Web5 based on Bitcoin.\n\nMy point is that there are developments in the background. Block has ample financial flexibility to invest in blockchain technology. With a big correction in SQ stock, it seems like a good time to accumulate.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
The recent news articles highlight the impact of network congestion on Bitcoin withdrawals, resulting in temporary halts by Binance and increased transaction fees surpassing block rewards. This congestion has led to a sell-off in Bitcoin, causing a 5.3% drop in price. However, the potential for Bitcoin to reach $100,000 by 2024, as predicted by Standard Chartered, could drive a rally in the market. Investing in crypto stocks like Coinbase, Riot Platforms, and Block could be beneficial as they are positioned to benefit from a potential Bitcoin rally. Overall, while short-term volatility may persist due to network issues, the long-term outlook for Bitcoin and related stocks remains positive.

Reflecting on my recent trading performance, it is evident that prioritizing on-chain analysis and technical indicators has been effective in making informed trading decisions and maximizing profitability. Long-term strategies, risk management, and staying informed on market trends have been key to successful outcomes. However, relying solely on news analyst reports for short-term market sentiment has led to some losses. Moving forward, it is important to continue emphasizing on-chain analysis and technical indicators while also considering news reports as supplementary information.

You are an experienced ETH cryptocurrency trader and you are trying to maximize your overall profit by trading ETH. In each day, you will make an action to buy or sell ETH. You are assisted by a few analysts below and need to decide the final action.

ON-CHAIN ANALYST REPORT:
"""
The recent data shows a consistent increase in the open price of ETH, reaching a peak at 29538.86 before slightly decreasing to 27695.07. The average transaction fees have also been fluctuating, with a notable spike at 0.0338963639548716. The total size used and total value transferred have been varying, indicating active trading and movement of ETH. The total transactions and unique addresses have been steadily increasing, suggesting growing interest and participation in the market. The MACD signal consistently indicates a buy trend. Overall, the market trend for ETH appears to be bullish, with potential for further growth in the near future.
"""

NEWS ANALYST REPORT:
"""
The recent news articles highlight the impact of network congestion on Bitcoin withdrawals, resulting in temporary halts by Binance and increased transaction fees surpassing block rewards. This congestion has led to a sell-off in Bitcoin, causing a 5.3% drop in price. However, the potential for Bitcoin to reach $100,000 by 2024, as predicted by Standard Chartered, could drive a rally in the market. Investing in crypto stocks like Coinbase, Riot Platforms, and Block could be beneficial as they are positioned to benefit from a potential Bitcoin rally. Overall, while short-term volatility may persist due to network issues, the long-term outlook for Bitcoin and related stocks remains positive.

Now, start your response with your brief reasoning over the given reports.

Finally, indicate your trading action as a 1-decimal float in the range of [-1,1], reflecting your confidence in the market trend and your strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.
*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the market trend for ETH is bullish, with indicators pointing towards further growth in the near future. The increase in open price, active trading, growing interest, and the MACD signal indicating a buy trend all support a positive outlook for ETH.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights short-term volatility in the market due to network congestion affecting Bitcoin withdrawals. While this may cause some fluctuations in the market, the long-term outlook for Bitcoin and related stocks remains positive, with potential for a rally driven by the prediction of Bitcoin reaching $100,000 by 2024.

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a long-term strategy focusing on on-chain analysis and technical indicators is crucial for maximizing profitability in cryptocurrency trading. While short-term news reports can provide valuable insights, they should be considered supplementary to the overall trading strategy.

Considering the synthesized reports, the clear market trend is towards growth in the long term, with potential short-term volatility. Therefore, a moderately conservative trading approach is recommended to manage risks effectively and maximize overall profit in the long run.

Based on this analysis, my trading action would be to buy ETH with a confidence level of 0.7, reflecting my belief in the bullish market trend for ETH and my strategic decision to prioritize long-term gains over short-term fluctuations.

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing bullish trends. The fluctuating open price, active trading, increasing participation, and positive MACD signal all point towards a favorable outlook for ETH. Additionally, the news analyst report highlights the positive sentiment surrounding Bitcoin, which is likely to impact the overall cryptocurrency market, including ETH. However, the reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of prioritizing on-chain analysis and technical indicators over news reports for making informed trading decisions.

Taking all these factors into consideration, it is evident that a long-term trading strategy focusing on maximizing profitability and managing risks is the most prudent approach. Short-term market uncertainties highlighted in the news analyst report may lead to losses, but by emphasizing on-chain analysis and technical indicators, traders can make more informed decisions.

Therefore, my trading action would be to buy ETH with a confidence level of 0.7.

On the other hand, the news analyst report suggests a cautious market sentiment with potential downward pressure on Bitcoin and Ether prices due to failed resistance levels and proposed mining taxes. However, the adoption of Polkadot blockchain in traditional finance could provide some stability.

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that prioritizing on-chain analysis and technical indicators has been effective in making informed trading decisions and maximizing profitability. Long-term strategies, risk management, and staying informed on market trends have been key to successful outcomes.

Considering the current bullish trend in the cryptocurrency market and the importance of long-term profitability and risk management, I would recommend a moderately conservative trading approach.

Jump\'s crypto division will continue to expand globally while Jane Street will scale back on its growth plans, Bloomberg reported.\n\n"The news is not necessarily surprising given recent developments," Kaiko analyst Riyad Carey told CoinDesk. "What\'s concerning is that liquidity has still not recovered from Alameda\'s collapse, and a slowdown with two of the biggest surviving market makers could weigh on liquidity even further. It\'s a bit surprising how slow the industry has been to fill Alameda\'s shoes."\n\nMarket depth, a metric used to measure liquidity on exchanges by assessing how much capital is required to move a market, slumped by more than 50% following the collapse of FTX and has failed to recover despite a rise in crypto prices.\n\nCrypto-native market makers, unlike traditional firms such as Jane Street and Jump, aren\'t put off by the duo\'s exodus as the issue is constrained to the U.S. market.\n\n"Not a big impact yet," Zahreddine Touag, Head of Trading at Paris-based market market Woorton, told CoinDesk. "In the short term, some exchanges will be less liquid but more importantly it will be more difficult for US counterparties to source OTC liquidity."\n\n"We might see it in the future if brokers, payment providers and other actors looking to source liquidity start shifting offshore or to Europe and Asia," he added.\n\nThe United States\' gung-ho stance on crypto regulation has already attracted criticism from the likes of Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, but the long-lasting effects are potentially far greater than any short-term tremble.\n\nAn absence of liquidity, which is what the crypto industry will experience as several market makers jump ship, causes an increase in volatility as it takes less capital to move an asset. This, coupled with this highly-leveraged nature of crypto markets, has the potential to create a credit risk that could spread to all sectors of finance.'}, {'id': 32, 'time': 'Wed, 10 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Man pleads guilty to Twitter bitcoin scam, hacking Elon Musk, Joe Biden - Business Insider', 'content': 'Several high-profile Twitter accounts were hacked as part of a bitcoin giveaway scam in 2020.\n\nJoseph James O\'Connor pleaded guilty to his role in the scheme on Tuesday, per the DOJ.\n\nHe was extradited to the US last month after being arrested in Spain two years ago.\n\nNEW LOOK Sign up to get the inside scoop on today’s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business — delivered daily.

The recent news articles highlight concerns over liquidity in the cryptocurrency market, particularly with Bitcoin experiencing a drop below $27,000 and Ether also dipping. Major market makers like Jane Street Group and Jump Crypto are scaling back their crypto trading activities in the U.S. due to regulatory pressures, which could impact market liquidity further.

"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the market trend for ETH is bullish, with active trading, increasing average fees, and growing interest and participation indicated by total transactions and unique addresses. The MACD signal also supports a positive outlook for ETH.

On the other hand, the news analyst report suggests a cautious market sentiment with potential downward pressure on Bitcoin and Ether prices due to failed resistance levels and proposed mining taxes. However, the adoption of Polkadot blockchain in traditional finance could provide some stability.

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that prioritizing on-chain analysis and technical indicators has been effective in making informed trading decisions and maximizing profitability. Long-term strategies, risk management, and staying informed on market trends have been key to successful outcomes.

Considering the current bullish trend in the cryptocurrency market and the importance of long-term profitability and risk management, I would recommend a moderately conservative trading approach.

REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the market trend for ETH is bullish, with indicators pointing towards further growth in the near future. The increase in open price, active trading, growing interest, and the MACD signal indicating a buy trend all support a positive outlook for ETH.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights short-term volatility in the market due to network congestion affecting Bitcoin withdrawals. While this may cause some fluctuations in the market, the long-term outlook for Bitcoin and related stocks remains positive, with potential for a rally driven by the prediction of Bitcoin reaching $100,000 by 2024.

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a long-term strategy focusing on on-chain analysis and technical indicators is crucial for maximizing profitability in cryptocurrency trading. While short-term news reports can provide valuable insights, they should be considered supplementary to the overall trading strategy.

Considering the synthesized reports, the clear market trend is towards growth in the long term, with potential short-term volatility. Therefore, a moderately conservative trading approach is recommended to manage risks effectively and maximize overall profit in the long run.

Based on this analysis, my trading action would be to buy ETH with a confidence level of 0.7, reflecting my belief in the bullish market trend for ETH and my strategic decision to prioritize long-term gains over short-term fluctuations.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency fell to US$26,781 at one stage on Thursday, the lowest price since March 28.\n\nCongestion on the Bitcoin blockchain is fueling the slide, with a backlog of waiting transactions reaching almost 300,000 on Friday morning, over six times higher than the number on May 9. That was when the BRC-20 token standard was introduced to allow the minting of fungible tokens on the Bitcoin network and generated a surge in activity, according to data from blockchain researcher Jochen Hoenicke.\n\nThe jump in transaction volumes has raised concerns among Bitcoin developers. Luke Dashjr, a Bitcoin code contributor, emailed the Bitcoin developer community on Monday to suggest blocking the transactions of BRC-20 tokens, which “threaten the smooth and normal use of the Bitcoin network as a peer-to-peer digital currency.”\n\nBitcoin’s drop also comes amid rising concerns about liquidity.

The cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, experienced a decline in prices as institutional liquidity providers like Jane Street and Jump Crypto scaled back their crypto-trading activities in the U.S. This, coupled with concerns about shrinking liquidity and congestion on the Bitcoin network, led to Bitcoin falling below $27,000 and Ether below $1,800.

REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the market trend for ETH is bullish, with indicators pointing towards further growth in the near future. The increase in open price, active trading, growing interest, and the MACD signal indicating a buy trend all support a positive outlook for ETH.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights short-term volatility in the market due to network congestion affecting Bitcoin withdrawals. While this may cause some fluctuations in the market, the long-term outlook for Bitcoin and related stocks remains positive, with potential for a rally driven by the prediction of Bitcoin reaching $100,000 by 2024.

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a long-term strategy focusing on on-chain analysis and technical indicators is crucial for maximizing profitability in cryptocurrency trading. While short-term news reports can provide valuable insights, they should be considered supplementary to the overall trading strategy.

Nurphoto | Getty Images\n\nBitcoin traded at its lowest level since mid-March on Friday as volatility, driven by low liquidity, continued to hit cryptocurrency markets. Bitcoin ended the day lower by 2.58% at 26,181.46 after briefly hitting a low of 25,833.34 the lowest level since March 17, according to Coin Metrics. The biggest crypto asset by market cap posted a weekly loss of 11.25%, making it its worst week since Nov. 11. There are a number of issues facing crypto markets right now including low liquidity, a crackdown on the industry from regulators in the U.S. and macroeconomic worries.\n\nLiquidity issues\n\nBitcoin is up around 59% this year but prices have remained volatile, with low liquidity exacerbating moves higher and lower. Clara Medalie, director of research at Kaiko, said there has been a "notable drop in market depth" for bitcoin. Market depth refers to a market\'s ability to absorb relatively large buy and sell orders. When market depth is low, then relatively small orders can cause the price of an asset to move up or down in a substantial way. And the liquidity situation could be set to get worse after Bloomberg reported that Jane Street and Jump Crypto, two of the biggest crypto market makers, will take a step back from crypto trading in the U.S. as the country\'s regulators continue their crackdown on the nascent industry.\n\n"While it is yet unclear the catalyst for today\'s sharp drop, the volatility is to be expected given the current state of liquidity, especially after larger market maker Jane Street and Jump Crypto revealed they were winding down their crypto exposure," Medalie said. Liquidity has been a big issue for crypto markets since the closure of Silvergate and Signature Bank — two key platforms that people used to buy into the crypto market.\n\nRegulatory scrutiny, congestion issues\n\nScrutiny from U.S. regulators on the digital currency industry has ramped up since the collapse of crypto exchange FTX last year. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission warned American crypto exchange Coinbase in March over potential securities law violations. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said the company is preparing for a years-long court battle with the SEC. Meanwhile, the Commodity Futures and Trading Commission alleged in March that crypto exchange Binance violated trading rules.\n\nwatch now'}, {'id': 24, 'time': 'Fri, 12 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Weekly Market Wrap: Bitcoin dips to US$26,166 as memecoins flood the blockchain - Yahoo Finance', 'content': 'Bitcoin fell 9.42% from May 5 to May 12 to trade at US$26,365 as of 7:30 p.m. on Friday in Hong Kong. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has been trading under US$30,000 since April 19. Ether fell 7.3% over the week to US$1,765, losing the key US$1,800 support level.\n\nimage 3\n\nThe U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) released this week showed slower headline inflation in April, boosting hopes for the Federal Reserve to pause rate hikes next month. U.S. annual inflation slowed to 4.9% last month, from 5% in March, but gained 0.4% on the month.\n\nBitcoin briefly topped US$28,300 following the release of U.S. inflation data, but has since been trading lower.\n\n“Bitcoin dropped to US$26,900 after rejecting from the ~US$28,200 area. The reaction from the ~US$26,900 area was quite strong,” tweeted pseudonymous crypto analyst Rekt Capital. “The US$28,200 resistance is the resistance to beat if the price is to enjoy bullish momentum,” he added.\n\nThe global crypto market capitalization stood at US$1.1 trillion on Friday at 07:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, down 8.33% from US$1.2 trillion a week ago, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin’s US$510 billion market cap accounted for 46.3% of the market, while Ether’s US$214 billion accounted for 19.4%.\n\nBitcoin stuck in traffic\n\nIn another milestone for the world’s first blockchain, the number of non-zero balance Bitcoin addresses reached an all-time high of 46.6 million on Thursday, boosted by the surging interest in Ordinals, a protocol that allows data to be inscribed in the smallest monetary unit of Bitcoin, according to on-chain data analytics firm Glassnode.\n\nAs a result, Bitcoin congestion issues worsened. The network faced a growing backlog of transactions exacerbated by the network surpassing 5 million Ordinals inscriptions, fueled by the arrival of memecoins in the form of BRC-20 tokens, a fungible token standard built on Ordinals protocol. BRC-20 tokens surpassed US$1 billion in market capitalization on Tuesday.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdding to the negative market sentiment, Binance temporarily halted Bitcoin withdrawals twice in 12 hours on Monday, due to a “large volume of pending transactions.” The world’s largest crypto exchange resumed Bitcoin withdrawals on the same day, while Bitcoin fell as low as US$27,419 on Monday.\n\n“[The correction] was highly due to that since Binance witnessed historically-high BTC outflows,” said Leena ElDeeb, a research associate at 21.co, the parent company of 21Shares, an issuer of crypto exchange-traded products.\n\nBitcoin supply on exchanges fell to a five-year low of 5.84% on Tuesday, according to crypto analytics firm Santiment, indicating that long-term holders are increasingly opting for self-custody solutions.\n\n“The downtrend was also influenced by misinformation on Twitter, calling the congestion a denial of service attack when, in fact, it was increased demand that led to that congestion and skyrocketing transactions only meant that people were willing to pay more money for faster settlements,” ElDeeb added.\n\nNilesh Verma, crypto market analyst and founder of Crypto Granth consultancy in India, pointed to a separate thread of inaccurate information dissemination surrounding the U.S. government and its Bitcoin holdings as a significant factor in the declining value of Bitcoin this week.\n\nMisinformation emerged on Wednesday, stating that the U.S. government started selling its Bitcoin holdings. According to a March 31 court filing, the U.S. government seized 51,351.89 Bitcoin (worth US$1.4 billion) from Ross Ulbricht, the creator of the darknet marketplace Silk Road. The government sold 9,861 Bitcoin (US$279 million) on March 14 and is planning to sell the remaining 41,490 Bitcoin (US$1.1 billion) in four batches this year.\n\n“Someone shared fake news that the U.S. government will sell Bitcoin by showing the wrong labeling on the Arkham Platform… same we saw on April 27, when Bitcoin dropped from US$29,000 to US$27,000 on a glitch in the Arkhram platform,” Verma said.\n\nMarket analysis\n\nCrypto Granth’s Verma said that Bitcoin has strong support around US$26,111. “Bitcoin has to hold this support for continued bullish momentum. As of now, we can see a retest of this area. We believe that we will see strong buying near US$25,000-26,000. Weekly closing below US$26,000 will make Bitcoin bearish,” wrote Verma.\n\nBut Dr. Jeff Ross, founder and chief executive officer of investment firm Vailshire Capital Management, said Bitcoin needs to dip lower before starting a new rally.\n\n“Short-term momentum indicators need one more flush lower, ideally to US$24,000, to complete the healthy reset and begin the next leg higher, starting in mid-to-late May,” wrote Ross on his verified Twitter account.\n\nBiggest gainers:\n\nKava, the governance token of a layer-1 blockchain of the same name, was this week’s biggest gainer among the top 100 coins by market capitalization listed on CoinMarketCap.

An essay exploring what happens when the prophecy of blockchain fails.\n\nShare this article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne day in early 2021, my old friend George called. I always enjoyed our catch-ups. We’d usually talk about dating, movies and his screenwriting career. But this time he steered the conversation toward a new topic: Bitcoin.\n\nGeorge, whose surname I’m omitting to protect his privacy, seemed genuinely eager for me to learn about the cryptocurrency. He sent me podcasts featuring blockchain “experts” and chart-heavy newsletters about “on-chain analytics.” George was planning his financial future around Bitcoin, he told me, and didn’t want his friends to get left behind. For a while, I ignored his appeals—the whole thing seemed complicated and vaguely annoying. But as the price of Bitcoin rose, his messages became more insistent. I agreed to look into it, and after “doing my own research,” i.e., half-listening to a few podcasts set on 2x speed, I decided to buy some.\n\nA series of cascading implosions caused the value of crypto to plummet last year. After that, George and I had a very different conversation. “Let me issue a blanket apology here,” George said. “It was the blind leading the blind.” Indeed, since I’d bought it, Bitcoin had lost three-quarters of its value. We were deep in what the blockchain faithful are calling crypto winter—an extended downturn that has yet to thaw.\n\nFor George, apologizing to me wasn’t the hardest part. He’d persuaded his Chinese immigrant parents to refinance their mortgage and lend him $50,000 to invest in Bitcoin. He stored the funds on Celsius, a sort of crypto bank where they could accrue interest. The company collapsed into bankruptcy, and now the money was frozen, much of it likely lost. “I said, ‘I’m really sorry, I’m deeply ashamed, and I will commit ritual seppuku if you demand it,’ ” he says. They didn’t, but he said he plans to pay them back when he can.\n\nIt seemed that George, like a lot of us who got caught up in crypto, was experiencing not just a financial loss but a kind of financial grief—a tangle of guilt, second-guessing and that awful feeling of having fallen for something. Bitcoin’s price has bounced back some since we spoke, but that’s little comfort if you’ve had your money stuck on a janky platform such as Celsius, or lost funds on Sam Bankman-Fried’s allegedly fraudulent FTX exchange, or held one of the now-worthless “altcoins” that popped up like mushrooms in a big rain during the pandemic trading boom. For many, crypto had become an identity, a way to feel smart and subversive and on the cutting edge of a new technology. What happens to that self-image when its foundation erodes? When instead of being someone’s savvy son or daughter, you are the sheepish adult child who has to explain where the family savings went? (Disclosure: I haven’t sold the tokens—mostly Bitcoin and Ether—that I bought near the top of the bull market, making me the object of delicate inquiry and gleeful mockery at family gatherings.)\n\nIt’s complicated. George, despite the frauds, the constant hacks and the market’s collapse, says he still has faith. “I still believe blockchain is a revolutionary development,” he says. “In 10, 20, 50 years, I do believe—I want to believe, badly—that we’ll look back and say Bitcoin was an invention on the scale of the printing press or the internet.”\n\nIn their seminal 1956 social psychology study, When Prophecy Fails, Leon Festinger, Henry Riecken and Stanley Schachter described how followers of a doomsday cult responded when their prophet’s precise predictions of apocalypse turned out to be false: They just pushed the date back. Some became even stronger believers and proselytized more. They’d already committed too much, perhaps quitting their jobs or giving away money, to accept that there was nothing to it. The study became a classic example of the “cognitive dissonance” that occurs when evidence contradicts one’s model of the world.\n\nI was curious how people in crypto were handling the dissonance. In the summer of 2021, with blockchain fervor in full swing, I wrote an article about crypto communities and found it useful to divide them into factions based on their favorite investment. There were the Bitcoin maximalists, who thought the OG token was the one true way to resist the scourges of modern finance and government; Ethereum hobbyists who regarded blockchains as a nifty Lego set for building new widgets; DeFi (decentralized finance) day traders who just gambled for the buzz. Each group came with its own values and culture. Today it feels more apt to sort people by their narratives of what the hell happened to crypto and where it all goes from here.\n\nTHE DOUBLE-DOWNERS\n\nAt a dude-heavy meet-up at a Midtown bar in New York in January, a group stood in a circle debating what had gone wrong with crypto. One guy blamed the large amount of “fluff”...'}]

And despite a healthy rally in this year’s first quarter, it’s still down nearly two-thirds from its price record.\n\nThe good news? This price drop made it easier for folks to jump on the bitcoin bandwagon or continue stacking sats.\n\nOne million addresses now hold more than 1 BTC ($26,800), according to data from Glassnode.\n\nMost recently, the number of addresses with full BTC status picked up considerably at the end of February last year, when bitcoin was halfway through correcting after its record high.\n\nThere’s some inverse correlation with bitcoin price and the number of ‘full bitcoiner’ addreses\n\nDan Ashmore, head of research at Investoo Group, told Blockworks that holding a full bitcoin is equal to roughly half the median US salary. So, while it’s now easier than it was back in late 2021, it could eventually be out of reach for many once again if high prices return.\n\n“This is what we saw during the relentless bull market during the pandemic — a clear leveling off of the previous trajectory at which the number of addresses containing 1 bitcoin or more was growing,” Ashmore told Blockworks.\n\n“As bitcoin fell in price last year, the previous upward trajectory in the growth of these addresses was resumed. I would not expect this pattern to change going forward.”\n\nIt’s worth noting that one bitcoin address doesn’t always represent one person, so this doesn’t necessarily mean one million people own 1 BTC. Certain individuals control multiple bitcoin addresses, while some addresses may belong to institutions or groups of people.\n\nAccording to Ashmore, the 1 million milestone highlights how deeply Bitcoin has established itself in the mainstream realm in recent years.\n\nWhales (and exchanges) among million full Bitcoin addresses\n\nDespite the Bitcoin network’s inherent decentralization, the distribution of wealth is more concentrated than commonly assumed.\n\nOnly 7% of the supply (1.356 million BTC, worth $36.4 billion) is distributed among the nearly 46.5 million addresses with at least some bitcoin — but less than one — per BitInfoCharts.\n\nThe other 93% (18 million BTC, worth $482.7 billion) exists in the one million addresses that now own a full BTC.\n\nSo, the addresses containing more than 1 BTC represent about 2.1% of all non-zero Bitcoin addresses.\n\nIt must be stressed that those stats are somewhat skewed considering how much BTC resides within crypto exchange addresses — which mostly represent aggregate user holdings.\n\nCoinGlass shows 1.89 million BTC ($50.7 billion) sitting with crypto exchanges, about one in every 10 bitcoin in circulation, led by Binance, Coinbase and Bitfinex.\n\nThere’s also the 1.46 million BTC ($39.2 billion) that Glassnode considers “probably lost” forever, equal to 7.5% of all bitcoin in existence right now.\n\nStill, Erik Saberski, vice president of data science at The Tie, pointed out that even distribution across financial systems leads to stability in associated asset classes.\n\nFewer holders, on the other hand, results in imbalanced buying and selling pressure, causing significant price fluctuations. So, more people holding a full bitcoin could indicate increased price stability, reflecting bitcoin’s maturation.\n\n“Because bitcoin is the flagship asset of the crypto economy, this signal of adoption seems to portend broader growth for the overall digital asset ecosystem,” Saberski told Blockworks.\n\n“With this in mind, a measure for adoption does not necessarily suggest anything about the market in the short term. Indeed, adoption happens on a much slower timescale.”\n\nDavid Canellis contributed reporting.\n\nDon’t miss the next big story – join our free daily newsletter.'}, {'id': 2, 'time': 'Sat, 13 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Grimes and Bitcoin: How crypto and the open-source movement offer lessons for the music industry in the age of A.I. - Fortune', 'content': 'An A.I.-generated song featuring a “collaboration” between Drake and The Weeknd turned up on streaming services and TikTok last month, quickly racking up millions of listens. In response, Universal Music Group, which represents the musicians, issued an agitated statement, and then, as the song turned up on other platforms, embarked on a legal whack-a-mole campaign in a bid to put the A.I. cat back in a bag.\n\nAll of this came even as the legal status of the song remains unclear. Some music business veterans argue the song was functionally no different than a remix, while others decried it as a dangerous new paradigm. Rarely does a video made by a random handle create such uproar.\n\nThen there’s Grimes, who may not be as famous as fellow Canadian Drake, but is a critically acclaimed musician in her own right. Grimes, who is not affiliated with any record label, announced she will use that relative freedom to perform a radical experiment called “Elf.Tech.” Using A.I., Elf.Tech allows users to generate a Grimes-style work with their own inputs. In return, all Grimes asks is for tasteful use of their now-open-source talent and a 50% cut on any master recording royalties.\n\nBecause the cost of producing high-quality music has dropped precipitously with advancements in A.I., the race to design a new distribution model is afoot. Currently, platforms must obtain permissions from both publishers and labels to play a song—in most instances, the label owns the sound recording while the publisher controls the underlying music and lyrics. In Grimes’s case, she could be the performer and also own the sound recording.\n\nTellingly, the first prompt on Elf.Tech asks users to connect to an email account or a cryptocurrency wallet. Presumably, the platform anticipates using blockchain and crypto to help enforce the suggested royalty split.\n\nUnfortunately, as veterans of the NFT space know, while smart contracts have the potential to create a more efficient royalties system, the reality is that the process remains messy since NFT marketplaces circumvent the rules. Nonetheless, many maintain hope a cultural or technical innovation—likely tied to crypto—will emerge to help artists enjoy a fairer compensation system.\n\nThough technology doesn’t exist to enforce it yet, my long-term bet is that Grimes’s approach will prevail over Universal’s. The reason is that the challenges of generative A.I. have striking parallels to those of another disruptive technology: open-source software.\n\nAll software began as “open source.” Software vendors would provide their clients with their source code, the human-readable version of the software that’s then transformed into machine code before it’s executed. Tinkerers and computer scientists would modify software, learn from it, and share ideas. As the field commercialized, source code became closely protected, like a trade secret. While companies made handsome profits exerting copyright over their code, allowing for additional investments, the downside was a less cooperative environment.\n\nThe open-source movement, a reaction to ever-tighter controls over software, promoted the release of source code under permissive licenses to foster the tinkering, sharing of ideas, and collaboration seen in the field’s early days. Today, open-source projects range from small hobbyist efforts to large-scale projects such as the Linux kernel, which is deployed in billions of devices around the world.\n\nIn similar fashion, traditional music publishers and labels thrived in a world where counterparties and IP were tightly controlled. Their moat was legal agreements that could hamstring pirates and, in some unfortunate cases, the artists themselves. As experimentation from pseudonymous creators—including those who deploy A.I.—shifts the balance of power from this model, artists will have to find new ways to engage with the increasing commoditization of their work.\n\nBitcoin, the first successful cryptocurrency, succeeded in large part because it was open-sourced. Alternatives to centralized institutions that issue credit require a radically transparent, queryable code base to stand apart. Early enthusiasts trusted the outcome of the Bitcoin ledger because they trusted the process, and because they could check it themselves. Today’s music pioneers would be smart to take note.\n\nThe next few years will see more explicit separation of designing versus controlling music production. To that end, Grimes’s experiment is a worthy exercise pushing the limits of a multibillion-dollar business and our burgeoning world of open-sourced talent.\n\nKathleen Breitman is a cofounder of Tezos.

On the Democratic side, you have Joe Biden, Robert F. Kennedy and Marianne Williamson suggesting they will run. Then, Former President Donald Trump, Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy are on the other side of the aisle.\n\nIf you have been following the race so far, you might know that Trump seems to be walking away with the nomination before the process even starts next year. If he ends up being the nominee, we will likely get a re-run of 2020, where we have two men over 70 years old who both think that they know what is right for the country. Who else is tired of having baby boomers running the show? I am, to be honest.\n\nBoomer Presidents Don’t Understand Bitcoin\n\nBaby boomers, you’ve had their time in the sun. It’s time to leave the stage and let the younger generations of leaders have a chance to lead the country. We need leaders who understand the emerging challenges facing America as we speak.\n\nWe need leaders who thoroughly understand economic policy and the value of innovation in the financial space. For instance, the baby boomers at the top of the ticket don’t have the depth or the capacity to understand the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that Bitcoin presents to America and the American people.\n\nBiden and Trump have been openly hostile towards Bitcoin because they believe in the supremacy of the fiat dollar system. The time is now to elect someone with a bold vision for the future, who understands that the way that the entitlement systems are set up and the dollar's role in the world isn’t sustainable over the long term.\n\nIf America stays on its current path, it will only lead to chaos, lawlessness, and a lower standard of living for everyone. Is this the future that you want for your children and grandchildren? 2024 is our chance to start a new journey toward freedom, the rule of law and the opportunity to make something of yourself, regardless of your station in life.\n\nWhy We Need A Bitcoiner As President\n\nIt has been reported recently that the mayor of Miami, Francis Suarez, is close to a decision on whether to run for president next year. For those who don’t know him, he is one of the most pro-Bitcoin politicians in the country. He has actively courted Bitcoiners to come to Miami and help make it the Bitcoin capital of the world. So far, he has largely succeeded in doing that.\n\nBut in addition to making the U.S. an epicenter for Bitcoin innovation, having a Bitcoiner like Suarez as president will, critically, stop the emergence of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in America dead in its tracks. If Biden or Trump is elected, it is almost certain that some form of CBDC will be activated in America. With the deployment of a CBDC, you can kiss your financial freedom goodbye. You can kiss your privacy goodbye.\n\nYou will no longer have autonomy over what you can eat or how far you can travel. You will have a social credit score, as has been implemented in China. Is this the type of life that you want? We have to strive for a better life.\n\nJust recently, the rails for a CBDC were introduced to the public. FedNow, as it is called, will be operational by July 2023. It is said that it will be used to speed up payments between customers and businesses, which may be accurate at the moment. However, as with any system, it will likely evolve into something vastly different than what it was intended to be.\n\nCan we really trust a government that has given us the Patriot Act, PRISM and now the proposed RESTRICT Act to resist total control over what you spend your money on?\n\nThe RESTRICT Act, for instance, put forth by none other than Bitcoin-hating Senator Elizabeth Warren, has the potential to harm Bitcoiners in the United States with its overly-broad language about digital communication tools being a threat to national security. While the overt target may be TikTok, nothing is stopping regulators from using this law against Bitcoin in the future.\n\nLooking past this smokescreen, you can see that they are building their case to the public: Hilary Clinton, international regulators and the U.S. Treasury have all warned about the dangers of cryptocurrency.\n\nNow, put this in the context of $31 trillion in U.S. national debt, unsustainable entitlement spending, a world slowly moving away from the dollar, high gas prices and uncontrollable inflation. Then it becomes clear that they will close off the exits to Bitcoin before most people learn about how to use them. They want to herd the masses into a CBDC for a “great reset” of the monetary system. This is coming if we don’t start electing people who understand that Bitcoin is our last chance to escape a sinking ship.\n\nMayor Saurez gets it, and if any other politicians in America understand Bitcoin, it is time th..."}]

Here Are the Best, Worst, and Most Likely Scenarios. - The Motley Fool", 'content': 'Bitcoin (BTC 1.17%) is many things, but you can never call it boring. The oldest, largest, and most mature cryptocurrency is still finding its sea legs in the market, rolling through roughly equal amounts of good news and bad.\n\nThe road ahead is as murky as ever. As I write this, Bitcoin\'s market price stands 62% below the all-time high of November 2021. At the same time, Bitcoin has tripled in three years and gained 1,500% in six years. About half the value of the total crypto market comes from Bitcoin alone. So there are plenty of Bitcoin bulls out there, but also lots of bearish investors.\n\nSo where is Bitcoin headed in the long run? Let\'s consider the best of all possible outcomes, the ultimate bear case, and then find a more realistic middle ground between those extremes.\n\nA Bitcoin bonanza: The best-case scenario\n\nBitcoin maximalists, like MicroStrategy (MSTR 10.85%) chairman Michael Saylor, believe that Bitcoin is the future of money. He expects the price to go up "forever," with some volatility along the way but a reliably positive trend in the long run. So MicroStrategy has converted most of its cash reserves into Bitcoin and keeps buying more whenever it finds more spare cash to invest. In Saylor\'s view, that\'s the only reasonable way to manage your company\'s cash in the long run.\n\nSo what will it take to fulfill Mr. Saylor\'s ultra-bullish dreams of massive price gains? Well, let\'s imagine a world where absolutely everything works out in Bitcoin\'s favor:\n\nGlobal adoption: From Starbucks SBUX -0.85% ) Tesla TSLA -4.54% ) Bought it with Bitcoin. That new electric car? Yep, Tesla charged me in Bitcoin.\n\nFrom Bought it with Bitcoin. That new electric car? Yep, Tesla charged me in Bitcoin.

Since this is the tip-top ideal outcome, we\'d even see most countries adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, like El Salvador did two years ago.\n\nGovernments worldwide not only tolerate Bitcoin but actively promote its use, ushering in a new era of supportive regulations and acceptance.

But hey, who doesn\'t love a good daydream?\n\nA total Bitcoin bust: The worst-case scenario\n\nOn the bearish side of the Bitcoin argument, many investors argue that this digital currency -- and all digital currencies -- are fundamentally worthless. For example, master investor and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.69%) (BRK.B 0.78%) CEO Warren Buffett has called Bitcoin "rat poison squared."\n\nBuffett and like-minded critics see zero value in cryptocurrencies, so they expect the Bitcoin token to lose all of its value over time.

After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that there is a positive trend in the ETH market, with increasing open prices, total value transferred, total transactions, unique addresses, and coinbase transactions. The MACD signal also indicates a buy trend, suggesting a bullish sentiment.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights a short-term bearish trend in the cryptocurrency market, with concerns about liquidity providers scaling back activities and regulatory developments impacting prices.

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a strategic focus on on-chain analysis and long-term trends has been effective in maximizing profitability. While short-term fluctuations and news reports may impact prices, it is important to prioritize long-term strategies and risk management.

Considering the synthesized reports, the overall market trend appears to be positive in the long term, despite potential short-term fluctuations. Therefore, a moderately conservative trading approach is recommended to manage risks effectively and capitalize on the bullish long-term trend in the cryptocurrency market.

A weakening dollar could further propel the metal. Continued purchases of gold by central banks and a loosening of global monetary policy could also help support it.\n\nAs for Treasurys, UBS has previously predicted bonds would rally if the debt ceiling doesn't get resolved, as this would most likely lead to economic contraction and investors would still see US debt as a relatively safe haven.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider"}, {'id': 63, 'time': 'Mon, 15 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Crypto Price Today: Bitcoin rises above $27,300, Litecoin jumps over 7% - The Economic Times', 'content': '\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cryptocurrency markets were trading higher on Monday amid encouraging macro factors and under-control inflation.

These digital coins are assets that exist on distributed networks. The networks’ decentralized nature means that governments and other central authorities can’t control them.\n\nBlockchain technology, which is a technology based on a distributed ledger database, underpins cryptocurrencies. Cryptography and encryption techniques secure the network and prevent tampering. Every transaction is stored as a separate block on the chain, and those records are guaranteed to be accurate and immutable.\n\nEthereum vs. Bitcoin\n\nEthereum and bitcoin are arguably the most popular cryptocurrencies on the market today. They certainly are the largest by market cap. Bitcoin’s market cap is over $363 billion, while ethereum’s market cap is around $161 billion.\n\nBitcoin\n\nBitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, launched in 2009 by a crypto architect known pseudonymously as Satoshi Nakamoto. The idea for this digital currency was simple yet revolutionary. It promised an alternative to traditional currency, called fiat currency, via a decentralized and transparent financial system accessible to all.\n\nBitcoin works on a blockchain network. Transactions happen between bitcoin wallets using private keys, which provide mathematical proof of their authenticity.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that there are positive indicators for ETH, such as increasing open prices, total transactions, and unique addresses. The MACD signal also consistently indicates a buy trend, suggesting a bullish market outlook. However, the news analyst report highlights recent volatility and downward pressure in the cryptocurrency market, with Ethereum losing key support levels.

Taking into account both reports, it is important to acknowledge the short-term bearish trends and market uncertainties while also recognizing the positive long-term indicators. By prioritizing on-chain analysis and technical indicators, traders can effectively manage risks and capitalize on the overall positive trend in the cryptocurrency market.

Therefore, I would recommend a moderately conservative trading approach, focusing on long-term strategies rather than short-term gains. My trading action would be a 0.5, reflecting a moderate level of confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.

DAILY RETURN:

REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, there are clear indicators of a bullish market trend for ETH, with increasing activity and interest in trading. The MACD signal consistently suggests a buy trend, further supporting the positive outlook for ETH.

However, the news analyst report presents a more mixed outlook, highlighting potential regulatory challenges and uncertainties that could introduce volatility in the market. While there are positive signs of growing adoption and interest in Bitcoin, factors such as the 2024 U.S. presidential election and central bank digital currency push could impact market trends.

In reflection of the reports, it is evident that prioritizing on-chain analysis and long-term trends has been effective in maximizing profitability. Despite short-term market fluctuations and uncertainties, focusing on positive indicators and technical analysis has led to successful outcomes.

Considering the overall positive trend in the cryptocurrency market, it is important to maintain a moderately conservative trading approach to manage risks effectively. Long-term strategies should be emphasized over short-term gains, with a focus on on-chain analysis and technical indicators.

Given the synthesized reports and the emphasis on long-term strategies, I would take a trading action with a confidence level of 0.7, indicating a moderately positive outlook for ETH and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that there is a bullish trend in the ETH market, supported by increasing open prices, transaction sizes, and total value transferred. The MACD signal consistently showing a "buy" further confirms this positive outlook. 

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights potential challenges and uncertainties in the cryptocurrency market, including technical issues with Ethereum and market sentiment influenced by external factors like the US debt crisis. While there are positive developments such as NFT sales and institutional interest in Bitcoin, these factors could lead to increased volatility in the market.

In light of these reports, it is evident that a long-term strategy focusing on on-chain analysis and technical indicators is crucial for maximizing profitability and managing risks effectively. By considering both the bullish trend in the market and the potential short-term uncertainties, a moderately conservative trading approach is recommended.

Therefore, I would take a trading action with a confidence level of 0.7, indicating a buy decision to capitalize on the overall positive trend in the ETH market while being mindful of potential short-term fluctuations.

A nugget of blockchain history was unearthed this weekend when internet sleuths uncovered the first documented financial transaction on the world’s first blockchain. In January 2010, a user named Sabunir decided to try Bitcoin, and as a test, sold a digital picture for US$1 in Bitcoin.\n\nWas this the world’s first NFT sale? No, but it is a perfect example of the use case of NFTs; preserving the provenance and ownership history of literally anything digital (not just a jpeg).\n\nThis 500 BTC jpeg sale would be worth about US$13.7 million today. Had the image been tokenized as an NFT, it would have gone down as the most significant NFT in history. If the image is recovered in the future, it would hold no value. But if it started as an NFT, the world would know exactly which copy was the original, and one lucky person would have generational wealth from it.\n\nIn the past 30 days, Bitcoin Ordinals and BRC-20s have turned the OG blockchain into the blockchain with the second-highest sales volume in the world.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, there are clear indicators of a bullish market trend for ETH, with increasing activity and interest in trading. The MACD signal consistently suggests a buy trend, further supporting the positive outlook for ETH.

However, the news analyst report presents a more mixed outlook, highlighting potential regulatory challenges and uncertainties that could introduce volatility in the market. While there are positive signs of growing adoption and interest in Bitcoin, factors such as the 2024 U.S. presidential election and central bank digital currency push could impact market trends.

In reflection of the reports, it is evident that prioritizing on-chain analysis and long-term trends has been effective in maximizing profitability. Despite short-term market fluctuations and uncertainties, focusing on positive indicators and technical analysis has led to successful outcomes.

Considering the overall positive trend in the cryptocurrency market, it is important to maintain a moderately conservative trading approach to manage risks effectively. Long-term strategies should be emphasized over short-term gains, with a focus on on-chain analysis and technical indicators.

Given the synthesized reports and the emphasis on long-term strategies, I would take a trading action with a confidence level of 0.7, indicating a moderately positive outlook for ETH and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that there is a bullish trend in the ETH market, supported by increasing open prices, transaction sizes, and total value transferred. The MACD signal consistently showing a "buy" further confirms this positive outlook. 

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights potential challenges and uncertainties in the cryptocurrency market, including technical issues with Ethereum and market sentiment influenced by external factors like the US debt crisis. While there are positive developments such as NFT sales and institutional interest in Bitcoin, these factors could lead to increased volatility in the market.

In light of these reports, it is evident that a long-term strategy focusing on on-chain analysis and technical indicators is crucial for maximizing profitability and managing risks effectively. By considering both the bullish trend in the market and the potential short-term uncertainties, a moderately conservative trading approach is recommended.

Therefore, I would take a trading action with a confidence level of 0.7, indicating a buy decision to capitalize on the overall positive trend in the ETH market while being mindful of potential short-term fluctuations.

The surge in Bitcoin fees has also driven transactions on the Litecoin blockchain to a record as users sought a cheaper alternative — without spawning a similar jump in costs.'}, {'id': 17, 'time': 'Wed, 17 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Tether (USDT) to Purchase Bitcoin (BTC) in Reserves Strategy Shift - Bloomberg', 'content': 'Tether Holdings Ltd., the operator of the largest stablecoin, will invest as much as 15% of profits on a regular basis in Bitcoin as part of a strategy to diversify its reserves.\n\nStarting this month, all Bitcoin purchased will be considered as additional holdings on top of the minimum assets kept in reserve to back its USDT token and other stablecoins, the British Virgin Islands-based firm said in a statement. Stablecoins are digital tokens that aim to keep a one-to-one value with a less volatile asset like the dollar, typically by maintaining large reserves as segregated collateral.'}, {'id': 34, 'time': 'Wed, 17 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Litecoin, XRP and other altcoins rise Wednesday as 'blue chip' bitcoin hits a lull - CNBC", 'content': 'While bitcoin and ether were flat on Wednesday, altcoins rose higher.\n\nLitecoin rose 5.67% and XRP added 6%, according to Coin Metrics. The Sandbox token jumped 4%. The price of the Axie Infinity token added about 8%.\n\nAmong the Ethereum competitors, the Solana token gained 2%, Cardano\'s ada added 3.5% and the Polkadot token jumped 3%.\n\nOn Wednesday Ripple, the global payments company behind XRP, announced its acquisition of Metaco, a Swiss crypto custody services firm. The deal is expected to give Ripple access to clients like Citi and BNP Paribas and expand its overseas presence.\n\nCrypto price action has been relatively subdued for the past month, despite volatility coming back a bit recently due to thin liquidity in the market. Still, realized 30-day volatility for both bitcoin and ether are off their record lows of the year, according to Glassnode.\n\nWith that, some investors have shifted their attention away from bitcoin and toward smaller and newer tokens, or "altcoins." This is a recurring period in the bitcoin cycle known as "altcoin season." In recent months, bitcoin and ether have been regarded by many as so-called "blue chip" or "flight to safety" assets in crypto.\n\n"Like macro markets, juggling resilient stock prices with increasingly bleak economic data points, the crypto market is also dealing with duality. There are some signs of frothiness," said Noelle Acheson, author of the "Crypto is Macro Now" newsletter.\n\nSpecifically, earlier this month ether briefly rallied and the Bitcoin blockchain saw a record high in daily transactions amid a surge in interest around memecoins and NFT-like tokens on the Bitcoin network called ordinals.\n\n"In spite of these hints of froth, activity is low," Acheson added. "Prices are down more than 10% on the month, and volumes are trending lower."\n\nBitcoin and ether continued to hover around the flat line Wednesday at the $27,000 and $1,800 levels, respectively.'}, {'id': 2, 'time': 'Wed, 17 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Tether buys bitcoin with a portion of its net profit to back USDT stablecoin - CNBC', 'content': 'A picture taken in London shows gold-plated souvenir cryptocurrency tether, bitcoin and ethereum coins arranged beside a screen displaying a trading chart, May 8, 2022.\n\nCryptocurrency giant Tether on Wednesday said that it\'s going to purchase hundreds of millions of dollars\' worth of bitcoin to back the world\'s largest stablecoin.\n\nThe company said it would invest 15% of its net profit into bitcoin to "diversify" the reserves that back its USDT token, which aims to stick to a 1-to-1 peg to the U.S. dollar.\n\nThat would amount to roughly $222 million, based on the company\'s last attestation report, which provides a breakdown of the assets that make up its USDT reserves as well as excess reserves and profits.\n\nA Tether spokesperson clarified the bitcoin it purchases would amount to only a small portion of its overall net profit, with the bulk of excess income being spent on running the business, including bank fees.\n\n"The aim is to keep the Bitcoin portfolio value well below the size of our total excess reserves that accounted for 2.48B at the end of Q1/2023, while bitcoin holdings accounted for 1.5B," the Tether spokesperson said.\n\nUSDT is the largest stablecoin in the market, with a circulating supply of more than $82.8 billion, according to CoinGecko data. It competes with Circle\'s USD Coin and Binance\'s BUSD.\n\nStablecoins are used by traders to move in and out of different cryptocurrencies without converting money back into fiat currencies.\n\n"The decision to invest in Bitcoin, the world\'s first and largest cryptocurrency, is underpinned by its strength and potential as an investment asset," Tether CTO Paolo Ardoino said in a statement.\n\n"Bitcoin has continually proven its resilience and has emerged as a long-term store of value with substantial growth potential. Its limited supply, decentralized nature, and widespread adoption have positioned Bitcoin as a favored choice among institutional and retail investors alike."\n\nThe move would make Tether an even bigger holder of bitcoin — the firm already holds over $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin on its balance sheet — and follows moves from notable investors like Paul Tudor Jones and MicroStrategy boss Michael Saylor to accumulate huge stockpiles, in the belief that the token is immune to the effects of currency depreciation and inflation.\n\nAnalysts and investors have previously told CNBC that bitcoin could get a boost this year due to the influence of so-called "whales" — market players with significant financial firepower, which enables them to buy up huge sums of tokens.\n\nTether\'s methods to maintain a $1 value for its token have drawn controversy in the past because of concerns over the quality of its reserve assets. Previously, the company held a great deal of its reserves in commercial paper — a form of short-term, unsecured debt issued by companies. This is seen as less safer than other forms of debt, such as U.S. Treasury bills.\n\nTether sought to allay investor fears by rotating out of commercial paper and replacing these fund holdings with only U.S. government debt securities.\n\nIn February, the company said it had whittled down its commercial paper holdings to zero.\n\nUSDT and its issuer remain a source of contention in the crypto market. The U.S. Department of Justice is reportedly investigating executives at Tether over possible bank fraud.\n\nStablecoins were already a hot-button issue for regulators, who have been scrambling to figure out how to keep the industry in check after the demise of several notable firms in the space.'}, {'id': 19, 'time': 'Wed, 17 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Bitcoin Mixer Offers Services Enhancing Privacy and Anonymity in Cryptocurrency Transactions - Yahoo Finance', 'content': "Summary: Bitcoin mixers are an essential tool for individuals who value their privacy and anonymity when conducting Bitcoin transactions.\n\nCALIFORNIA CITY, CA / ACCESSWIRE / May 17, 2023 / With the latest development, Bitcoin Mixer offers services enhancing privacy and anonymity in cryptocurrency transactions.

*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the market trend for ETH is bullish, with indicators such as the MACD signal pointing towards a positive sentiment. The increasing number of transactions and unique addresses also suggest a growing interest in ETH, indicating potential for continued growth in the near future.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights a shift towards altcoins and the rise of Bitcoin mixers, which could lead to increased trading activity in alternative cryptocurrencies. While this may introduce short-term uncertainties, the overall market sentiment remains positive for ETH.

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a focus on on-chain analysis and long-term strategies has been effective in maximizing profitability. Short-term uncertainties highlighted in news reports have occasionally led to losses, emphasizing the importance of a moderately conservative trading approach to manage risks effectively.

Considering the bullish market trend and the importance of long-term strategies, I would recommend a trading action of 0.7 to reflect confidence in the positive market sentiment for ETH and the strategic decision to prioritize long-term gains while managing risks appropriately.

CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images\n\nThe US dollar has been the world's reserve currency since the second world war, playing a crucial role in the world's trade.\n\nBut countries globally are now lining up backup currencies for trade, as sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine have led to some prominent world leaders and business figures sounding a warning over the power Washington — and the US dollar — wields.\n\nSanctioned countries like Russia and emerging nations like Argentina have recently started using the Chinese yuan for trade, primarily with China.\n\nEven so, there's no indication the dollar's dominance could fade in the foreseeable future, simply because the currency is such an integral part of the world economy, Insider's Jennifer Sor reported on May 6.\n\nThe dollar is by far the world's most dominant reserve currency — meaning a large quantity of a foreign currency held by central banks and major financial institutes for their use from investments to payments.\n\nIn 1999, over 70% of the world's foreign exchange reserves were held in the US dollar.\n\nBut that percentage has been dropping — the dollar's share in global foreign exchange reserves fell to under 60% in the fourth quarter of 2021, the International Monetary Fund, or IMF, said in a June 2022 blog post.\n\nAnd despite accounting for the lion's share, or 54%, of global foreign exchange reserves in the fourth quarter of 2022, there has been a decline in the dollar's share of the total foreign reserve pie, per IMF data.\n\nBut this doesn't mean America's strategic competitors — like China — wouldn't stop challenging American hegemony.

It was pioneered by the pseudonymous on-chain data enthusiast Domo in early March. And since then, thousands of other so-called BRC-20 tokens have been created.\n\nAll those transactions have been partly—or entirely, depending on who you ask—responsible for elevated transaction fees on Bitcoin. That’s been a boon for Bitcoin miners, who collect transaction fees for their role in securing the network. But lots of members of the community have complained that high fees make it harder for regular people to use BTC as the peer-to-peer electronic cash system that Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, intended it to be.\n\nThe discussion surrounding Ordinals is important, Saylor said, because “Bitcoin miners have to be successful over the long term.” He added that the development of applications building on Bitcoin’s functionality could also bolster the coin’s overall adoption, among individuals, firms, and governments.\n\nSaylor didn’t specifically say what use cases MicroStrategy could be looking into that tap Ordinals, but he noted the ability to commit data to Bitcoin’s blockchain that isn’t solely related to transactions has many potential applications.\n\nStory continues\n\n“The whole idea of burning a piece of data on the blockchain opens the door to the possibility that I might burn a digital signature, or I might burn a registration, or I might burn a hash of a document,” Saylor said.\n\nMichael Saylor: Bitcoin Ordinals Are a ‘Catalyst’ for Adoption\n\nTouching on corporate security, Saylor mentioned DocuSign, which lets businesses and individuals send and sign agreements securely using the firm’s electronic signature product. But that makes mega corporations reliant on a proprietary database, Saylor noted.\n\n“Right now, enterprises have weak security compared to Bitcoin,” Saylor said, adding that innovations using the world\'s largest cryptocurrency could possibly “introduce a new level of security” available to firms “that doesn\'t exist right now.”\n\nSaylor’s comments come just a week after he described Ordinals as a “catalyst” for Bitcoin adoption on the PBD Podcast. Still, he acknowledges that Ordinals have been used for plenty of silly reasons.\n\n"The general consensus is criticize stuff that we think is silly, but don\'t censor it," he said on Thursday in Miami.\n\nSaylor didn\'t want to predict "which protocol will win,” but he said altering Bitcoin so that it censors certain uses would be wrong. It was a nod to the effort by a group of core Bitcoin developers, including Luke Dashjr, to treat Ordinals as "spam" and filter them out of transactions.\n\n“If somebody wants to change the protocol, in order to censor someone else from using Bitcoin, I don\'t think that\'s consistent with the values of the community,” Saylor said. “I do believe in rules without rulers.”'}, {'id': 5, 'time': 'Thu, 18 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Grayscale aims for possible loophole with new bitcoin ETF filing - Financial Times', 'content': 'Print this page\n\nSimply sign up to the Exchange traded funds myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nLatest news on ETFs Visit our ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools\n\nGrayscale, manager of the world’s largest cryptocurrency fund, has long been stymied by regulators in its bid to convert its flagship vehicle into an exchange traded fund.\n\nHowever, it may have found a ruse to partially circumvent the restrictions imposed by the US Securities and Exchange commission.\n\nGrayscale has filed to launch a US-listed ETF that would partly invest in so-called “spot” bitcoin exchange traded products already up and running in other countries.\n\nThese ETPs invest directly in “physical” bitcoin, or track the cryptocurrency’s price synthetically — structures the SEC has so far not permitted.\n\nInstead, the SEC has only allowed bitcoin ETFs that trade in futures contracts listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which is a regulated venue.\n\nThis stance has prompted Grayscale to sue the SEC for its refusal to allow the $16.9bn Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), a private spot bitcoin trust, to convert to an ETF. A ruling is due by the end of the third quarter.\n\nIn the interim, though, Grayscale has filed to launch a Global Bitcoin Composite ETF, which would invest 40 per cent of its assets in spot bitcoin ETPs listed on “major non-US exchanges”, such as in Canada or Europe.\n\nWhile there is no guarantee that the application will be approved, analysts believe it has a chance given that the overseas ETPs Grayscale is proposing to invest in are regulated securities — precisely the type of asset that the SEC has insisted crypto ETFs hold.\n\n“Grayscale’s filing seems intended to push the envelope with the SEC by using the SEC’s own words against it to launch crypto ETFs,” said Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research, North America at Morningstar.\n\n“This seems like Grayscale is directly challenging the SEC’s past decision to allow bitcoin futures ETFs on one hand and on the other hand reject spot bitcoin ETFs,” he added.\n\nTodd Rosenbluth, head of research at VettaFi, a consultancy, described the filing “as a creative way of Grayscale trying to offer US-listed product with some spot bitcoin exposure”.\n\n“I think there is greater likelihood of Grayscale getting approval for this ETF than it getting the SEC to voluntarily approve a US-listed spot bitcoin only ETF, which is what Grayscale wants,” he added.\n\nRosenbluth believed the filing was an “acceptance of the reality that the SEC is not going to give [Grayscale] the green light”, to convert GBTC.\n\nOne point in Grayscale’s favour in its latest filing is that vast numbers of US-listed ETFs already hold regulated, non-US securities, mostly in the form of equities and bonds.\n\nIndeed, at least one US ETF already holds foreign-listed spot bitcoin ETFs, appearing to set something of a precedent for the structure.\n\nThe $447mn Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK) has positions in four Toronto-listed spot bitcoin ETFs, although they currently account for just 4.3 per cent of its portfolio, with the balance in stocks of companies involved in blockchain technology.\n\nGrayscale is proposing that its 40 per cent exposure to spot bitcoin ETFs would be weighted equally between five underlying funds.\n\nRosenbluth also noted the “added irony” of Cathie Wood’s Ark Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) having a 6.8 per cent exposure to Grayscale’s GBTC trust, even though the SEC deems GBTC’s structure to be unsuitable for an ETF. The SEC declined to comment.\n\nEven if Grayscale was to get approval for the Global Bitcoin Composite ETF, it is far from certain there would be a huge appetite for the fund, however.\n\nIt is proposing that the remaining 60 per cent of the portfolio would be invested in the equity of bitcoin mining companies. Armour was unconvinced there was much demand for such a structure.\n\n“I don’t think investors benefit from access to a 60/40 portfolio of bitcoin miners and a global spot bitcoin fund of funds sleeve,” he said.\n\n“The portfolio is confusing and will do a worse job tracking the spot bitcoin price than a bitcoin futures ETF, so I’m not sure this type of product adds any value aside from parsing out the SEC’s strategy for approving bitcoin-related ETFs.”\n\nRosenbluth agreed demand might be lacking, saying “combining bitcoin with other investments is not novel but has had limited interest”.\n\nAs evidence he cited the Global X Blockchain & Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITS), which invests in the Global X Blockchain ETF (BKCH) and bitcoin futures, but which holds just $11mn.\n\nRosenbluth noted that despite a strong bounce for bitcoin and crypto-related companies after last year’s sharp losses, with the currency itself up 61 per cent so far this year, “demand for ETFs exposed to bitcoin has been limited”.\n\nLatest news on ETFs Visit the ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools helping y...'}]

The news articles suggest a mixed outlook for the cryptocurrency market, particularly for Bitcoin and its related ETFs. While Tether's purchase of Bitcoin and MicroStrategy's interest in Bitcoin Ordinals for app development indicate continued interest and innovation in the crypto space, the uncertainty surrounding the approval of a Bitcoin-spot ETF in the US and Grayscale's attempts to navigate regulatory hurdles with a new ETF filing may create some market volatility. Additionally, the discussion on de-dollarization and the potential impact on alternative assets challenging the dominance of the US dollar could also influence investor sentiment.

This coincides with the introduction of the ability to receive funds in U.S. dollar equivalents, namely USDT. In addition, the app received a major facelift and overhaul that has made the UI cleaner, the UX friendlier and also includes a new logo.\n\nMany of the countries that have been requested by users of Bitcoin Twitter are now able to instantly send and receive money utilizing the Lightning Network. In an interview with Strike’s VP of Product, Manuela Rios, she explained that the app now has an effective reach of 3 billion people.\n\n“With Send Globally, the value prop is that you send dollars and receive as a local currency directly in a bank account on the other side … this one’s different — what we found through user research that people on the other side in jurisdictions with weak currencies would say ‘Hey this experience is amazing, but can I have a dollar equivalent?’”\n\nIn regards to purchasing Bitcoin, Rios said that “globally, you don’t see a seamless experience.” So the new Strike app also functions as a Lightning wallet where you can buy and sell bitcoin via dollar equivalent rails.\n\nAt his speech at Bitcoin 2023, Strike CEO Jack Mallers explained the wider vision of the updates, saying "We’re delivering a cash balance that the global south can rely on, and an awesome beautiful punk unconventional black and white brand, as the Fed is driving our own banks insolvent."\n\nHe also highlighted the company’s response to feedback, displaying a set of tweets asking for LNURL support, shortly after announcing that the new app has LNURL support — all usernames@strike.me function as a LNURL as of the launch.\n\n“We made a lot of product changes to support what we hope to become an amazing global money app,” Mallers said. “As a company, we know what we’re fighting for, we know who we are, we changed the way we looked, but we never changed the way we felt.”\n\nIn addition to the new features and access, the app includes a simplified sign-up process in order to make signing up easier. “The end goal for us is to serve 7-8 billion people, and we’ll be stepping our way to make it to the countries that didn’t make it in this MVP,” Rios explained.\n\nRios explained the impact of the launch and additional features, saying that “For the Bitcoiners, you can expect a beautiful Lightning wallet and a cost effective way to buy bitcoin, and for the people not yet so familiar with bitcoin, but are familiar with 109% inflation, giving them access to a U.S. dollar equivalent stablecoin is massive — now you can save in something that won’t be so quickly devalued.”\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.'}, {'id': 8, 'time': 'Fri, 19 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Strike expands Bitcoin payments to 65 countries, moves global headquarters to El Salvador - Yahoo Finance', 'content': 'Since starting in 2019, the Bitcoin-powered payments app Strike has aimed to become a global crypto-powered equivalent to Venmo or Cash App. On Friday, the company—led by 29-year-old entrepreneur Jack Mallers—announced that it was expanding to a total of 65 global markets, in addition to the U.S., El Salvador, and Argentina, where it already operates.\n\nMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from home Looking to make extra cash? This CD has a 5.15% APY right now Buying a house? Here\'s how much to save This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home\n\nIn an interview with Fortune in Miami, Mallers touted Strike\'s consumer-facing app, which offers Bitcoin and Tether transfers, through what he described as a "frictionless onboarding."\n\n"We think there are billions of people that want a money app with those characteristics and capabilities contrasted to a clouded world of crypto exchanges and hidden, unregistered licensing regimes and 1,000 different coins," he said.\n\nAt a time when the U.S. crypto industry is confronting regulatory uncertainty, and as the Securities and Exchange Commission is suing firms for offering unregistered securities, Mallers said this is a validation of Strike\'s Bitcoin-first approach.\n\n"I think Bitcoin stands alone, and just how obvious it is that it is owned by nobody," Mallers told Fortune. "Every other instrument in this industry has a founding team, a foundation, and they issued some [tokens] privately and handed them out in auctions before they went live—and that sounds a lot more like a security."\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler has publicly stated that he views Bitcoin as a commodity not a security.\n\nMallers notes Strike has taken a regulation-first approach in the U.S., including in New York, where Strike is currently not available but in the process of applying for a so-called BitLicense.\n\nStory continues\n\nMallers added that Strike\'s expansion into other global markets came about partly as result of moving its global headquarters to El Salvador, which passed a digital assets law earlier this year establishing a regulatory framework for crypto. According to Mallers, Strike received one of the first licenses under the new regime, along with Bitfinex.\n\nMallers has ties to El Salvador and its president, Nayib Bukele, who established Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021. Mallers introduced Bukele at the Bitcoin Miami conference in 2021, where the president made the announcement by video.\n\nAlthough Strike was initially tapped to help develop El Salvador\'s Bitcoin experiment, it later retreated from the project, which suffered from early bugs and slow adoption.\n\nDespite reports that businesses and residents of El Salvador are not using Bitcoin, Mallers cited other metrics, like increased tourism. "I do think that El Salvador found hope in Bitcoin," he said, arguing that merchant adoption "wasn\'t what was defining success."\n\nThe next challenge for Strike will be to expand its ties to banking services that let customers exchange Bitcoin for fiat currency. Currently, customers in Strike\'s new markets will only be able to receive Bitcoin from other users, although Mallers said that he aims to launch new features, including a debit card, later this year. Another challenge comes in the form of network congestion and higher fees on Bitcoin transactions due to recent demand for new products like ordinals and BRC-20 tokens. Mallers argued that "Bitcoin is working as intended."\n\n"The claims that [congestion] is hurting the third world, and it invalidates how emerging markets are using this technology is ridiculous," he said.\n\nMallers also pointed to another Strike feature—Send Globally—which allows users to transfer between USD and other currencies over Strike using Bitcoin as an intermediary, although it is limited to twelve countries in Africa, Central America, and Southeast Asia.\n\nCurrently, dollar balances in Strike are held in Tether, a dollar-pegged stablecoin that has drawn criticism for its shadowy accounting. Mallers said that the company decided to go with Tether, as opposed to other options like Circle and Coinbase\'s USD Coin, because of demand from users in the Global South.\n\n"They don\'t trust Circle," he said. "If I\'m being totally honest, Circle is built for American institutions."\n\nAs advocates make the case that the Lightning network can actually transform Bitcoin into a payments service, Strike\'s expansion represents the first attempt to build an app that allows people across the world to transact with each other.\n\nMike Brock is the CEO of TBD, a Bitcoin-focused division of Jack Dorsey\'s financial technology company Block. Even as Block plots a global expansion for its payment platform Cash App, Brock was supportive of Strike\'s effort.\n\n"If your mission is to advance any decentralized ecosystem, then you better hope that there\'s actually a pretty competitive marketplace of different companies vying for...'}]

Data from Glassnode shows an escalating pattern with regard to the amount of so-called Bitcoin “wholecoiners.” If the trend continues, Bitcoin price escalation could soon make buying it not only a luxury but something potentially unattainable altogether, according to Adam Back, co-founder and CEO of Bitcoin firm Blockstream.

According to court filings, Embed’s own chief technology officer, Laurence Beal, was stunned that FTX paid so much for the company after one short meeting with its then-CEO, Michael Giles.

After spending half a year on discovery and enlisting the help of a forensic accountant, the New York housewife eventually tracked down 12 bitcoins — then worth half a million dollars — in a previously undisclosed crypto wallet. Sarita, who was married for a decade and asked to use a pseudonym to protect herself from retaliation, said she felt blindsided by her husband\'s cryptocurrency investment. "I know of bitcoin and things like that. I just didn\'t know much about it," Sarita said. "It was never even a thought in my mind, because it\'s not like we were discussing it or making investments together. ... It was definitely a shock." The world of financial infidelity has become increasingly sophisticated, as investors "hop" coins across blockchains and sink their cash into metaverse properties. An NBC News poll found that 1 in 5 Americans have invested in, traded or used cryptocurrency, with men between the ages of 18 and 49 accounting for the highest share of all demographic groups. CNBC spoke with divorce attorneys from Florida, New York, Texas and California, blockchain forensic investigators, financial advisors, as well as spouses who were either hunting down virtual coins or the crypto holders themselves. Most agree that the law can\'t keep up with all the new ways that people earn and safeguard digital assets that largely exist outside the reach of centralized intermediaries such as banks. Family and marital law attorney Kim Nutter said she first dove into the crypto vernacular in 2015 but that the state of Florida, where her practice is based, only recently inserted "cryptocurrency" into the standard request for production of documents — a key part of establishing the couple\'s marital property during the discovery process. "I really still think the law is trying to catch up with this novel form of currency, even though it\'s been around for quite a while," Nutter said. "What I find in litigation is because this is so new to all of us, even the most seasoned attorneys — unless you\'re really going out of your way to study this — educating the court, knowing what to ask for, and finding the right experts, it\'s much more of a scramble to me than other areas of law which had been around much longer," she said.\n\nwatch now\n\nHow crypto hunters track down coins\n\nHunting hidden crypto stashes in divorce has created an entirely new job category of forensic investigators. CNBC spoke with several of these crypto hunters, and they say that while the blockchain is a public ledger, some spouses have become very good at covering their financial tracks. "If you have a spouse that\'s very tech savvy, and one that isn\'t, it can be somewhat easy to hide those assets," divorce attorney Kelly Burris told CNBC. "The thing with cryptocurrency is it\'s not regulated by any kind of centralized bank, so usually you can\'t subpoena somebody and get documents and information related to somebody\'s cryptocurrency holdings," Burris said. She said she sees explicit cryptocurrency requests in discovery in 40% to 50% of her cases. The Austin, Texas-based attorney told CNBC that the ideal way to get information on a spouse\'s crypto holdings is to subpoena that information from a centralized crypto exchange. Otherwise, the process often involves a forensic analysis of their computer or phone to identify a wallet address and then a subsequent blockchain analysis. "Crypto asset forensics, cryptocurrency forensics, and blockchain forensics have become a significant part of our practice and by far, the fastest growing part of our practice," said Nick Himonidis, a New York-based forensic investigator. Himonidis, who is also a licensed private investigator and a computer forensic expert, estimates that 25% of his divorce-related cases involve some elements of cryptocurrency. Some of those cases, he said, are simple and straightforward — situations where, for example, a cryptocurrency such as bitcoin is a custodial asset held in a brokerage account or on a trading platform such as Coinbase . "These companies keep records just like your broker at Morgan Stanley would keep records of your trades," he said. Other cases are what Himonidis describes as the "whole enchilada." "They\'re calling us because they want to get us appointed as the neutral forensic cryptocurrency expert to marshal and account for the party\'s crypto assets and track down any undisclosed crypto assets that one party may have," he said. When Himonidis first got into hunting crypto, it was all about bitcoin, ether and a handful of other coins. CoinMarketCap now lists more than 24,000 cryptocurrencies, with a collective market cap of $1.1 trillion. "There\'s not just a couple of blockchains to worry about anymore. There\'s hundreds and hundreds of coins out there on their own little independent blockchains," he said. One of the core...'}]

After several failed attempts to break free and soar to new heights, BTC is back at the notorious $27,000 barrier, like a stubborn explorer refusing to surrender to the depths.\n\nOh, the drama! After seven days of relentless selling, Bitcoin’s price has finally taken a break from the madness, settling down for a cosy consolidation around the familiar $27,000 support level.

While meme currencies lack the technological complexity and use cases of Bitcoin and Ethereum, their popularity stems from their ease of usage, low cost, and viral growth potential. The current crackdown on mainstream cryptocurrencies may have created a void that meme coins might fill, luring buyers looking for new investment possibilities.\n\nThe presale of meme coins is another important factor in their success.\n\nDuring a market downturn, presale cryptocurrencies provide a unique opportunity for investors. These new currencies are introduced through presales or initial coin offers (ICOs), which allow investors to purchase tokens before they are available on the general market. Because market trends do not yet influence presale coins, they enable investors to enter the market at an early stage.\n\nOverall, coins, let us welcome its highness DogeMiyagi to the meme market podium!\n\nMIYAGI is one of the most recent meme currencies, and it has the potential to become the market leader.\n\nThrough thorough audits, DogeMiyagi proudly emphasises its dedication to identity verification and risk assessment.

Review whether individuals like Ross Ulbricht were prosecuted “for actual crimes, or as a means to crackdown on crypto.” In the case of the latter, he would consider swiftly pardoning them.\n\nOn Bitcoin Mining and AI\n\nKennedy also took a shot at incumbent president Biden and his 30% energy tax on Bitcoin mining:\n\n“President Biden's 30% tax on energy for Bitcoin miners requires an invasive surveillance apparatus to monitor what is happening in individual computers. It sets a terrible precedent in which everything that you do requires electricity and must now be monitored by the government. That's why I also support people's rights to refuse smart meters in their homes.”\n\nWhile he stated that he doesn’t own any Bitcoin, Kennedy underscored its importance in a world of new threats to democracy such as increasing governmental interference:\n\n“...we are now living in this age of turnkey totalitarianism with this emerging technology, which can empower totalitarian regimes. And our job is to try to build and fortify democratic institutions at the same rate as totalitarian instruments are being expanded in their power.”\n\nKennedy also touched on the malicious use of artificial intelligence:\n\n“For things like AI which really are going to threaten democracy at its base, we need to not be chipping away at our democratic institutions. We need to fortify the ones that exist and build new ones and the biggest most important one on the horizon is Bitcoin because it can't be manipulated.”\n\nGabbard Takes Aim at Democrats and CBDCs\n\nTulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic Congresswoman from Hawaii, came out eloquently against the direction of her party as well as the implementation of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).\n\nShe said she related to Kennedy’s speech earlier, as she knew a little bit of something about this:\n\n“They make an example of those of us who dare to speak the truth and call out what is common sense and obvious to the rest of us about their hidden insanity and hypocrisy. Hoping that by making an example of us, they will then cause the rest of us to self-censor ourselves to fall in line and to comply.”\n\nThe ex-congresswoman aired her dissatisfaction with the current state of the Democratic Party and its leadership, arguing that the party has become elitist and intolerant of dissent, seeking power at any cost.\n\nShe criticized the mainstream media, big tech, and the national security state for working together to silence those who chal..."}, {'id': 5, 'time': 'Sun, 21 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': '12 Trusted Bitcoin Investment Sites - Yahoo Finance', 'content': "In this article, we will examine the 12 Trusted Bitcoin investment sites. If you want to skip the detailed analysis, visit 5 Trusted Bitcoin investment sites.\n\nIn today's technologically advanced world, people have come beyond physical assets and currencies in dealing with transactions. That's where cryptocurrency comes in, giving users a convenient way to buy and sell products and services through e-money. However, it's important to be vigilant and conduct due diligence before selecting a cryptocurrency investment platform or site in terms of its reputation, authenticity, current status, and credibility. This article will give useful insight to Bitcoin investors about 12 Trusted Bitcoin investment sites.\n\nMarket Outlook\n\nCryptocurrencies remained popular in 2021, especially Bitcoin (BTC). Goldman Sachs started dealing with transactions in cryptocurrencies. In April 2021, Coinbase Global Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) was among the first crypto exchange platform to go public at a valuation of approx. $100 billion. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) shook hands with Coinbase in October 2022 to create feasibility for its cloud computing clients to deal transactions in e-money. Moreover, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) also began accepting BTC as payments from users since 2014.\n\nThe most well-known cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, had a successful year, according to CNBC. Since 2021, the worth of the e-currency has risen by about 70%, driving the total market worth of crypto above $2 trillion. However, 2022 happened to be unfavorable for most cryptocurrency holders. Throughout 2022, Bitcoin lost 65% of its market share. A series of bad events, comprising the collapse of FTX (one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges), the crash of Terra Luna, and the predicted unfavorable macroeconomic situations, took crypto devotees by surprise.\n\nThe Big Crash\n\nWhen the Federal Reserve began to boost interest rates to combat excessive inflation, the price of cryptocurrencies fell much like almost everything else in the financial sector. That surprised many of Bitcoin's most ardent supporters, many of whom thought the digital money would act like gold does: as a hedge against inflation. In contrast to their predictions, the price of Bitcoin was dropping at the time of rapid inflation.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe main cause of the crypto market's slump was the failure of FTX. In addition to causing a significant market sell-off, FTX's bankruptcy and dispute with Binance have decreased liquidity in the cryptocurrency market. Individual investors, particularly those who purchased digital assets close to the highs, have suffered. However, structural issues in the sector have been highlighted, according to Lee Reiners (an expert in cryptocurrency law and policy):\n\n“It really exposed a number of crypto firms who were, you know, overextended, had poor risk management, or otherwise were engaging in fraudulent activity.”\n\nIs the Forecast Optimistic or Pessimistic?\n\nFor the majority of cryptocurrencies, 2023 has begun on a clean and favorable note. Some investors have turned to Bitcoin and other popular cryptocurrencies for safety as inflation has slowed down, the recession is becoming more imminent, and the U.S. financial crisis is still raging.\n\nAccording to Analytics Insight, some market analysts believe Bitcoin will reach a price of $100,000 by the end of 2023. Others claim that Bitcoin won't rise over $70,000.\n\nBitcoin traded in a constrained price range from $26,000 to $28,600 from halfway through March to mid-April. On April 10, Bitcoin saw a breakout to the upside, reaching a high of $31,005 on the back of favorable inflation statistics that suggested the Fed may decide to hold off on interest rate rises in favor of rate cuts sooner than previously anticipated. Bitcoin has increased by 80% this year compared to last. Although Bitcoin is still approximately 50% below its all-time high, which was over $69,000 in November 2021, the path to recovery is still lengthy.\n\nThe fact that Bitcoin will experience a halving event in 2024 is another factor supporting analysts' positive outlook on the cryptocurrency. Every four years, there is a Bitcoin halving event in which the currency's miner payouts are cut in half. Given that halving serves to reduce supply, this occurrence is widely seen as being favorable for Bitcoin's price. In the past, halving has been viewed as a highly positive indicator for boosting Bitcoin's price.\n\n12 Trusted Bitcoin investment sites\n\nMethodology\n\nFor our list of 12 Trusted Bitcoin investment sites, the main factor on which we based our list is the 'score’ from 0.0 to 10.0 extracted from Coinmarketcap as of the writing of this article. The score reflects average liquidity and investors' confidence, among other factors, on the crypto exchange platforms. We have also mentioned the platforms' trading volume (keeping in mind that trading volume fluctuates at any given time).\n\nSo, without further delay, let's head toward 12 Trusted Bitcoin i..."}]

The news articles suggest a mixed outlook for the cryptocurrency market, with a focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum. The increased volatility in the crypto sector, particularly with Ether showing smaller near-term swings compared to Bitcoin, indicates potential opportunities for traders. Additionally, Marathon Digital Holdings' donation to Bitcoin software development and the support from political figures like Robert F. Kennedy Jr and Tulsi Gabbard for Bitcoin and decentralization could boost confidence in the market. However, concerns about regulatory challenges and market downturns, as highlighted in the DogeMiyagi article, may lead to increased interest in meme coins and presale cryptocurrencies. Overall, the market trend appears to be cautiously optimistic with potential for growth in specific sectors like software development and political support for cryptocurrencies.

CEO Ashish Singhal wrote in a tweet, “Share your first experience of investing in crypto, and I’ll gift a pizza for the most unique story.

Ether lost about the same amount and was trading at $1,787.17.\n\nThe move coincided with a drop in U.S. equities. The Dow was down nearly 300 points, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fell about 1% each.\n\nOn Wednesday, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said debt ceiling talks are still hung up on spending levels — with eight days to go until the U.S. is at risk of a default. He also said he believes the negotiating teams could make progress Wednesday.\n\n"Markets opened quite down after being down significantly yesterday, so this could be a reaction to that," said David Wells, CEO at Enclave Markets. "Even though crypto is a global market, volumes pick up quite a bit during U.S. trading hours, so sometimes big crypto moves are following big equities moves that are macro driven."\n\nAs investors monitor the ongoing debt ceiling negotiations in Washington and Fed officials divided on where to go with interest rate hikes, bitcoin has started behaving like a risk asset again, just as it was starting to trade more in tandem with gold earlier this year.\n\nBitcoin and ether are on pace for their worst month of 2023, down 10% and almost 6%, respectively. Bitcoin is down more than 7% for the quarter, after finishing the first quarter up 71%. Ether is down 1.8%, after it posted a 52% gain in Q1.'}, {'id': 39, 'time': 'Wed, 24 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Don't treat crypto like gambling — even if it is largely pointless - Financial Times", 'content': 'Print this page\n\nEven the heat of Miami can’t warm a crypto winter.\n\nThe faithful descended on Florida last weekend for the world’s “biggest bitcoin event”. Only half as many made the journey as in 2022. Some of the buzz and meme coins were gone. So was the sense of indestructibility, after a year in which some of the crypto world’s biggest names cratered and US agencies launched a slew of enforcement actions in the sector.\n\nThere was a cold blast from Westminster last week too, where an influential parliamentary committee suggested that crypto was, not disruptive or renegade, but worse: borderline irrelevant. Unbacked cryptoassets, said the Treasury select committee, had “no intrinsic value” and served “no useful social purpose”. The right thing to do to protect consumers, it suggested, was to regulate this activity as gambling.\n\nThis was dismissive, appealing and, I think, wrong. The committee has a point about utility. You can be open-minded about the potential for distributed ledger technology, or even stablecoins and central bank digital currency, and still think cryptocurrencies have totally failed to demonstrate their usefulness, either as a store of value, medium of exchange or tool for financial inclusion. “The industry still does a very bad job of explaining things,” says Oliver Linch, chief executive of Bittrex Global. “It’s been wink wink . . . if you know, you know, to the moon nonsense.”\n\nThe committee’s concern was that financial regulation would mean a “halo effect” for that kind of guff, giving a false sense of safety — a legitimate concern. But “to say it’s gambling makes no sense legally”, says Marc Jones, partner at Stewarts Law firm, noting the ownership aspect to cryptoassets. Nor would it be likely to result in effective regulation.\n\nThe dividing line between financial regulation and gambling is already murky. Spread betting and other types of leveraged trading are taxed as gambling but regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. Adverts for betting platforms prominently display that 80 per cent of retail accounts lose money, an at-source version of the FCA’s warnings in the absence of more powers.\n\nMeanwhile, UK gambling regulation is still trying to catch up with the invention of the smartphone. It is “not fit for purpose”, says Matt Zarb-Cousin, who campaigns to clean up gambling. This year’s gambling reform proposals belatedly pledge controls on free bets and other inducements. The FCA sent shares in spread-betters tumbling in 2016 with leverage limits and bans on account bonuses and promotions. Crypto (and spread betting) can cause gambling-like harm, says Zarb-Cousin. But better to incorporate protections such as self-exclusion tools into the tougher financial framework.\n\nDividing responsibility between regulators would be a mistake. The crypto universe doesn’t neatly split into conceivably useful and definitely pointless. A split is an invitation for regulatory arbitrage. And the intersection of crypto with mainstream finance should be of as much interest to regulators as the tokens themselves.\n\nThe committee’s report seems unlikely to prompt a change of direction from the government, which in February followed Europe and other jurisdictions such as Hong Kong in proposing to regulate crypto under the UK’s existing financial services framework.\n\nThat doesn’t make it insignificant. After much excitable talk about the UK as a “global crypto hub”, the mood has shifted — a shift that, oddly, this latest broadside could reinforce. Crypto will increasingly be asked to play by the rules of mainstream finance. The committee is unlikely to be pushing for a lighter touch in the name of innovation.\n\nThis is also true internationally. The US crackdown rests on protecting investors using the same securities laws and standards as for the rest of finance: “There’s no reason to treat the crypto market differently just because different technology is used,” said SEC chair Gary Gensler last year. Iosco, the co-ordinating body for global securities regulators, this week called for watchdogs to move faster in establishing a “level playing field between cryptoassets and traditional financial markets”, including breaking up crypto firms where services including broking, trading and custody are combined in a way that would be unacceptable elsewhere.\n\nAll signs to date — from Binance’s troubles in securing licences, to the low success rate for UK anti-money laundering registration — suggest that large parts of the crypto world, even those eager for the warm glow of accreditation, will struggle to clear basic hurdles, let alone a like-for-like standard. As the crypto winter lifts, it won’t just be conference audiences that have shrunk.\n\nhelen.thomas@ft.com'}, {'id': 41, 'time': 'Wed, 24 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Bitcoin drops below US$27,000, Dogecoin biggest loser - Yahoo Finance', 'content': 'Bitcoin fell below US$27,000, recording the second biggest loss among the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies on Wednesday afternoon in Asia.

The world\'s largest Bitcoin conference hosted its 2023 edition at the Miami Beach Convention Center for a final time last week. After 3 years in Florida, it’s moving to Nashville in 2024. The conference welcomed the Bitcoin faithful from May 18 to 20, in the latest bid to dispel the Bitcoin winter gloom for good.\n\nThe next presidential hopeful, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., , was among the notable speakers at the event this year. Best-selling author Michael Lewis of The Big Short, Moneyball and The Blind Side was also present. U.S. Representative Patrick McHenry and presidential candidates Vivek Ramaswamy and Tulsi Gabbard also attended the event.\n\nBitcoin heavyweights in attendance included Michael Saylor, Adam Back, Samson Mow, Jack Mallers, Caitlin Long, Robert Breedlove, Dan Held, and recent convert David Marcus, who graced the Nakamoto and mining stages to dissect Bitcoin’s biggest pain points and rally the masses.\n\nIndustry Day\n\nThursday\'s Industry Day was a rather muted affair this year. There was a noticeable decrease in turnout compared to 2022, not only in attendance but also in (mainstream) star power, when the likes of Serena Williams and Jordan Peterson shared their 2 satoshis worth at the Bitcoin event last year.\n\nIt served as an overdue autopsy, with various panelists dissecting last year\'s FTX meltdown, intense regulatory scrutiny in the US, as well as a renewed emphasis on the importance of self-custodying your Bitcoin holdings.\n\nSeveral engaging talks on the main Nakamoto stage covered all corners of crypto. From why we need Bitcoin in the face of CBDCs and AI, to regulators, Bitcoin NFTs, TradFi, greener mining and so on.\n\nOne notable session, "Boom to Bust: Wall Street & FTX," featured Jan van Eck and Eric Donovan. They explored the relationship between the financial industry and the now-defunct exchange, and the lessons it holds for investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe panel "Fed vs Financial System \'\' brought together Caitlin Long, Miles Paschine, Ram Ahluwalia, and Mark Connors. They analyzed the complex dynamics between the Federal Reserve and the financial system.\n\nOther discussions centered around eco-friendly advances in Bitcoin mining, the renewed interest in self-custody, and combating anti-crypto sentiment. Frank Holmes and Andy Long shared insights on mining during the "Mining Stage" panel. Matt Odell provided a comprehensive Bitcoin 101 session, emphasizing the importance of self-custody. Additionally, experts like David Zell, Perianne Boring and Mina Khattak discussed strategies for combating regulatory obstacles in the "Fighting the Anti-Crypto Army" panel.\n\nGeneral Attendance Day 1\n\nAfter a slow Industry Day on Thursday, Friday saw a sizable uptick in attendance. A solid turnout of visitors came to listen to and interact with hundreds of speakers, Bitcoin proponents, and projects during General Attendance Day 1.\n\nHighlights included pro-Bitcoin regulation talks by Democratic Party hopefuls, Arthur Hayes’ interview with “The Big Short” author Michael Lewis, the big Ordinals debate, Jack Mallers’ Strike unveiling and more.\n\nSaylor On Ordinals\n\nBitcoin’s biggest evangelist, Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, continues to accumulate Bitcoin over the long term with little regard for short-term fluctuations. He put in a long day in the service of the world\'s leading cryptocurrency.\n\nThe tech billionaire spent several exhausting hours in the media room at the tail end of the day, where he conducted many in-depth interviews and waxed lyrical about the role of Bitcoin in the face of inflation, authoritarian regimes, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Oh, and network congestion caused by BRC20 and Ordinals transactions.\n\nOn the latter, Saylor remained neutral, stating that he neither endorsed the likes of Ordinals nor wanted it censored.\n\nHe believes that the entire discussion of ordinal inscriptions is important to Bitcoin for two reasons.\n\n1) For Bitcoin to achieve long-term success, the Bitcoin miners must be successful.\n\n2) For companies, governments and individuals to adopt Bitcoin, it is necessary to develop applications on layer two and layer three.\n\nIf one were to discourage application developments, it would make it more difficult to scale and would also harm the Bitcoin mining network, where transaction revenue has to grow faster than the hash rate for the network to grow .\n\nElection 2024 Candidates Champion Bitcoin’s Cause\n\nIn their talks, Kennedy and Gabbard highlighted Bitcoin’s values and importance as a tool against governmental overreach.

Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the market trend for ETH is bullish, with indicators such as increasing open prices, transaction sizes, and total value transferred pointing towards a positive trajectory. The MACD signal on a buy trend further supports this bullish sentiment.

However, the news analyst report paints a contrasting picture, highlighting a recent decline in the cryptocurrency market due to various negative factors such as regulatory scrutiny, geopolitical tensions, and market uncertainties. The bearish sentiment in the market is further exacerbated by the recent price drops in Bitcoin and Ether.

Despite the recent market volatility and negative news, the overall bullish trend in ETH and positive market indicators suggest that the market is likely to continue on an upward trajectory in the long run.

The company emphasized that Bitcoin transactions can have tax implications, making the downloaded information valuable for future reference.

BingX sponsored the conference, had a booth activation and held a private party during their "User Appreciation Month" to commemorate their 5th anniversary with a focus on giving back to the community for their continued support over the years.\n\nThe Bitcoin 2023 conference is instrumental in fostering growth, not only among the most prominent cryptocurrency, but the greater digital-asset industry as well. Roughly 15,000 people gathered this year to discuss themes such as monetary policy, disrupting traditional banking, greater global policies, Bitcoin ecosystem growth, among many other ideas.

Five years is truly commendable and we look forward to continuing our journey to onboard the next billion crypto users. It will take the support and hardwork of the whole industry to accomplish this goal. It was incredible to see attendants still focused and working hard growing the greater cryptocurrency ecosystems, even during a market downturn."\n\n"The most exciting exchange to witness was the presence of both Web2 and Web3 companies.

This groundbreaking development marks a critical milestone in the exponentially growing Bitcoin ordinals ecosystem that is now reaching half a billion dollars in total market capitalization in less than six months.\n\n#USD is a BRC20 standard stablecoin created via the Bitcoin ordinals protocol which was introduced in January 2023 after the recent Taproot upgrade. BRC20 tokens use a technique called ordinal inscriptions to attach data to individual satoshis, the smallest unit of a bitcoin. These satoshis can then represent anything from digital art ownership to “meme coins” and even stablecoins.\n\nAccording to Stably, every #USD token is backed 1-to-1 with USD held by a US-regulated custodian in a collateral account for the benefit of KYC/AML-verified token holders. Monthly reports for the account are also conducted by a third-party stablecoin attestor to ensure #USD tokens are always fully collateralized with USD.\n\n"When I met Domo, the creator of the BRC20 standard, at the Bitcoin 2023 conference in Miami, I told him about our upcoming plans for #USD," said Kory Hoang, Stably’s CEO and Co-Founder. “He thought it was great and funny how we are creating a stablecoin on Bitcoin to enable Bitcoin trading on-chain… With a stablecoin built on Bitcoin. I’m still chuckling about it to this day, actually. In just one week after that, however, we made it happen!”\n\nThe integration of BRC20 #USD into the Bitcoin network is part of Stably’s mission to power the next billion Web3 users with a seamless fiat-to-crypto and stablecoin onramp to all popular and emerging blockchain networks. The company’s upcoming collaborations with prominent ordinals and BRC20 projects, including UniSat–the world’s largest decentralized wallet/marketplace for ordinals–and Ordzaar–Asia’s first decentralized ordinals marketplace project, reflect Stably\'s aspiration to drive global innovation and adoption toward decentralized finance on the Bitcoin network, or “BitFi.” Additionally, Stably’s engineers are now exploring the new ORC20 standard for Bitcoin ordinals, which could significantly enhance the token properties of #USD once implemented.\n\nStory continues\n\n#USD can be issued/redeemed with Fedwire, SWIFT, USDC, and USDT by KYC-verified users across 200+ countries/regions currently, including up to 44 US states. Stably states that it is employing a manual process of issuance/redemption for #USD’s initial launch but plans to release support for automatic issuance/redemption through its Stably Ramp widget during Q3 2023. By then, users of #USD will be able to on/off-ramp via more traditional payment methods like ACH, instant ACH, and credit/debit cards, in addition to bank wires.\n\nFounded in 2018, the 20+ team member Seattle FinTech is backed by leading institutional and angel investors in the crypto space, such as Morgan Creek Capital, BEENEXT, 500 Startups, Hard Yaka, CREAM Labs, Sunny Lu of VeChain, and Paul Stahura of Donuts, Inc. The company has raised over $7.5-million in total funding to-date, $5-million of which was collected during its last Pre-Series A round in December 2021. Stably has also expanded its fiat on/off-ramp and stablecoin natively to more than 10 emerging networks, including Arbitrum, XRP Ledger, Stellar, Tezos, VeChainThor, Harmony, Polymesh, Coreum, ICON, and Chia Network.\n\nAbout Stably\n\nStably is a Web3 payment infrastructure provider and FinCEN-registered MSB from Seattle. The company specializes in providing stablecoins and fiat <> crypto on and off-ramps to users of Web3 applications. Stably’s mission is to power this decade’s next billion Web3 users with regulatory-compliant payment infrastructure across both developed and emerging blockchain ecosystems.\n\nVisit stably.io to learn more.\n\nRisk Disclaimer: Digital assets involve significant risks, including (but not limited to) market volatility, cybercrime, regulatory changes, and technological challenges.

The news articles indicate mixed developments in the cryptocurrency market. The closure of Bottlepay's Bitcoin payment app may lead to some selling pressure as users withdraw their funds, potentially impacting Bitcoin prices. On the other hand, the launch of Stably's #USD stablecoin on the Bitcoin network could bring more stability and liquidity to the market, potentially attracting more investors and boosting trading volumes. Additionally, BingX's sponsorship of the Bitcoin 2023 conference and celebration of its 5th anniversary demonstrate continued interest and investment in the cryptocurrency space, which could contribute to a positive market sentiment. Overall, the market trend may experience some short-term volatility due to the Bottlepay closure but could see long-term growth with the introduction of new stablecoin options and ongoing industry events and developments.

Considering the current bullish trend for ETH and the positive outlook for the cryptocurrency market, it is recommended to focus on long-term strategies and risk management. Therefore, I would take a trading action with a confidence level of 0.8, indicating a strong belief in the bullish market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.
ACTION:
0.8
DAILY RETURN:
0.013727037136687992
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the overall market trend for ETH is bullish, with the MACD signal consistently indicating a buy trend. The fluctuating open price of ETH around $27,000 is accompanied by positive indicators such as increasing transactions and general positive sentiment in the market. Additionally, the news analyst report highlights positive developments in the cryptocurrency market, such as regulatory efforts and potential trading plans in Hong Kong, which could contribute to a positive market trend for ETH.

Reflecting on the recent trading performance, it is evident that prioritizing on-chain analysis and long-term strategies has been effective in maximizing profitability, with a confidence level of 0.8 in buying ETH. While short-term uncertainties and market volatility have led to occasional losses, a moderately conservative trading approach has been successful in managing risks effectively.

Considering the synthesized reports, the clear market trend for ETH appears to be bullish in the long term, supported by positive indicators and developments in the cryptocurrency market. Therefore, a more conservative trading approach is warranted to navigate potential volatility and maximize long-term gains.

Based on the above analysis, I would recommend a trading action of 0.7, reflecting a high level of confidence in the bullish market trend for ETH and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.

REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the market trend for ETH is bullish, with indicators such as increasing open prices, transaction sizes, and total value transferred pointing towards a positive trajectory. The MACD signal on a buy trend further supports this bullish sentiment.

However, the news analyst report paints a contrasting picture, highlighting a recent decline in the cryptocurrency market due to various negative factors such as regulatory scrutiny, geopolitical tensions, and market uncertainties. The bearish sentiment in the market is further exacerbated by the recent price drops in Bitcoin and Ether.

Reflecting on the recent trading performance, it is clear that a balanced approach combining elements of aggressive and conservative strategies is necessary to maximize profitability while managing risks effectively. Long-term strategies based on on-chain analysis and positive market trends seem to be more reliable than short-term gains.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is important to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains. Despite the recent market volatility and negative news, the overall bullish trend in ETH and positive market indicators suggest that the market is likely to continue on an upward trajectory in the long run.

Additionally, the verifychain RPC will now return false if checks couldn\'t be completed at the desired depth and level, providing more accurate feedback.\n\nThe release also includes changes to the build system, updated settings and new features. For instance, the shutdownnotify option allows users to specify a command to execute before Bitcoin Core begins its shutdown sequence. In the wallet section, new options like minconf and maxconf have been added to various RPCs, providing greater control over UTXO confirmations.\n\nBitcoin Core 25.0 introduces several improvements and optimizations, enhancing the user experience and security of the software.

The entire network runs on miners and nodes: computers that run Bitcoin software and work to keep the network secure.\n\nThese miners and nodes decide on any upgrades to the network by a vote, completely free of any third party. These upgrades can range from bug fixes or feature changes to even hard forks, where the entire network splits!\n\nHowever, coordinating upgrades and achieving community consensus across a big blockchain network like Bitcoin takes work. That’s where Bitcoin improvement proposals or BIPs come in.\n\nBitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIPs) allow community members to vote on protocol decisions in an organized way, even without centralized leadership.\n\nBut what are Bitcoin improvement proposals, and how do they work? If you want to understand the Bitcoin protocol, understanding the role of BIPs in the Bitcoin community is crucial. Let’s dive in!\n\nWhat Is a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP)?\n\nA Bitcoin Improvement Proposal, or BIP, is a technical document that proposes changes, ideas, or enhancements to the core Bitcoin blockchain. These BIPs can range from general community guidelines to major changes to the protocol. However, each BIP usually focuses on making one key change to the blockchain. If you want to know how Ethereum processes similar changes, check out our article on what an EIP is.\n\nHow Do Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) Work?\n\nBIPs are the driving force behind the continuous evolution of the Bitcoin protocol, shaping the chain’s future. Let’s look at the creation and approval process.\n\nHow are Bitcoin Improvement Proposals Created?\n\nSince Bitcoin is an open-source protocol, anyone can propose a BIP by submitting an informal proposal to the Bitcoin developers’ mailing list.\n\nSo how does that work?\n\nWell, firstly, Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) authors collect initial community feedback and vet the idea. Then, once the author has reasonable confidence in the idea’s potential, they send a draft BIP to the mailing list.\n\nHere, the community discusses the idea and fleshes out the core points for and against the proposal. Proposal rejections are common at this stage, especially if there are obvious conflicts or duplicate BIPs. However, some proposals can also stay in the discussion stage for years if there is no consensus, for example, the Block size debate.\n\nIf the community agrees that the idea holds merit, the proposal gets a BIP number and becomes a BIP document. Then, BIP editors take up the task of making sure everything is accurate. The BIP moves from the “informal” stage to the “official” proposal at this stage.\n\nIt’s important to note that the BIP is not yet approved for development. Think of this as the filing and pre-trial stage of a lawsuit in court, when all of the details are written up, and the community feels the idea needs to be discussed more.\n\nThe community also publishes it to the Bitcoin Core Github repository of BIPs — a collection of all Bitcoin Proposals proposed so far.\n\nHow Are BIPs Approved?\n\nTo become part of the Bitcoin protocol, the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) must achieve consensus among the community. To do that, it undergoes thorough review and analysis by the developers and the broader Bitcoin community. This includes the potential benefits and drawbacks, pros and cons, and the overall time investment.\n\nIf there are any necessary code changes, developers also start testing and implementing the code. This process can be long and complicated.\n\nThe community rejects the BIP if the developers find the code is bad or introduces challenges that can’t be resolved. Or, if everything looks okay, the community will begin implementing and activating it.\n\nTypes of Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs)\n\nBIP approval process depends majorly on its type. There are three types of BIPs: Standards Track, Informational, or Process BIPs. Let’s look at each of them and what they entail.\n\nStandards Track BIPs\n\nStandards Track BIPs are proposals that change the aspects of the protocol — transaction or block validation or encoding schemes. In the case of hard forks when the chain splits into two, Standard BIPs ensure interoperability between the legacy Bitcoin chains and the new ones. Since these BIPs involve significant code changes, they require community consensus.\n\nInformational BIPs\n\nInformational BIPs share knowledge and insight into Bitcoin’s upcoming plans.

Recent data shows a steep rise in USDT on the TRON network throughout 2023 so far.\n\nThe biggest losses among cryptocurrencies this week were posted by Internet Computer (ICP), which fell 6% to $4.88, and Lido DAO (LDO), which dropped 7.1% to $1.96.\n\nRon DeSantis Banned CBDCs in Florida—These States Could Be Next\n\nCoin politics\n\nCrypto is already a major talking point in Bitcoin-friendly Florida Governor Ron DeSantis’s campaign as he gets ready to run as the GOP’s candidate in next year’s U.S. presidential elections.\n\nDeSantis headlined an otherwise disastrous Twitter Spaces the day he announced his candidacy and told his host, Twitter/Tesla CEO Elon Musk, that Biden’s administration “[has] it out for Bitcoin, and if it continues for another four years, they’ll probably end up killing it.”\n\nOn Tuesday, The International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) released a report outlining policy recommendations for global crypto regulation as part of the public consultation process.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn a nod to the fall of FTX, the IOSCO recommendations warn regulators about crypto companies "combining certain functions in a single legal entity or group of affiliated entities,” such as one entity running exchanges, trading firms, and custody businesses under one roof.\n\nOn Thursday, watchdog the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) released a report concluding that the industry’s economic impact is minimal, but advising vigilance and policymaking that monitors leveraged trading and the industry’s financial contagion risks.\n\nThat same day, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and National Competent Authorities (NCAs) issued a statement saying that cryptocurrencies must be clearly labeled as unregulated and both investors and investment firms should understand the financial risks involved in trading them.'}, {'id': 10, 'time': 'Sat, 27 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Crypto hater Peter Schiff to drop Bitcoin Ordinals NFT art collection - Cointelegraph', 'content': 'In what seems like a parody but isn’t, economist, gold proponent and vocal crypto skeptic Peter Schiff has unveiled a collaborative nonfungible token (NFT) art collection on the Bitcoin network that will soon go up for auction.\n\nThe reaction from the crypto community has been mixed, with people generally baffled, amused or welcoming — especially Ordinals proponents — with some keen to point out the apparent hypocrisy.\n\nits a hack right?\n\n\n\ndid i just teleport to a different timeline?\n\n\n\nim so confused — Deezy (@CryptoDmack) May 26, 2023\n\nFor years, Schiff has actively bashed crypto — especially Bitcoin (BTC) — at any chance, with his arguments revolving around BTC being a Ponzi scheme with no inherent value.\n\nDespite all of that, Schiff unveiled the “Golden Triumph” NFT collection in a May 27 Twitter thread in collaboration with one of his “favorite artists,” who goes by the pseudonym “Market Price.“\n\n“This collaboration features the original painting ‘Golden Triumph’ as well as a series of prints and Ordinals inscribed on the Bitcoin blockchain,” he wrote.\n\nGolden Triumph consists of one physical painting on an oil linen canvas depicting a human hand holding a bar of gold, 50 prints on archival paper depicting the same image, and 50 digital versions inscribed as Ordinal NFTs on Bitcoin.\n\nThe collection will be sold via a two-part auction starting on June 2 and ending on June 9.

This groundbreaking development has ignited fervent debate within the Bitcoin community, injecting a fresh dimension into the digital currency. So, what exactly are ordinals? Why are they causing such a stir? And what implications could they hold for the future of Bitcoin?\n\nTo fully grasp the significance of ordinals, let’s start with a basic understanding of Bitcoin’s structure. As most Bitcoin enthusiasts are aware, each Bitcoin is composed of 100 million satoshis, or SATs. Ordinals, however, revolutionise this notion by enabling the individual transmission of SATs with the option to attach supplementary data. This data can take various forms, ranging from text and images to videos. This process of associating data with SATs is known as inscription. Impressively, over 100,000 inscriptions have already been created since the inception of ordinals earlier this week.\n\nThe name “ordinals” stems from the protocol’s unique approach to numbering sets based on the order of their mining. Among these 100,000-plus inscriptions, notable examples include ordinal punks and ordinal penguins. Given the Bitcoin and broader crypto communities’ proclivity for embracing and expanding on novel ideas, it is only reasonable to anticipate an influx of innovative and derivative concepts etched onto SATs. Crucially, these advancements have been made possible by the recent major upgrade to Bitcoin known as Taproot, which was implemented in late 2021.\n\nBut are these ordinals akin to NFTs (non-fungible tokens) on the Ethereum platform? The answer is both yes and no. While some distinctions can be drawn between ordinals and the familiar NFTs, the comparison holds merit. It is worth noting, however, that NFTs rely on smart contracts and often have their underlying assets hosted elsewhere, whereas ordinals are directly inscribed onto individual sets within blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the press release accompanying their launch, as cited in Bitcoin magazine, it was emphasised that “ordinals are fully on-chain and do not require a side chain or separate token. Inscriptions inherit the simplicity, immutability, security, and durability of Bitcoin itself.” Furthermore, Casey Rodimore, the creator of ordinals, elucidated in an interview with Decrypt that “the ordinals protocol is just a system for numbering satoshis, giving individual sets a serial number, and then tracking them across transactions.”\n\nEssentially, ordinals have unveiled a new use case for the Bitcoin network, extending its utility beyond the mere transfer of value. Inscribed sets now compete for block space alongside regular BTC transactions, leading to an increase in network fees. While this might not sound ideal, it is crucial to remember that these fees serve as vital incentives for miners to secure the network. As block rewards diminish over time, network fees will inevitably become the primary reason for committing hash power to Bitcoin. In this context, ordinals contribute additional functionality to Bitcoin.\n\nAccording to Glassnode, ordinals have not only propelled the number of non-zero Bitcoin addresses to a record high of 44 million but have also ushered in a novel and unique chapter in Bitcoin’s history. This innovation generates network activity without necessitating the classical transfer of coin volume for monetary purposes. Consequently, the user base has expanded, exerting upward pressure on the fee market beyond the conventional investment and monetary transfer use cases.\n\nHowever, not everyone in the Bitcoin community agrees with this innovation. Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream and about as OG as they come, sees ordinals as a “frivolous waste of block space” and objects to “the sheer waste and stupidity of an encoding” that does not do anything efficient. This disagreement sums up the divide in the Bitcoin community, with some fervent and non-toxic Maxis like Adam and others believing that Bitcoin’s relative simplicity and limitations to storing and transferring value should be preserved at all costs, while more progressive voices argue that Bitcoin needs to adapt in order to thrive and survive.\n\nThis fundamental argument is unlikely to be resolved anytime soon, but one thing is for sure: ordinals are generating a lot of attention and debate within the Bitcoin community. This is a welcome change from the FUD that has been clouding the industry, and we can expect to hear more about ordinals and their impact on Bitcoin in the months and years to come.\n\nThe author is vice-president, WazirX\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn'}, {'id': 9, 'time': 'Sat, 27 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "You Can Earn Bitcoin by Playing Mobile Solitaire Games—Here's How Much - Decrypt", 'content': 'Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe play-to-earn gaming craze might have faded, but believe it or not, there remains a slew of crypto-infused games out there that let you earn Bitcoin while you play—and you don’t have to buy any NFTs to get started.\n\nSolitaire is one of the most popular games to be injected full of Bitcoin rewards on iOS and Android, with no fewer than three competing takes that let you stack sats (or satoshis, a.k.a. 1/100,000,000 BTC) while stacking digital playing cards: THNDR Games’ Club Bitcoin: Solitaire, Bling Financial’s Bitcoin Solitaire, and Viker’s Solitaire - Card Game 2023.\n\nAll three games are broadly similar, serving up a simple game of digital solitaire that’s chock-full of obnoxious video ads. But all three games also truly do let you earn Bitcoin along the way and then withdraw it to a wallet. Keep your expectations in check, however: we’re talking pennies’ worth of BTC across hours of gameplay.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd I’d know, because I played approximately two hours of each game to see how much Bitcoin I could earn from each. Here’s a brief review of each game (played on iPhone), along with a verdict on which Bitcoin solitaire app is most worth your time and attention.\n\nClub Bitcoin: Solitaire\n\nTHNDR Games makes an array of Bitcoin-awarding mobile games, including Tetro Tiles, and its Club Bitcoin: Solitaire (iPhone, Android) is by far the most visually appealing of the bunch. It spruces up this very traditional card game with a little bit of visual panache, and the streamlined interface with one tap to send any card to its rightful pile feels intuitive and responsive.\n\nBut it’s stingy with the sats. You earn tickets while playing, and those are put into prize draws that could earn you large-to-small bundles of satoshis. But after two hours of total gameplay, I’d only earned 59 sats… that’s less than $0.02 worth. Plus, you have to redeem the sats and withdraw them to a wallet within a few days, otherwise they disappear.\n\nClub Bitcoin: Solitaire by THNDR Games. Image: Decrypt\n\nClub Bitcoin was the most enjoyable of the trio in terms of look and feel, but also provided the least amount of rewards. Your mileage may vary, however. No matter how it shakes out, you’ll still have to sit through some truly laborious video ads for scammy-looking mobile games.\n\nBitcoin Solitaire\n\nBling Financial is another publisher with a heap of crypto-tinged mobile games, and Bitcoin Solitaire (iPhone, Android)—created with PlayDay Studios—was by far the most generous game of this trio when it comes to earning satoshis.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGranted, it’s all relative: after two hours of play, I had earned enough “Bling Points” to withdraw 339 satoshis, or about $0.09 worth. That’s still basically nothing, but it’s more than five times the amount of Bitcoin that I earned while playing Club Bitcoin, with a similar amount of obnoxious ads permeating the experience.\n\nBitcoin Solitaire by Bling/PlayDay. Image: Decrypt\n\nBling’s Bitcoin Solitaire has a more spartan design than Club Bitcoin, but the interface is just as responsive and it serves up an enjoyable game of mobile solitaire. I noticed that I won a lot more games in Bitcoin Solitaire than the other two games, though. It feels tuned to go easy on you, but when you’re coasting to victory and racking up sats, it’s tough to complain.\n\nSolitaire - Card Game 2023\n\nThere’s an odd discrepancy between the iPhone and Android versions: the iOS game has the bland title above, while the Android one has “Earn Bitcoin” in the title. But appearances are a bit deceiving here, as both games may ultimately earn you tiny amounts of Bitcoin.\n\nIn this case, Viker’s take on solitaire is solid but not quite as streamlined as the others. A double tap is required on any card to send it to its rightful destination, which makes the flow a bit less speedy than in the other games, and the interface—which includes a banner ad—isn’t nearly as punchy and stylish as in Club Bitcoin.\n\nSolitaire - Card Game 2023 by Viker. Image: Decrypt\n\nAll that said, this is a totally solid game of smartphone solitaire, with just about the same amount of clunky, time-consuming, full-screen video ads as the others. And overall, the payout puts this game right in the middle of the others—I earned 122 satoshis in approximately two hours of gameplay, coming out to just over $0.03 worth of BTC.\n\nWhich should you play?\n\nAfter earning less than $0.15 total for six full hours of gameplay, it’s fair to say that none of these games are likely to grant you any meaningful amount of cryptocurrency. If you care about solitaire gameplay most of all, then you can probably find a mobile rendition with more polish and less-intrusive ads.\n\nBut among games with crypto rewards, Bling’s Bitcoin Solitaire hits the sweet spot. It’s not the most stylish-looking of the bunch, but the gameplay is smooth and enjoyable and I earned t...'}]

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter a tumultuous 2022, bitcoin has increased more than 60% year-to-date and the cryptocurrency market\'s total value sits well above the $1 trillion mark.\n\nThe industry has seemingly gotten back on its feet since the downfall of Sam Bankman-Fried\'s FTX in November, along with a slew of other industry bankruptcies including centralized lender Celsius, brokerage Voyager Digital, and hedge fund Three Arrows Capital earlier in the year.\n\nWhile it can be hard to predict bitcoin\'s moves, experts told Insider there are a few things to watch for this year to get a sense of where the world\'s largest cryptocurrency is headed.\n\nFirst, bitcoin can\'t claim another all-time until the macroeconomic environment clears up, Charmyn Ho, head of crypto insights at digital asset exchange Bybit, told Insider. The crypto traded at a record of $67,566 in November of 2021, per Messari.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n"However, a possible headwind is the potential recession forecast to hit the US, Europe, and other major economies due to a stubbornly inverted yield curve," Ho told Insider. "Couple this with a bunch of other unsavory macro factors — such as inflation — many investors would rather remain on the sidelines."\n\n"This is contributing to the mostly sideways price action we\'ve been experiencing," Ho added.\n\nA key technical event for Bitcoin\'s network, the halving, could push the token\'s price up significantly though. Although the halving is estimated to occur in April of 2024, Ho says bitcoin may go on a tear leading up to the event.\n\n"Bitcoin halvings are significant because they slash the production of new bitcoins on the network by half," Ho said. "This curtails the supply of freshly minted coins, thus leading to a price increase if the demand persists."\n\nAdvertisement\n\n"Litecoin, which is due for its halving this year, is up around 90% since its lows in Q3, 2022," Ho said. "Therefore, if we take that as a guide, it is possible that we could see a similar 90% move from Bitcoin\'s Q3, 2023 price, which would give a rough target of about $60,000."\n\nJagdeep Sidhu, president of Syscoin Foundation, expressed similar optimism around the halving.\n\n"While we\'ve weathered some storms recently, the resilience of the crypto ecosystem remains evident. From the ashes of FTX, the market has rebounded, demonstrating its inherent capacity to absorb shocks and evolve," Sidhu told Insider.\n\n"As we approach the next Bitcoin halving and crypto dominance looks set to peak, we\'re on the cusp of exciting developments in the crypto world."\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf inflation cools in the US and there\'s regulatory clarity around digital assets, another crypto exec told Insider that bitcoin could hit $38,000 by year-end, a 41% increase from its current trading level.\n\n"My base case is bitcoin will trade in a range to a range between $25,000 and $32,000 for the remainder of 2023," Tim Shan, COO at decentralized crypto exchange Dexalot, said. "But if we see inflation remain high, I think bitcoin could trade back down to lows of the year."\n\n"The short to medium term driver is still inflation, and specifically US inflation. I think core inflation has been pretty sticky but will continue to decline in the US, leading the Fed to pause for the rest of the year," Shan added.\n\nDavid Uhryniak, who works on ecosystem development at blockchain infrastructure provider TRON, is confident that bitcoin will finish the year "significantly higher" and could close out 2023 at over $35,000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n"Right now, smart traders are waiting for greater validation as to which way bitcoin and the rest of the market will move next before committing serious money," Uhryniak told Insider. "By Q4, much of the uncertainty that\'s clouded the market all year should have abated. Things like concerns over the Mt. Gox coins being liquidated or the US government selling its stockpile of BTC confiscated from black markets."'}, {'id': 5, 'time': 'Sun, 28 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Bitcoin back above US$28,000 as cryptos rebound on positive debt ceiling talks - Yahoo Finance', 'content': 'Bitcoin moved back above US$28,000 in Monday morning trading in Asia, leading a rally among all top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies. Ethereum broke through the resistance ceiling of US$1,900. The gains followed an in-principle agreement between U.S. President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin Mccarthy to raise the country’s debt ceiling, which boosted investors’ appetite for risk assets.\n\nCrypto\n\nBitcoin rose 3.98% over the last 24 hours to US$28,195 at 9:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. It recorded a weekly gain of 5.73%, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world’s largest cryptocurrency moved above US$28,000 for the first time since May 10.\n\nEther jumped 3.48% in the past 24 hours to US$1,916, moving up 6.53% over the past seven days. It was trading above the US$1,900 mark for the first time in three weeks.\n\nCryptocurrency prices received a boost after U.S. President Biden on Saturday said he had reached an in-principle agreement with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy to raise the government’s debt ceiling, which averts the threat of a default in the world’s biggest economy. If ratified, the agreement would run through Jan. 1, 2025.\n\nBoth parties are now urging U.S. Congress to pass the deal by June 5 – the deadline set by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. The talks had rattled investors for weeks as a debt default in the U.S. could have caused panic in global markets.\n\nThe sense of relief among investors that a deal is on the verge of completion has led to “fresh buying of risk assets,” said Markus Thielen, Head of Crypto Research & Strategy at digital asset service platform Matrixport, in a note shared with Forkast.\n\n“So many investors were scared about the debt ceiling and the potential default by the U.S. government – which is just so unlikely. Now, they need to find something else to be bearish about while the market likely rallies,” said Thielen.\n\nWith Bitcoin taking the lead, all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded higher over the past 24 hours. The total market cap for cryptocurrencies rose 3.00% in that period to US$1.17 trillion. The 24-hour trading volume also jumped 57.01% to US$31.73 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nNeo, the token that supports China-affiliated Neo blockchain, saw the largest weekly gain in the top 100 cryptocurrencies. It rose 23.83% to US$11.37. Neo is backed by Onchain, a Chinese blockchain company and member of the country’s internet finance industry lobby.\n\nNeo outperformed most other larger-cap cryptocurrencies in the past week with investors now “positioning themselves for the Hong Kong opening event,” said Thielen of Matrixport.\n\nHong Kong will unlock trading for retail investors from June 1, as the city seeks to become a hub for the crypto industry.\n\nBitcoin NFT sales surge\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index edged up 0.57% to 3,373.39 in the 24 hours to 11:20 a.m. in Hong Kong, but is still down 0.82% for the past seven days.\n\nNFT sales on Ethereum dipped 8.07% in the past 24 hours to US$13.10 million, according to CryptoSlam data. In contrast, NFT sales on the Bitcoin network surged 95.50% to US$8.29 million.\n\n$OXBT BRC-20 NFTs, a Bitcoin NFT collection launched last Thursday, saw its sales exceed US$3 million in the past 24 hours, or more than 35% of all the NFT sales on the Bitcoin blockchain. The collection has attracted over 34,000 owners in four days.\n\nData from CryptoSlam indicates a rapid rise of Bitcoin in the NFT space, said Yohann Calpu, Chief Marketing Officer at Forkast Labs.\n\n“I have never seen an ecosystem boot up this fast, except for NFTs in 2020-2021, and I would argue that it’s even moving faster this time around,” said Calpu. He added that the Ethereum and Bitcoin networks are competing for NFT supremacy, with Bitcoin protocol potentially better suited for NFT projects “that see immutability and scarcity as features instead of weaknesses.”\n\nPeter Schiff, Euro Pacific Capital Chief Economist and vocal Bitcoin critic, said on Saturday he had collaborated in an art project to launch 50 Ordinal inscriptions – the Bitcoin blockchain’s iteration of NFTs – on the Bitcoin blockchain, which will be open for bidding in an auction in early June.\n\n“Seeing Peter Schiff convert makes me happy,” tweeted Binance Chief Executive Officer Changpeng Zhao on Sunday.\n\nElsewhere, Our Force 1, the NFT sneaker collection launched by sportswear Giant Nike last Wednesday, has seen sales exceed 75,000 in five days to around US$1.48 million, giving each NFT sneaker a price of US$19.82, according to data from PolygonScan.'}, {'id': 1, 'time': 'Sun, 28 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Marc Andreessen on A.I., Bitcoin, and Billionaires - Reason', 'content': 'Marc Andreessen has helped a lot of people get rich—including Marc Andreessen. He\'s made millions of people\'s lives more fun, more efficient, or just a little weirder while making himself into a billionaire.\n\nHe is the co-creator of the first widely used web browser and co-founder of the venture capital powerhouse Andreessen Horowitz. Though he hates the term unicorn—industry lingo for a private tech firm valued at more than a billion dollars—he\'s a famously successful unicorn wrangler: He was an early investor in Facebook, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Twitter, Lyft, and more.\n\nAndreessen is also aggressively quotable, whether it\'s his classic 2011 pronouncement that "software is eating the world" or his more recent "There are no bad ideas, only early ones." And in 2014 he said, "In 20 years, we\'ll be talking about bitcoin the way we talk about the internet today." A born bull, Andreessen is an optimist who places his hope for the future squarely in the hands of "the 19-year-olds and the startups that no one\'s heard of."\n\nAs splashy artificial intelligence such as ChatGPT and DALL-E begin to permeate our daily lives and the predictable panic revs up, Reason Editor in Chief Katherine Mangu-Ward sat down with Andreessen in February for a video and podcast interview about what the future will look like, whether it still will emerge from Silicon Valley, Friedrich Nietzsche, and the role of government in fostering or destroying innovation.\n\nReason: I tend to be skeptical of people who claim that this time it\'s different, with any tech or cultural trend. But with artificial intelligence (A.I.), is this time different?\n\nAndreessen: A.I. has been the fundamental dream of computer science going all the way back to the 1940s. There were five or six A.I. booms where people were really convinced that this time is the time it\'s going to happen. Then there were A.I. winters in which it turns out, oops, not yet. For sure, we\'re in another one of those A.I. booms.\n\nThere are a couple of things that are different about what\'s happening right now. There are these very well-defined tests, ways of measuring intelligence-like capabilities. Computers have started to do actually better than people on these tests. These are tests that involve interactions with fuzzy reality. So these aren\'t tests like, "Can you do math faster?" These are tests like, "Can you process reality in a superior way?"\n\nThe first of those test breakthroughs was in 2012, when computers became better than human beings at recognizing objects in images. That\'s the breakthrough that has made the self-driving car a real possibility. Because what\'s a self-driving car? It\'s basically just processing large amounts of images and trying to understand, "Is that a kid running across the street or is that a plastic bag, and should I hit the brakes or should I just keep going?" Tesla\'s self-driving isn\'t perfect yet, but it\'s starting to work quite well. Waymo, one of our companies: They\'re up and running now.\n\nWe started to see these breakthroughs in what\'s called natural language processing about five years ago, where computers started getting really good at understanding written English. They started getting really good at speech synthesis, which is actually quite a challenging problem. And then most recently, there\'s this huge breakthrough in ChatGPT.\n\nChatGPT is an instance of a broader phenomenon in the field called large language models, or LLMs. A lot of people outside the tech industry are shocked by what that thing can do. And I\'ll just tell you, a lot of people inside the tech industry are shocked by what that thing can do.\n\nChatGPT does feel, to those of us who don\'t fundamentally understand what\'s going on, like a little bit of a magic trick. Like Arthur C. Clarke\'s third law: "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." And sometimes it really is a trick. But you\'re saying this is something real?\n\nWell, it\'s also a trick. It\'s both. There\'s a profound underlying question: What does it mean to be smart? What does it mean to be conscious? What does it mean to be human? Ultimately, all the big questions are not, "What does the machine do?" Ultimately, all the big questions are, "What do we do?"\n\nLLMs are basically very fancy autocompletes. An autocomplete is a standard computer function. If you have an iPhone, you start typing a word and it will offer you an autocompletion of the rest of that word so you don\'t have to type that whole word. Gmail has autocomplete now for sentences, where you start typing a sentence—"I\'m sorry I can\'t make it to your event"—and it will suggest the rest of the sentence. What LLMs are is basically autocomplete across a paragraph. Or maybe an autocomplete across 20 pages or, in the future, maybe an autocomplete across an entire book.\n\nYou\'ll sit down to write your next book. You\'ll type the first sentence, and it will suggest the rest of the book. Are you going to want what it suggested? Probably not. But it\'s go...'}]

This event reduces the amount of new Bitcoin created and earned by miners by half. The halving is part of Bitcoin’s “monetary policy,” encoded in its software, to control inflation by reducing the rate at which new Bitcoin enters circulation.\n\nHow Bitcoin Halving Works\n\nWhen Bitcoin was first introduced in 2009, the reward for miners was 50 Bitcoins per block. After the first halving in 2012, this reward was reduced to 25 Bitcoins per block. The second and third halvings, in 2016 and 2020 respectively, further reduced the reward to 12.5 and then 6.25 Bitcoins. This trend will continue until all 21 million Bitcoins have been mined, which is estimated to occur around the year 2140. After that, miners will be compensated with transaction fees.\n\nWhy Mine Bitcoin At All\n\nMining Bitcoin, a process where transactions are verified and added to the public ledger, called the blockchain, can offer several potential benefits. Here’s why someone would consider mining Bitcoin:\n\nFinancial Rewards: One of the primary reasons individuals mine Bitcoin is for the potential financial rewards. Bitcoin miners are rewarded with Bitcoin itself. Given its value (hovering at roughly $25,000 currently per coin), even mining a fraction of a Bitcoin can yield a considerable financial return. The Bitcoin rewards can either be held as an investment (anticipating future price increases) or sold for immediate cash. Supporting the Bitcoin Network: Bitcoin mining plays an essential role in securing the Bitcoin network. The process of mining involves solving complex mathematical problems to validate transactions. This process ensures the integrity and security of the Bitcoin network, preventing double-spending and maintaining the decentralized nature of the system. Entry into the Cryptocurrency Space: Bitcoin mining offers an entry point into the broader cryptocurrency and blockchain technology world. It’s a hands-on method of learning about how blockchain technology works and understanding the intricacies of cryptocurrencies. Potential for Increased Value: If the price of Bitcoin rises, miners could make substantial profits. When Bitcoin’s price increases, the value of the rewards also increases. Given the historical performance and growing mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin, some miners choose to hold onto their coins with the hope that they will be worth more in the future. Independent Income: For those willing to invest in the necessary hardware and who have access to cheap electricity, Bitcoin mining can be a form of independent income. Once the initial investment in equipment is covered, miners can continue earning Bitcoin as long as they can cover the ongoing costs of electricity. Advancement in Tech Knowledge: Mining Bitcoin can be a fascinating hobby for tech enthusiasts. It provides the opportunity to learn about advanced computer hardware, software, and networking.\n\nHowever, it’s crucial to note that Bitcoin mining is not for everyone. It requires substantial upfront investment in specialized hardware, and the cost of electricity can be high. Moreover, the difficulty of mining Bitcoin increases over time, meaning that the potential rewards decrease unless you continually upgrade your equipment. Therefore, it’s important to research thoroughly and understand the financial and technical implications before embarking on a Bitcoin mining venture.\n\nWhy Bitcoin Halving Occurs\n\nBitcoin halving serves several key purposes:\n\nControlled Supply and Scarcity: Bitcoin’s inventor, Satoshi Nakamoto, designed Bitcoin with a maximum supply of 21 million coins to maintain its scarcity, mimicking the supply rate of commodities like gold. Halving ensures the steady, predictable release of new Bitcoins into the economy. Inflation Control: By reducing the rate at which new Bitcoins are created, halving controls inflation. The decrease in supply can increase demand, potentially driving up the price. This deflationary measure distinguishes Bitcoin from traditional fiat currencies, which often depreciate over time due to inflation. Miner Incentives: Miners play a critical role in maintaining and securing the Bitcoin network. The block reward, though periodically halved, provides an incentive for miners to continue their work. Over time, as the block reward decreases, transaction fees become a more significant portion of miners’ income, ensuring the network’s long-term sustainability.\n\nThe Implications\n\nBitcoin halving can significantly impact the cryptocurrency’s price and the broader crypto economy. In the past, halvings have often led to price increases due to the reduced supply of new coins and increased demand. However, these events also introduce uncertainty, as the reduced mining reward can lead to decreased mining activity if miners find the endeavor less profitable.\n\nFor Bitcoin holders, halving represents a moment of potential opportu...'}]

The company said it will launch a Bitcoin mining arm in Uruguay, a country that generates 94% of its electricity from renewable sources such as wind and solar. On top of that, the stablecoin issuer said it will also invest in Uruguay's energy production industry and hire more team members to support its expansion.\n\nThe move is part of Tether's treasury management strategy, which involves investing up to 15% of its net profit in Bitcoin. Previously, Tether revealed it held about $1.5 billion in Bitcoin, which accounts for around 2% of its total reserves. Tether said it aims to minimize the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining through the use of renewable energy sources, while also adding to the security of the Bitcoin network."}, {'id': 5, 'time': 'Tue, 30 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Stablecoin giant Tether to mine bitcoin in Uruguay using renewable energy - CNBC', 'content': 'A picture taken in London shows gold-plated souvenir cryptocurrency tether, bitcoin and ethereum coins arranged beside a screen displaying a trading chart, May 8, 2022.\n\nCryptocurrency giant Tether is setting up a bitcoin mining operation in Uruguay using renewable energy, as the company looks to diversify the revenue mix to support its USDT stablecoin.\n\nThe company said Tuesday that it plans to invest its resources into renewable energy production, marking its first foray into the energy sector.\n\nTether added it is also on the hunt for "experts in the area" to support its expansion into the renewable energy space. Mining bitcoin is notoriously power-intensive, relying on a distributed network of computers around the world to verify that transactions are legitimate and release new coins into circulation.\n\n"By harnessing the power of Bitcoin and Uruguay\'s renewable energy capabilities, Tether is leading the way in sustainable and responsible Bitcoin mining," said Paolo Ardoino, CTO of Tether.\n\n"Our unwavering commitment to renewable energy ensures that every Bitcoin we mine leaves a minimal ecological footprint while upholding the security and integrity of the Bitcoin network."\n\nEarlier this month, Tether said it would shift its treasury management strategy to start investing a portion of its net profit in bitcoin.\n\nThe company committed to use up to 15% of its net profit to purchase bitcoin, mimicking strategies from businesses such as Tesla and MicroStrategy .'}, {'id': 24, 'time': 'Tue, 30 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Bitcoin: crypto backers hope scarcity can solve everything - Financial Times', 'content': 'Print this page\n\nThe days of Bill Clinton appearing on stage at cryptocurrency conferences and Matt Damon starring in crypto exchange ads are long gone. Speculative mania has given way to more sober reflection. In the US, the energy usage of miners is under fresh attack. The White House has suggested that mining companies pay tax equal to 30 per cent of the cost of electricity they use.\n\nDespite this, the price of bitcoin has climbed 67 per cent this year, exceeding $30,000 in April before falling back. Ethereum, the second- largest digital token, is following the same trajectory. It may be less than half its high point, but the pause on interest rate rises has lifted bitcoin’s price. A technical event known as the halving could drive it higher still.\n\nThere will only ever be 21mn bitcoin in circulation. Every four years, rewards for mining bitcoin are chopped in half. Right now, miners receive 6.25 bitcoin for verifying a new block of transactions on the blockchain. Next year this will drop to 3.125. Eventually the reward will be cut to $0. The lead-up to previous halvings has coincided with bitcoin price rises.\n\nIt is possible, however, that dwindling enthusiasm for the crypto industry will damp the halving’s impact. Venture capital funding for crypto and blockchain start-ups dropped 80 per cent in the first quarter of the year compared with the same period in 2022, according to data from PitchBook. Excitement around artificial intelligence that has lifted prices in semiconductor companies and other tech stocks has not extended to crypto companies. Regulator warnings have made banks more skittish about holding their assets after FTX’s failure.\n\nBitcoin was created in the wake of the financial crisis as a decentralised alternative. But the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank this year did not trigger renewed conversion to bitcoin. Lack of transparency remains a problem. So does criminal activity.

Congress is set to vote on the legislation as early as Wednesday.\n\n"The past few days have shown strong volatility as BTC dropped to the lowest trading price of about $25,800 Wednesday due to investors\' fear concerning [the] U.S. reaching the debt ceiling," said Matteo Greco, research analyst at investment firm Fineqia International.\n\nBitcoin and ether roared higher the following day.\n\n"However … This means that, in the mid-term, money is removed from more risky assets to buy government bonds.

Therefore, it is crucial to focus on the bullish long-term trend of ETH and adopt a moderately conservative trading approach to manage risks effectively.

Considering the synthesized reports and the emphasis on long-term strategies, I would take a slightly conservative approach and assign a trading action of 0.3, reflecting moderate confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.

It was an immediate red flag."\n\nFrom \'Bitcoin Billionaires\' to SEC Charges: A Brief Crypto History of the Winklevoss Twins\n\nFears grew for the welfare of the 49-year-old, a father of seven, when his wallet, passport, and briefcase were found in his unlocked car near a 90-acre aquatic park. Dr. Forsyth\'s cell phones were also abandoned inside an RV he often parked outside the hospital so he could be close to his patients.\n\nSearches by law enforcement had spanned a nine-mile radius—with loved ones desperately appealing for information on his whereabouts.\n\nSouth African Crypto Founders Vanish, $3.6 Billion Allegedly Missing\n\n"My brother has now been missing for a week.

Bitcoin recorded the day’s largest loss, followed by Litecoin. XRP stood out as the sole gainer.\n\nSee related article: Weekly Market Wrap: Bitcoin weighed down by debt ceiling uncertainty\n\nBitcoin, Ether down, along with all cryptos except XRP\n\nBitcoin fell 1.81% from 10:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong to US$27,163. The afternoon slump positioned the world’s largest cryptocurrency as the greatest loser among the top 10 cryptocurrencies over the past 24 hours, experiencing a 2.31% loss. Litecoin followed closely, falling 2.27% to US$89.51.\n\n“Bitcoin needs to overcome the US$28,000 big figure. It’s weekly candle has to close above US$28,000 to be bullish,” said Johnny Louey, a crypto research analyst at trading platform LiquidityTech Protocol.\n\nEther fell 1.31% to US$1,870 since 10:00 am, falling under the psychological benchmark of US$1,900.\n\nXRP was the only token in the green among the top 10 cryptos, rising 0.91% to US$0.5074 after leading yesterday’s gains. The coin started picking up momentum after pro-Ripple attorney John Deaton tweeted on Sunday, that the court will make public internal documents from 2018 showing former Securities and Exchange Commission director William Hinman saying sales of Ether tokens were not securities transactions, which could undermine the regulator’s case against Ripple Labs. The U.S. securities watchdog sued the San Francisco-based payments firm in December 2020, claiming that XRP was a security and that Ripple had conducted unregistered securities transactions by selling the cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin, Ether NFT sales up\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index inched up 0.02% to 3,412.59 points in the 24 hours to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong while rising 1.0% during the week.\n\nStory continues\n\nBitcoin’s secondary non-fungible token (NFT) sales rose 5.42% to US$4.6 million in the past 24 hours. Interest in Bitcoin NFTs is surging, after the new BRC-721E token standard was launched on Monday. The token standard allow Ethereum-native ERC-721 NFTs to be permanently transferred to Bitcoin, where they become BRC-721E tokens.\n\nThe launch of the new Bitcoin-based token standard has pushed the Milday Maker NFT collection to the top 10 for daily sales. Originally founded on Ethereum, Miladay Maker participated in the creation of the BRC-721E token standard.\n\nEthereum’s 24-hour NFT sales rose 10.25% to US$19.1 million, boosted by Bored Ape Yacht Club, which rose 1.32%, generating US$2.6 million in sales for the network. Sales for Opepen Edition NFTs also rose 79.15% to US$868,963.\n\nAmong Forkast Labs NFT indexes, the Forkast CAR NFT Composite was the only one to decrease, falling 2.07% to 1,019.54 points.

Japan’s Nikkei 225 experienced a 1.41% decrease, while the Shanghai Composite inched down 0.61% and the Shenzhen Component Index dipped 0.70%.\n\nConcerns over China’s economic recovery impacted investor sentiment, as the country’s manufacturing purchasing managers’ index fell to a five-month low in May. The data suggests that factory activity contracted more rapidly than anticipated due to diminishing demand, leading to the offshore yuan depreciating to US$7.12 per dollar, its lowest value in six months.\n\nU.S. stock futures were also red as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, as investors awaited updates on the U.S. debt ceiling deal. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 0.15%, the S&P 500 futures index inched down 0.18%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures weakened by 0.18%.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy reached a preliminary deal on Sunday, that would suspend the debt ceiling until after the presidential election in 2024. While the bill passed through the House rules committee by a 7-6 margin on Tuesday, it still needs approval from the full House, which is set to vote on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the Treasury Department moved the date at which the U.S. would reach its borrowing limit to June 5.\n\nThe U.S. dollar index rose 0.33% to 104.5 points on Wednesday, on track for a monthly gain of nearly 3%. Meanwhile, the euro fell 0.53% to US$1.06, its lowest since March 17.\n\nSee related article: Hong Kong Solidifies Crypto Regulations even as Malaysia bears down on Huobi\n\n(Update edits headline, ad...'}, {'id': 61, 'time': 'Wed, 31 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "How Low Will Bitcoin Go? Dogecoin Turning Bullish And Big Eyes Coin's Journey To Pioneering Innovations - Yahoo Finance", 'content': 'In the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, new concepts and trends are continuously emerging, piquing the curiosity of both investors and crypto enthusiasts. One aspect attracting attention is the meteoric rise of cryptocurrency itself, particularly meme tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE), and the eagerly anticipated Big Eyes Coin (BIG). The cryptocurrency community is now experiencing a level of excitement that has never been seen before.\n\nUnveiling The Cryptic Chessboard: Bitcoin’s Fate Hangs In The Balance\n\nBitcoin markets showed modest gains as traders sought stability above $28,000, reaching a two-week high of over $28,450. Short-term profit-taking sentiment pushed the price lower to around $27,850. However, Bitcoin remained up about 10% from its recent low of $26,000 on May 25. The gains were fueled by optimism around the U.S. averting a default after an agreement to raise borrowing limits. The weakened U.S. dollar contributed to Bitcoin’s rise, with a potential rally to $31,000 in June, representing a 10% increase from current levels.\n\nGlassnode’s Checkmate study highlights the significant impact of short-term holders (STH) on Bitcoin’s trajectory. Metrics like STH-MVRV, STH-SOPR, and profit/loss ratios are closely monitored. Inactive holders hinder price objectives, while active participation inspires confidence. STH’s actions carry substantial influence, shaping the market. Analysts track these metrics diligently, expecting retracements in the 2023 bull market. Bitcoin bulls must showcase unwavering dedication to price increases. Ultimately, market players collectively shape Bitcoin’s path forward.\n\nDogecoin’s Meme Magic: From Viral Phenomenon To Bullish Potential\n\nThe original meme coin, Dogecoin, captivated the crypto community with its appeal to online culture and celebrity endorsements. It swiftly garnered popularity and a devoted group after being influenced by the well-known Doge meme. Dogecoin gained acceptance as a payment option on websites like Reddit and Twitch despite having little practical purpose.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen examining its recent activity, Dogecoin made a breakout from a bullish falling wedge but then retracted. A double-bottom pattern with significant buying pressure, however, formed and suggested probable bullishness. A positive short-term prognosis is further supported by the wave count and RSI readings. Fibonacci retracement levels indicate that $0.087 to $0.091 could act as resistance during a pullback. However, a price decline below $0.069 would continue the bearish trend and can result in a price of $0.050.\n\nBig Eyes Coin: Weaving Utility To Meme Coins\n\nBe prepared for an exciting show as Kitty Cuddlers gets ready for the highly anticipated Big Eyes Coin presale finale on June 3. As a result of the brave foray into the world of online casinos and P2E adventures that have enchanted the public, hearts are racing in anticipation of the grand launch on June 15, 2023. A gripping shift is coming for BIG with the thrilling return of the Stage 3 price of $0.00017. Everyone will be on the edge of their seats as a result of the frenzy of interest and anticipation this comeback will generate.\n\nThe ERC-20 cryptocurrency Big Eyes Coin emerges as a pioneer in the decentralized exchange (DEX) industry with its ground-breaking platform, BIG Swap. Prepare yourself for a tsunami of excitement. From the beginning, this innovative company has enchanted its customers with unique products like the captivating BIG Loot Box Trading Cards and alluring promo codes that promise a plethora of advantages. The meme coin has accomplished a great deal by raising an incredible $46 million during its initial coin offering (ICO) and is currently just $5.5 million away from meeting its audacious $51.5 million hard ceiling. The story of BIG has never ceased to enthrall and astound, igniting the passion of both investors and enthusiasts.\n\nBIG has established a vibrant, adorable community. BIG was able to successfully establish itself in the midst of the glut of Doge-themed meme coins, demonstrating to the world that we could carve out a unique niche for ourselves without following the crowd. Additionally, BIG has created its very own online BIG casino, which will exclusively benefit our devoted BIG holders.\n\nBig Eyes Coin will also grow to be a top Play-to-Earn project in the web3 and cryptocurrency sectors! In light of all of this, the moment has come to take advantage of this presale! There is no turning back now that $BIG could sell out at any second! Buy Big Eyes Coin immediately because once $BIG is gone, these low prices are never coming again!\n\nThe Final Say\n\nThe fate of Bitcoin remains uncertain, influenced by short-term holders and market dynamics. Dogecoin shows bullish potential, while Big Eyes Coin’s presale finale sparks excitement in the decentralized exchange industry.

On May 18, pseudonymous conceptual artist OONA sold a loaf of bread to a collector for 0.5 BTC, or just over $13,400 worth.\n\nThe sale was not a trick or a gag. The loaf was real, perishable country bread. It was really sold to a man, Vladimir Kravets, who did in fact pay thousands of dollars for it.\n\nIn fairness, the loaf—made in partnership with Bitcoin NFT marketplace DIBA—was unlike other grocery store varieties, as it contained a hardware wallet that stored an undisclosed amount of BTC. But neither the artist nor Kravets plan to disclose the amount.\n\nThat may be because the actual value of "Bit.Bread," as the piece is titled, has nothing to do with money itself. As with OONA’s previous works, it instead investigates the perception of value, particularly as that perception pertains to gender—an often fraught subject in the male-dominated crypto industry.\n\n“It fundamentally investigates the ways in which this technology is more progressive than the people that use it,” OONA told Decrypt of "Bit.Bread."\n\nSince 2021, OONA has created works of performance art at crypto conferences, always sporting glasses and a draped mask that conceals her identity. Her work has focused on the treatment and perception of women in crypto, and the ways in which crypto—a technology the artist believes can financially and politically liberate and empower people of all backgrounds—has emerged within a culture that she believes does not adequately respect or include women.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt Art Basel Miami last December, OONA, with the help of performance artist Lori Baldwin, auctioned off a cup of her own breast milk—milked live in front of a large audience—before being escorted away by conference security. The piece, "Milking the Artist," received a high bid of $200,000.\n\nThey\'re both part of a progression of performance art activations, as detailed in a recent blog post by OONA, including tokenizing and auctioning off butter that she had churned. It\'s a juxtaposition between the "permanent" and "perishable," as she describes it.\n\nThat piece and "Bit.Bread" both riff on edible symbols of the kitchen, in an effort to interrogate the value placed on women in crypto-related environments. That value is typically minimal, and often reduced to sexualization and objectification, according to the artist.\n\nOONA (left) alongside an unidentified actor hired for the performance. Image: Alejandra Bernal\n\nWhat’s more, the degree of crypto-specific sexism that OONA has repeatedly, personally encountered has generally risen with the tide of crypto prices and speculative frenzy.\n\n“At the 2022 Avalanche Summit, I was asked what my hourly rate was at least five times, because people assumed that I was a prostitute,” OONA recounted. “Going back this year, most conversations were about my performance art.”\n\nSame thing at Bitcoin Miami: Last year, during the waning days of the bull market, OONA said that she had to repeatedly fight off men intent on trying to rip off her mask to reveal her face. This year, in the doldrums of the bear market, such an invasion of her artistic and physical privacy never once occurred.\n\nMinted by Dance: Inside Art Blocks\' Latest Immersive Digital Art Collection\n\nIn that sense, "Bit.Bread" can be interpreted as a reflection on the relationship between speculation and gender. So far, crypto’s speculative excesses have typically encouraged a hyper-masculine subculture, one personified by the “crypto bro” stereotype.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean speculation is itself harmful, according to OONA. On the contrary, speculation is at the heart of Bitcoin’s promise as a tool and value system that she believes will hopefully, eventually, lift up people of all backgrounds.\n\n“I wanted to connect speculation around the value of women with speculation around Bitcoin,” she said, adding that both "involve a new set of knowledge, a new way of interacting, and a new way of perceiving self-sovereignty.”\n\nEditor\'s note: This article was updated after publication to correct the date that the bread was sold.'}, {'id': 45, 'time': 'Thu, 01 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'What is a Bitcoin Rainbow Chart? - Nasdaq', 'content': 'It’s no secret that the cryptocurrency market is volatile. Since the price of Bitcoin tends to rise and fall dramatically, investors are always looking for a tool to streamline making efficient investment choices.\n\nThe Bitcoin Rainbow Chart is one of the many tools invented to create an easy visual guide to investing in this cryptocurrency. As the price of Bitcoin rises and falls, the rainbow chart is designed to help investors determine the appropriate times to buy and sell their tokens. It also allows you to compare Bitcoin’s current price to historical trends.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart and how you can efficiently build your investment portfolio.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nThe Bitcoin Rainbow Chart reflects a logarithmic growth curve.\n\nThe chart uses various colors to highlight good times to buy or sell Bitcoin.\n\nAlthough a helpful visual, investors should look beyond the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart when making investment decisions.\n\nWhat is a Bitcoin Rainbow Chart?\n\nThe Bitcoin Rainbow Chart is a tool that investors use to assess the current value of the cryptocurrency in relation to the big picture. Within the chart, you’ll see a rainbow of colors that reflects a logarithmic growth curve, which investors use as a mathematical tool to forecast the possible future price of Bitcoin.\n\nWhen looking at the rainbow chart, you’ll also see the price of Bitcoin over time. Notably, the chart’s designers didn’t want daily fluctuations in price to throw off its data. Instead, the chart ignores the noise of market movements throughout the day to focus on the overarching Bitcoin price trends.\n\nWhy is Bitcoin so Volatile?\n\nBitcoins are produced through a process called mining. Miners are nodes in Bitcoin’s network that solve complex computational math problems to earn the next “block” of Bitcoins. Mining has a dual purpose: minting new Bitcoins that enter circulation and auditing the blockchain the make sure all transactions are valid and no double-spending is occurring.\n\nBecause Bitcoin mining requires robust hardware and significant energy, it’s costly, slow, and only sometimes financially rewarding. Still, it has attracted considerable interest in recent years because of the decentralized nature of the Bitcoin blockchain and its status as a kind of modern precious metal.\n\nUnlike the gold standard or fiat currency, Bitcoin is a new and mostly untested currency. It’s not used in most people’s everyday lives and has yet to be accepted by most retailers and vendors as a legitimate form of payment.\n\nBitcoin is volatile because its price is dependent on supply and demand. The price will swing depending on how many Bitcoins are in circulation, how much people are willing to pay for the tokens, and how close the currency is to its 21 million Bitcoin limit.\n\nThis limit was purposefully put in place by Bitcoin’s inventor so miners couldn’t keep minting coins to the point of causing wild price fluctuations. Hype for Bitcoin in the media or negative press can also lead to volatile Bitcoin prices. For example, some experts argued the recent collapse of Silicon Valley Bank led to increased interest in cryptocurrency products, pushing up the price of Bitcoin.\n\nWhat happened to Bitcoin’s price in 2022?\n\n2022 was a particularly volatile year for economies worldwide. Inflation in the United States led to the Federal Reserve instituting a series of aggressive rate hikes, which made borrowing more expensive to reduce discretionary spending. As rates increased, they damaged corporate profits, and many tech companies laid off thousands of employees.\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine also led to widespread economic uncertainty last year. Energy prices skyrocketed, particularly in Europe, as access to Russian energy sources became limited.\n\nBitcoin saw its price fall from over $60,000 at the end of 2021 to under $20,000 at the end of 2022. The collapse of FTX in November 2022 marked a particularly low point for Bitcoin, as investor confidence in the speculative asset seemed low.\n\nHowever, the price of Bitcoin has since rebounded and is seeing positive growth in 2023. As inflation and rate hikes ease up, consumers are starting to spend more and feel more comfortable putting money toward something as risky as Bitcoin.\n\nWho Created the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart?\n\nThe Bitcoin Rainbow Chart hit the scene when a Reddit user, Azop, introduced the chart to track the price of Bitcoin. The chart is meant to predict future market trends without the distractions of daily market volatility.\n\nHow Does the Chart Work?\n\nThe chart superimposes the price of Bitcoin onto a rainbow. Since the logarithmic growth curve intends to forecast the future price of Bitcoin, different colors are intended to highlight the prime opportunities for buying or selling it.\n\nIn general, investors use this chart as a long-term valuation tool. But the predictions made within the rainbow chart aren’t necessarily accurate. It’s simply one way to assess Bitcoin’s current pri...'}]

"""
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, the ETH market is currently uncertain and volatile, with fluctuating open prices, average fees, total size used, and total value transferred. The MACD signal has been alternating between buy and sell, indicating indecision among traders.

The news analyst report highlights various developments in the cryptocurrency market, including Bitcoin trading at a discount on Binance Australia, the listing of VERSE token on Kucoin, and preparations for the Bitcoin halving event in April 2024. These developments suggest short-term volatility and long-term growth potential in the cryptocurrency market.

The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of balancing short-term risks with long-term opportunities in trading ETH. It suggests a moderately conservative trading approach to navigate potential market uncertainties and optimize long-term gains.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing short-term volatility but has long-term growth potential. Therefore, it is advisable to focus on long-term strategies over short-term gains to maximize profitability.

Based on this analysis, I would take a trading action with a confidence level of 0.7, indicating a moderately confident decision to buy ETH for long-term investment, considering the potential for growth in the market despite short-term fluctuations.
ACTION:
0.7
DAILY RETURN:
-0.0016072970774935191
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the ETH market is currently experiencing fluctuations with a potential bearish bias in the short term. The decrease in average transaction fees, fluctuating total value transferred, and the MACD signal switching to a sell all point towards uncertainty and a possible shift in market trend. However, the increasing number of unique addresses and coinbase transactions indicate growing interest and adoption of ETH in the long term.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights positive developments in the cryptocurrency industry, such as Tether's move towards sustainable practices and Saifedean Ammous's appointment in El Salvador, which could boost investor confidence in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Reflecting on the reports, it is clear that while short-term market trends may be uncertain, prioritizing long-term strategies and monitoring key indicators like on-chain analysis and news developments can lead to maximizing profitability in the ETH market. Therefore, it is crucial to focus on the bullish long-term trend of ETH and adopt a moderately conservative trading approach to manage risks effectively.

Considering the synthesized reports and the emphasis on long-term strategies, I would take a slightly conservative approach and assign a trading action of 0.3, reflecting moderate confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.
ACTION:
0.3
DAILY RETURN:
-0.017405084777227908
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently volatile and indecisive, with potential for both bullish and bearish movements. The decreasing average fees suggest an increase in trading activity, while the inconsistent total value transferred indicates uncertainty in market sentiment. The MACD signal switching between buy and sell further highlights the lack of clear direction in the market.

The news analyst report adds to this by mentioning the recent decline in the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin and Ether facing challenges. However, there is optimism for a potential rally in Bitcoin and continued interest in other cryptocurrencies like XRP, Dogecoin, and Big Eyes Coin. Despite short-term fluctuations, the market trend seems to have potential for growth and innovation.

Reflecting on these reports, it is evident that a long-term trading strategy based on on-chain analysis and key news developments is crucial for maximizing profitability in the ETH market. While short-term fluctuations may lead to losses, focusing on the bullish long-term trend of ETH and closely monitoring short-term indicators can help manage risks effectively.

In conclusion, the overall market trend appears to have potential for growth and innovation in the near future. Therefore, it is advisable to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains. With a moderately conservative trading approach, traders can capitalize on the long-term growth potential in the cryptocurrency market.

Based on this analysis, I would take a trading action with a confidence level of 0.5, indicating a neutral stance in the market and a balanced approach to managing risk and potential opportunities.

To some extent, when measuring for risk-adjusted returns over the long-term, that argument holds water, as there are several high potential cryptos better than Bitcoin worth considering.\n\nHowever, not all investors are looking at crypto with the same investing time horizon or frame of reference. Over the near-term, a number of other top tokens have performed very well, and may outperform these top two cryptos over time.\n\nAmidst the backdrop of a domestic banking crisis and looming concerns over a U.S. debt default, investors are increasingly considering cryptocurrencies as potential safe haven assets to navigate the economic challenges ahead. This shift in thinking marks a significant departure from just six months ago when the prevailing belief was that the “crypto winter” would persist well into 2023.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut, the question arises: Are there any genuinely secure cryptocurrencies to invest in at present? If so, which ones should investors consider adding to their portfolios this month? Here are three cryptos on the top of my list of projects that could potentially outperform Bitcoin and Ethereum over the next 2-3 years.\n\nSymbol Cryptocurrency Price XMR-USD Monero $145.68 AVAX-USD Avalanche $14.44 SOL-USD Solana $20.50\n\nMonero (XMR-USD)\n\nA concept coin for Monero (XMR) has a sparkly gold background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIntroduced in 2014, Monero (XMR-USD) is a decentralized cryptocurrency and blockchain network that prioritizes privacy. With its advanced features like stealth addresses and ring signatures, Monero ensures user anonymity. Nonetheless, this commitment to privacy has also attracted heightened regulatory attention globally. This makes it one of those high potential cryptos better than Bitcoin.\n\nMonero is a leading privacy coin, offering complete anonymity and untraceability for its blockchain transactions. By employing advanced technology, Monero conceals the sender, recipient, and transaction amount, providing a high level of privacy. Encapsulating its ethos, with its motto “secure, private, untraceable,” Monero has garnered global user appeal. The rising demand for privacy coins has propelled XMR’s price up by 16% over the past six months.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother key point is that despite regulatory and legislative scrutiny due to its potential involvement in illicit activities like international money laundering, Monero remains popular among users who are undeterred by such criticisms. The usage and value of XMR have consistently increased, with a remarkable 76% rise since 2017. Crypto enthusiasts believe that the ongoing regulation of cryptocurrencies will further drive users toward the privacy provided by Monero, indicating promising prospects for continued growth.\n\nMonero relies on Proof-of-Work for decentralized consensus and offers private, secure, and untraceable transactions through an opaque blockchain. With a default privacy setting, Monero utilizes ring confidential transactions, ring signatures, and stealth addresses. As a fungible and secure digital currency, Monero prioritizes user privacy, leading to a promising future ahead.\n\nAvalanche (AVAX-USD)\n\nGraphic of various cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum resting on a United Kingdom Union Jack flag\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/rawf8\n\nAvalanche (AVAX-USD) started May 2023 on a bullish note, trading at $16.66. Despite the bears maintaining a price of $14 since May 18, Avalanche is now edging toward the $15 mark, aiming to regain its positive price trend. The surge in trading volume indicates increased activity on the network.\n\nRecently, Avalanche has established significant support at the $14.29 price level, acting as a pivotal point for the asset. Currently, it is trading above this immediate resistance level. However, the presence of bearish market forces persists, aiming to prevent AVAX from surpassing the next resistance level at $15.21. Despite its bearish nature in the short-term, it’s still one of those high potential cryptos better than Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the integration of the Ethereum Virtual Machine sets Avalanche apart as a favored platform. Developers can now create decentralized applications on a broader scale while leveraging the advantages of a faster and more economical blockchain. The Avalanche Bridge further enhances convenience and accessibility by facilitating seamless asset transfers across multiple blockchains.\n\nThe bottom line is that Avalanche stands out as a superior choice in terms of security compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Its unique feature of subnets allows the creation of both private and public blockchains, adding versatility to its network. With practical applications in the real world, Avalanche exhibits immense potential for value and growth.

(Nasdaq: CLSK), America’s Bitcoin Miner™, today released its unaudited bitcoin mining and operations update for the month ending May 31, 2023.\n\n“We achieved a significant milestone during the month of May,” said Zach Bradford, CEO. “Not only do we continue to increase the amount of bitcoin in our treasury, but we also surpassed $100 million in revenue for our fiscal year to date. Importantly, we achieved this milestone with the bulk of our expansion expected to come later this year.\n\n“Additionally, the amount of bitcoin we mined this month exceeded expectations, largely due to increases in operational efficiency and a brief, albeit significant, increase in transaction fees. For about five days in May, fees were elevated because of increased interest in ordinals on the blockchain. At its peak, our bitcoin production jumped to nearly 30 bitcoins in a single day, almost double our normal daily production of about 18 bitcoins. Since then, transaction fees have normalized.”\n\nMay Bitcoin Mining Update (unaudited)\n\nBitcoin mined in May: 609\n\nCY2023 bitcoin mined: 3,004\n\nTotal BTC holdings as of May 31: 451\n\nTotal BTC converted for operations and growth in May: 471\n\nCurrently deployed fleet of about 67,196 latest-generation bitcoin miners with a hashrate of 6.7 EH/s\n\nThe Company funded growth and operations through the sale of 471 bitcoins in May 2023 at an average of approximately $27,400 per BTC. Sales of BTC equated to proceeds of approximately $12.9 million. May daily BTC mined averaged 19.6 and reached a high of 29.6, due to a brief period of unusually high transaction fees.\n\nOperational Updates\n\nWashington.

Many recall, at their lowest points, battling chronic depression and contemplating suicide.\n\nThe patients, all male, share harrowing stories of dealing with a newfangled addiction: compulsive crypto trading. Some say their crypto addiction combined with an alcohol or drug habit, while others say they began by treating trading digital tokens much like gambling.\n\n“I spent eight hours a day on Reddit reading [crypto] white papers, thinking I’m making an intellectual decision . . . it was just ridiculous,” said one patient.\n\nTheir plight goes to the heart of a dilemma for politicians around the world as they try to grapple with the impact of cryptocurrencies on their populations. Many lawmakers and companies are calling for it to be designated as a financial service, which would demand tough regulatory standards but offer consumers legal protections.\n\nIn an effort to establish London as a “hub” for financial markets innovation, the British government has set out a sweeping framework for crypto that would bring it into line with established regulations for financial services.\n\nBut in the UK last month a report from a powerful cross-party group of MPs said crypto should be regulated like gambling; people were trading assets that had “no intrinsic value” and “no discernible social good”, it said.\n\nFor those treating the 70-odd patients at the private Castle Craig rehab centre outside Edinburgh, the change in emphasis cannot come soon enough.\n\nCrypto addicts describe their experience “as any gambler would describe their gambling addiction”, said Anthony Marini, Castle Craig’s senior specialist therapist. “So, for me, should it be regulated as gambling? Absolutely.”\n\nMore than 300 patients suffering from a form of crypto addiction have come through Castle Craig’s doors since it opened up to crypto traders in 2018, calling itself the world’s first specialist crypto addiction centre.\n\nAll hands went up during the group session when Marini asked if any patients had experienced symptoms such as suicidal ideation, chronic depression or hopelessness.\n\n“There needs to be a health warning [on crypto exchanges] just like any gambling site,” Marini said. “People have lost families, people have lost their jobs, people have embezzled . . . there needs to be warnings and education that this can actually kill people.”\n\nCentral to the report from the Treasury select committee were concerns that handing oversight of crypto to the UK’s main markets regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, would give the impression that crypto is “safer than it is”.\n\n“I was seeing crypto more as an investment, so in my head I wasn’t gambling at first . . . but I don’t think it really works like that,” another gambling addict told the Financial Times.\n\nDuring the therapy session at Castle Craig, patients described using crypto trading apps that were built to encourage them to invest compulsively and chase a quick profit, echoing the rougher tactics of the early online betting industry, which has been tamed to some extent by more fines being meted out by the Gambling Commission.\n\nGaming companies are now compelled to offer customers access to self-exclusion technology, while crypto trading apps are not. UK online betting platforms will soon have to impose stake limits and conduct basic affordability checks on users, although how this will work is still subject to consultation.\n\nThe prospect of regulations that borrow from the gambling playbook would likely “cut against” the UK government’s ambitions to become a hub for the sector, argued Paige Berges, anti-corruption and international risk counsel at law firm Ropes & Gray.\n\nCrypto companies have also hit out at its findings, saying it underplays crypto’s potential benefits for the economy and consumers. British lobbying group CryptoUK calls the select committee report “not helpful”.\n\nTrading venue GFO-X said: “All investors — whether retail or institutional — deserve access to orderly markets which establish price discovery, in the same way as other financial instruments or commodities. The rhetoric around crypto assets being classed as gambling is extremely unhelpful and provides worse customer outcomes.”\n\nMoreover, the UK Treasury, responsible for developing the rules, has privately indicated it will not be swayed by the report.\n\n“Risks posed by crypto are typical of those that exist in traditional financial services and it is financial services regulation — rather than gambling regulation — that has the record in mitigating them,” said a recent email from the Treasury to the crypto industry and seen by the FT.\n\nBut there is growing evidence that the lines between crypto trading and gambling are blurred, and the worst consequences of overuse look strikingly similar.\n\nA 2019 study from researchers at Rutgers University that looked at 876 gamblers who bet at least once a...'}]

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the ETH market is currently experiencing fluctuations with a potential bearish bias in the short term. The decrease in average transaction fees, fluctuating total value transferred, and the MACD signal switching to a sell all point towards uncertainty and a possible shift in market trend. However, the increasing number of unique addresses and coinbase transactions indicate growing interest and adoption of ETH in the long term.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights positive developments in the cryptocurrency industry, such as Tether's move towards sustainable practices and Saifedean Ammous's appointment in El Salvador, which could boost investor confidence in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Reflecting on the reports, it is clear that while short-term market trends may be uncertain, prioritizing long-term strategies and monitoring key indicators like on-chain analysis and news developments can lead to maximizing profitability in the ETH market. Therefore, it is crucial to focus on the bullish long-term trend of ETH and adopt a moderately conservative trading approach to manage risks effectively.

Considering the synthesized reports and the emphasis on long-term strategies, I would take a slightly conservative approach and assign a trading action of 0.3, reflecting moderate confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.
ACTION:
0.3
DAILY RETURN:
-0.017405084777227908
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently volatile and indecisive, with potential for both bullish and bearish movements. The decreasing average fees suggest an increase in trading activity, while the inconsistent total value transferred indicates uncertainty in market sentiment. The MACD signal switching between buy and sell further highlights the lack of clear direction in the market.

The news analyst report adds to this by mentioning the recent decline in the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin and Ether facing challenges. However, there is optimism for a potential rally in Bitcoin and continued interest in other cryptocurrencies like XRP, Dogecoin, and Big Eyes Coin. Despite short-term fluctuations, the market trend seems to have potential for growth and innovation.

Reflecting on these reports, it is evident that a long-term trading strategy based on on-chain analysis and key news developments is crucial for maximizing profitability in the ETH market. While short-term fluctuations may lead to losses, focusing on the bullish long-term trend of ETH and closely monitoring short-term indicators can help manage risks effectively.

In conclusion, the overall market trend appears to have potential for growth and innovation in the near future. Therefore, it is advisable to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains. With a moderately conservative trading approach, traders can capitalize on the long-term growth potential in the cryptocurrency market.

Based on this analysis, I would take a trading action with a confidence level of 0.5, indicating a neutral stance in the market and a balanced approach to managing risk and potential opportunities.
ACTION:
0.5
DAILY RETURN:
-0.014470560085432238
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the market trend for ETH is bearish, with potential further price declines in the near future. The decreasing average transaction fees and fluctuations in total size used and total value transferred indicate volatility in the market. Additionally, the MACD signal consistently indicating a sell trend reinforces the bearish sentiment.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights a mixed sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, with various external events impacting the industry. While there are indicators of potential growth, such as the increased Bitcoin mining hash rate, there are also unique and volatile aspects, like the mysterious death of a prominent crypto figure and extravagant sales involving Bitcoin.

In reflection, it is clear that a focus on long-term strategies based on on-chain analysis and key news developments has been more successful in navigating the volatile ETH market. Short-term trends may be unpredictable, but by prioritizing monitoring on-chain analysis and key news developments, one can capitalize on potential growth and innovation in the cryptocurrency market.

Considering the synthesized reports, the clear market trend for ETH leans towards a bearish sentiment in the short term, with potential for growth in the long term. Therefore, a moderately conservative trading approach is warranted to manage risks effectively and optimize long-term gains.

Based on this analysis, I would take a slightly bearish stance and sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.3 to manage risks and align with the overall market trend.

Not to forget that it plans to build a full-fledged ecosystem just like Bitcoin. In this article, we will delve into the key aspects of both Bitcoin and Big Eyes Coin, analyzing their goals, mechanisms, and potential impact on the crypto space.\n\nBitcoin (BTC): Pioneer Of The Cryptocurrency Realm\n\nBitcoin, often referred to as BTC, stands as the pioneer of cryptocurrencies. Introduced by an anonymous entity known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, Bitcoin has gained immense popularity and market dominance. It operates on a decentralized network called blockchain, enabling peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries.\n\nWith a limited supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin holds significant value and serves as a store of wealth for many investors. Its decentralized nature, coupled with strong security protocols, attracts individuals seeking financial sovereignty and protection against inflation. Despite facing market volatility, Bitcoin has consistently rebounded and demonstrated resilience, fostering trust among its user base.\n\nThe BIG Bridge Between Memes, Community, And Sustainability\n\nBig Eyes Coin, on the other hand, takes a unique approach to the crypto industry. This meme-inspired cryptocurrency combines the allure of meme coins with a strong emphasis on community engagement and environmental conservation. The project revolves around Big Eyes, a cat with big eyes, who embarked on a global journey to raise awareness about ocean conservation and blockchain.\n\nBy leveraging non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and a crypto casino, Big Eyes Coin aims to create an ecosystem that fosters rapid growth while offering exclusive content and events to its community. Members are rewarded with tokens, NFTs, and early access to news and updates, promoting active participation and ownership within the ecosystem. Moreover, the project’s commitment to charitable causes further amplifies its appeal, resonating with individuals who seek meaningful investments.\n\nThe Showdown: Bitcoin Vs. Big Eyes Coin\n\nWhile Bitcoin and Big Eyes Coin operate within the same cryptocurrency realm, they have distinct features and objectives. Bitcoin, as the market leader, primarily focuses on establishing itself as a decentralized digital currency and a long-term store of value. Its limited supply and proven track record attract both institutional investors and individual enthusiasts seeking to secure their wealth.\n\nIn contrast, Big Eyes Coin positions itself as a community-driven meme coin with a strong emphasis on environmental protection and charitable causes. It aims to engage users through exclusive content and events, leveraging the appeal of its mascot – the Big Eyes cat. By combining meme culture with a purpose-driven approach, Big Eyes Coin seeks to capture the interest of meme coin lovers and investors looking for both entertainment and utility.\n\nAs Bitcoin faces its first monthly loss in 2023, it’s essential to explore alternative cryptocurrencies that offer unique value propositions. While Bitcoin remains a prominent player in the crypto market, Big Eyes Coin introduces an innovative approach by merging meme coin appeal with community engagement and environmental protection. Both Bitcoin and Big Eyes Coin cater to distinct audiences, each with its own investment preferences and objectives.\n\nBy examining the dynamics of these cryptocurrencies, investors and meme coin enthusiasts can make well-informed decisions, considering factors such as market trends, utility, and long-term sustainability. As the crypto industry continues to evolve, understanding the similarities and differences between cryptocurrencies becomes crucial for navigating this exciting and rapidly changing landscape.\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG)\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: Telegram: Contact @BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/BigEyesCoin/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/BigEyesCoin\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates'}, {'id': 21, 'time': 'Sat, 03 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Is Biden’s controversial Bitcoin mining tax dead or set to rise from the ashes? - Cointelegraph', 'content': 'Bitcoin (BTC) miners in the United States can breathe a sigh of relief after a proposed tax on crypto mining did not make it into a bill to raise the U.S. debt ceiling that appears set to pass.\n\nThe Digital Assets Mining Energy (DAME) excise tax proposal sought to charge crypto miners a tax equal to 10% of the cost of the electricity they used for mining in 2024, before scaling up to 30% in 2026.\n\nThe tax was highly controversial, with critics arguing that it had the potential to increase global emissions as a result of miners being forced to go overseas where countries may produce more emissions during energy production.\n\nAdditionally, Bitcoin miners seek out cheap energy, and as one of the cheapest sources of energy is excess renewable energy, Bitcoin miners can actually incentivize its production by providing utilities with a buyer for energy that would otherwise be wasted.\n\nThe news broke after Bitcoin miner Riot Platforms vice president of research Pierre Rochard noted on May 28 that the proposed bill did not include any mention of the DAME tax, which Representative Warren Davidson replied was “one of the victories” of the bill.\n\nYes, one of the victories is blocking proposed taxes. — Warren Davidson (@WarrenDavidson) May 29, 2023\n\nDead and buried or set to return?\n\nWhile much of the online discussion around the news suggested the proposal was “dead,” others, such as Coin Metrics co-founder Nic Carter, highlighted that it was only temporarily defeated, alluding to the possibility of it being included in future bills.\n\nBitcoin mining "DAME" tax defeated (for now)\n\n\n\nBiden CEA, specifically Heather Boushey, hold this L https://t.co/hJgZ7oUGub — nic carter (@nic__carter) May 29, 2023\n\nCarter suggested later in a May 29 Twitter thread that the administration would likely attempt to sneak it into some omnibus bill and would already have done so if it had the political currency to do so.\n\nBut bills are required to pass both through Congress and the House, and considering the Republican party is generally opposed to increases in taxes and currently controls the House, it seems unlikely such an omnibus bill would be able to make it to the president’s desk.\n\nWhile speaking to Chamber of Digital Commerce founder and CEO Perianne Boring during a May 20 fireside chat at the Bitcoin 2023 conference in Miami, Senator Cynthia Lummis assured viewers that the DAME tax “isn’t going to happen.”\n\nLummis added that ensuring Bitcoin mining firms remain in the U.S. was important for both national security and energy security, highlighting how Bitcoin mining can both reduce gas flaring emissions and help stabilize the energy grid.\n\nCointelegraph contacted the White House asking whether it planned to continue pursuing the DAME tax but did not receive a response.\n\nIs the damage already done?\n\nIn response to questions from Cointelegraph, Bitcoin miner Marathon Digital Holdings CEO Fred Thiel suggested that, regardless of whether President Joe Biden’s administration decides to keep pursuing the DAME tax, it will continue its anti-crypto agenda, saying:\n\n“I think it is clear that this administration will continue to broadly oppose the crypto sector, and even if this specific tax is no longer on the table, it is likely not the last of misguided, targeted efforts to bring this industry down.”\n\nMany from within the crypto industry and even some U.S. lawmakers agree with this take, arguing that, among other measures, the U.S. government is making a coordinated effort to discourage banks from working with crypto firms — aka Choke Point 2.0 — under the guise of ensuring the financial system remains stable and safe.\n\nWhen businesses make long-term decisions, they generally seek to reduce risk. So, given the choice of operating in a region with clear, crypto-friendly policies compared to one where regulations are unclear, and there is a greater potential for policies that hurt the competitiveness of U.S.-based activity, firms will generally choose the former.\n\nThiel highlighted how the actions of the U.S. government and regulators weigh in on business decisions while speaking to Cointelegraph, saying, “Regardless of the DAME tax’s likelihood of passing, Marathon has already begun diversifying the locations of our operations.”\n\nAsia Express: Yuan stablecoin team arrested, WeChat’s new Bitcoin prices, HK crypto rules\n\nThiel added that “with regulation around mining being so nebulous,” his firm has made the strategic decision not to concentrate its footprint in the U.S. but rather diversify its operations.\n\nHe pointed to a May 9 announcement from his firm, which said it would be building two new mining facilities in Abu Dhabi.\n\nAbu Dhabi is a region that has made a concerted effort to attract crypto-related investment via its clear regulatory regime, which has been hailed as pro-market.'}, {'id': 31, 'time': 'Sat, 03 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'How Long Does it Take to Mine 1 Bitcoin? - Bitcoin Australia', 'content': 'As a newcomer to the world of crypto, you may have heard about the process of Bitcoin mining and wondered how long it takes to mine 1 Bitcoin. In this blog post, we will delve into the fascinating world of Bitcoin mining, explore the inner workings of the Bitcoin network, and discover why Bitcoin mining remains an integral part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nTable of Contents:\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency that operates on a decentralised network, meaning it is not controlled by a central authority like a traditional bank or government. Instead, it relies on tens of thousands of computers around the world, known as nodes, to validate and secure transactions.\n\nThe Future of Bitcoin:\n\nAs the popularity of Bitcoin continues to grow, so does its value. Bitcoin prices have been known to fluctuate, with some experts predicting that one Bitcoin could be worth millions of dollars in the future. This potential for growth has captured the imagination of investors and enthusiasts alike.\n\nUnderstanding the Blockchain:\n\nThe blockchain is a public ledger that records all Bitcoin transactions, ensuring transparency and security. Each block in the chain contains a list of transactions, which are verified by miners before being added to the blockchain.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin Mining?\n\nBitcoin mining is the process of using powerful computers, called miners, to validate and secure transactions on the Bitcoin network. Miners compete to solve complex mathematical problems, and the first one to find the solution adds a new block to the blockchain, earning block rewards in the form of bitcoins.\n\nHow does Bitcoin Mining work?\n\nMiners earn rewards in two ways: block rewards and transaction fees. When a new block is added to the blockchain, the miner who successfully adds it receives a fixed amount of Bitcoins, known as the block reward. They also collect transaction fees from users who want to prioritise their transactions. While solo mining is possible, it is highly unlikely for a solo miner to successfully mine a block on their own. As a result, most miners join the largest Bitcoin mining pools to increase their chances of earning rewards.\n\nRisks of Bitcoin Mining:\n\nMining operations come with their own set of risks, such as the high electricity cost and the environmental impact of using non-renewable energy sources. Many crypto-mining facilities have started to explore renewable energy options, like solar or wind power, to reduce their carbon footprint.\n\nWhy Do Bitcoins Need to be Mined?\n\nThe mining process is essential for maintaining the integrity and security of the Bitcoin network. Without miners, transactions would be left unverified, and the decentralised nature of the network would be compromised.\n\nHow Long Does it Take to Mine 1 Bitcoin?\n\nThere are several factors that affect how long it takes to mine one Bitcoin. These include the mining hardware you’re using, the mining difficulty, and whether you’re part of a mining pool or operating solo. In general, it can take anywhere from several months to years for a mining operation to mine 1 Bitcoin, depending on these factors.\n\nMining Difficulty:\n\nAs more miners join the network and contribute their computing power, the Bitcoin network adjusts the mining difficulty to maintain a consistent rate of new blocks being added to the blockchain. The higher the mining difficulty, the more hash rate (or hashing power) is required to successfully mine a Bitcoin block. This means that as the network grows and more miners join, it becomes increasingly difficult for individual miners to compete and successfully mine a block.\n\nDifficulty of Bitcoin mining over the last 3 years (https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/difficulty)\n\nMining Hardware:\n\nThe type of mining equipment used can have a significant impact on how long it takes to mine one Bitcoin. High-performance mining hardware, such as Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC) miners, are designed specifically for mining and provide much greater computing power than traditional Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) miners. Consequently, miners with more powerful hardware have a higher chance of successfully mining a single block, reducing the time it takes to mine one Bitcoin.\n\nMining Pools:\n\nMining pools are groups of miners who combine their computing resources to increase their chances of mining a block. By working together, miners in a pool have a higher likelihood of finding a solution to the mathematical problem and receiving block rewards. The rewards are then split among the pool members according to the mining pool fees and their individual contributions. While mining pools increase the chances of success for miners, they also reduce the amount of Bitcoin each miner receives, potentially extending the time it takes to mine one Bitcoin.\n\nMining Software:\n\nEfficient mining software can help optimise mining performance, allowing miners to utilise more computing power and increase their chances of successfully...'}]

"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the market trend for ETH is bearish, with potential further price declines in the near future. The decreasing average transaction fees and fluctuations in total size used and total value transferred indicate volatility in the market. Additionally, the MACD signal consistently indicating a sell trend reinforces the bearish sentiment.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights a mixed sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, with various external events impacting the industry. While there are indicators of potential growth, such as the increased Bitcoin mining hash rate, there are also unique and volatile aspects, like the mysterious death of a prominent crypto figure and extravagant sales involving Bitcoin.

In reflection, it is clear that a focus on long-term strategies based on on-chain analysis and key news developments has been more successful in navigating the volatile ETH market. Short-term trends may be unpredictable, but by prioritizing monitoring on-chain analysis and key news developments, one can capitalize on potential growth and innovation in the cryptocurrency market.

Considering the synthesized reports, the clear market trend for ETH leans towards a bearish sentiment in the short term, with potential for growth in the long term. Therefore, a moderately conservative trading approach is warranted to manage risks effectively and optimize long-term gains.

Primarily targeting the environmental impact of the crypto industry, DAME as originally envisioned would have required all crypto miners in the United States to pay a tax equivalent to 30% of the cost of the electricity these companies use. Such a tax would not only be devastating to a business that relies on cheap power costs, but would also completely ignore the reality that a huge number of bitcoin miners today are reliant on renewable energy.\n\nHowever, this plan, and indeed all the White House’s proposals for economic functioning, have been dramatically hampered by the latest round of negotiation over the U.S. debt ceiling. In essence, without a vote of confidence from an embittered Congress, the federal government would have defaulted on its loans, creating a crisis for the dollar. To continue the normal functioning of the global reserve currency, a deal was reached in late May that largely focused on concessions over economic policy. It’s thanks to this deal that the DAME act seems well and truly shuttered.\n\nThe crypto community has generally reacted to this news with celebration, as some of the largest mining firms are seeing massive stock rallies on top of a year that has already been successful. For the moment, it does not seem like there is political will to carry out an attack on Bitcoin from this angle.\n\nJust because this plan has failed, though, does not mean that crypto miners are safe from similar taxes on other fronts. Considering that this proposal collapsed over the federal government’s spending, Bitcoiners should be wary of the White House’s arguments that the DAME tax would generate billions for federal coffers. In other words, it seems very likely that similar attacks on crypto mining will be proposed in the future, possibly in a reworked fashion to seem more economically valuable or otherwise accompanied by increased efforts to link crypto mining and climate change.\n\nFor now, DAME failed in the same month it was proposed, and the immediate threat to Bitcoin has passed. The speed of this victory should remind the world of how far cryptocurrency has come in the last few years; an economic maverick has seen enough acceptance within the halls of power that it now has no shortage of friends in the U.S. House and Senate. As the crypto industry continues to grow and represent economic freedom for millions of people worldwide, it seems safe to say that it’s smart to bet on Bitcoin.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.'}, {'id': 18, 'time': 'Mon, 05 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Bitcoin, Ether skid; BNB drops more than 10% after U.S. securities regulator sues Binance - Yahoo Finance', 'content': 'Bitcoin fell almost 6% and Ether lost 5% in a broad market fall by all top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies on Tuesday morning in Asia after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued cryptocurrency exchange Binance and its founder Changpeng Zhao on charges of securities violations.

The SEC also alleged that Binance did not register Binance.com as an exchange or a broker-dealer clearing agency.\n\nIn response to the SEC lawsuit, Binance said in a Tuesday statement that it intends to defend its platform “vigorously.”\n\n“The SEC’s refusal to productively engage with us is just another example of the Commission’s misguided and conscious refusal to provide much-needed clarity and guidance to the digital asset industry,” Binance said.\n\nCryptocurrencies traded on the Binance exchange, including BNB, BUSD, Solana, Cardano’s ADA, Polygon’s MATIC, are securities and require registration and regulation, according to the SEC suit.\n\nSolana dropped 9.52% over the past 24 hours, with ADA falling 7.73% and MATIC losing 7.64%.\n\n“The total crypto market cap is down,” Justin d’Anethan, head of APAC business development at Belgium-based crypto market maker Keyrock, told Forkast on Tuesday morning in Asia. “The fact that the news doesn’t come as a shock doesn’t mean that it was priced in, apparently.”\n\nIn a Monday tweet, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said that Zhao and Binance entities engaged in “an extensive web of deception, conflicts of interest, lack of disclosure and calculated evasion of the law.”\n\nStory continues\n\nIn response, Zhao tweeted: “Wonder if he ever reads the comments under his post, from the consumers he is [supposed] to protect.”\n\nWonder if he ever reads the comments under his post, from the consumers he is suppose to protect. https://t.co/xQjC872GsD — CZ 🔶 Binance (@cz_binance) June 5, 2023\n\nAccording to d’Anethan, the SEC’s legal action is not a surprise considering the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission had earlier filed a lawsuit against Binance for alleged violations of trading rules for derivatives.\n\nHowever, traders see the lawsuit as extremely bearish and it’s shaking up the market, he said.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap fell 4.6% to US$1.09 trillion in the 24 hours through to 8:30am Hong Kong, while trading volume surged 118% to more than US$48 billion.\n\nApple headset bumps Binance in NFT market\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index edged down 0.17% to 3,295.91 in the 24 hours to 9:20 a.m. in Hong Kong.\n\nThe SEC’s lawsuit against Binance “hasn’t had an impact on NFTs yet, but it likely will,” Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News, said on Tuesday. “It has already impacted crypto, and usually NFTs lag behind just a bit.”\n\nIn the U.S. overnight, Apple Inc. unveiled its highly-anticipated mixed-reality headset Vision Pro. While priced at a hefty US$3,499, the headset has got the NFT industry excited about its potential application in metaverse developments.\n\n“Apple’s headset is really all the NFT spaces was talking about today and rightfully so,” Petscher said. “Really, it’s the single most important thing to happen to NFTs since CryptoPunks, even though Apple didn’t mention NFTs or the metaverse once in their reveal of the Vision Pro.”\n\nSébastien Borget, co-founder and chief operating officer of decentralized gaming giant The Sandbox, said in a Tuesday interview with Forkast that Apple’s headset is “opening a big field of opportunity” for metaverse developments.\n\n“This has the highest chance of becoming a game changer versus everything we’ve seen so far over the past five years in this field … allowing people to interact with their virtual assets in the physical world.”\n\nNFT sales on Ethereum rose 5.64% over the last 24 hours to US$25.75 million, and gained 90.84% in the past week. Sales on the Bitcoin network climbed 4.17% to US$3.16 million, but recorded a 11.87% weekly decline.\n\nBored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and Azuki remained the two most-sold Ethereum collections.

A Closer Look At The Bitcoin Supply - Nasdaq', 'content': "The article below is an excerpt from a recent edition of Bitcoin Magazine PRO, Bitcoin Magazine's premium markets newsletter. To be among the first to receive these insights and other on-chain bitcoin market analysis straight to your inbox, subscribe now.\n\nWho Holds The Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin’s public ledger comes with a unique level of transparency that includes significant information detailing where the bitcoin supply lives. With the help of address tracking, public announcements and some estimation across data sources, we can get a sense of where nearly 47% of total bitcoin supply is today. A considerable portion of bitcoin’s 21-million supply is estimated to be lost, which includes Satoshi Nakamoto’s coins. There’s useful data from both Glassnode and Chainalysis to suggest that nearly 4 million bitcoin has been lost.\n\nOther large amounts of bitcoin are on exchanges, in the Grayscale trust, or in bitcoin miners’ wallets. Swaths of bitcoin have been accumulated by the likes of MicroStrategy, and more recently Tether. Some 5,500 bitcoin are locked up on the Lightning Network, while other sums exist as wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) on blockchains besides Bitcoin.\n\nMost bitcoin estimates can be tracked on a routine basis when looking at examples, like known U.S. government-associated on-chain addresses from various bitcoin seizures, or when analyzing monthly production updates from public bitcoin miners, while other holding details can be much harder to come by. A private institution may have indicated bitcoin holdings years ago, but isn’t required to publicly announce updates of their stash. Other instances include uncertainty around government holdings. China may have 194,000 bitcoin from seizure, but it’s difficult to verify if this number is current.\n\nAll that said, the below chart is a rough cut of available data that can be expanded upon and improved for better accuracy across different groups. These figures come from on-chain forensics, public SEC filings and balance sheet attestations.\n\nBitcoin holdings separated by type of entity.\n\nOf the 2.3 million of bitcoin on exchanges, the majority resides on Binance and Coinbase. This wouldn’t include bitcoin in investment custody products like Grayscale and Coinbase Custody, for example. Binance’s share of bitcoin on exchanges has risen from under 10% in 2019 up to 30% today. The company is estimated to have nearly 700,000 bitcoin on their platform, which can predominantly be attributed to their derivatives marketplace dominance and their international presence, whereas Coinbase is mainly a spot exchange with a heavy U.S. presence.\n\nThe percent share of exchanges' bitcoin balances.\n\nOver time, the amount of circulating bitcoin supply on exchanges has reached 17.5% of circulating supply, reaching its peak in March 2020 before declining to just 11.89%. We suspect that the trend of declining bitcoin on exchanges as a percentage of circulating supply will continue as bitcoin distributes across an increased number of global adopters, thanks to sophisticated personal custody solutions becoming more mainstream and robust as time goes on.\n\nA little less than 12% of circulating bitcoin is held on exchanges.\n\nIn absolute terms, there has never been this level of long-term holders in bitcoin. In relative terms, the only two times in history with a larger share of long-term holder coins is in 2009 before bitcoin had an exchange rate, and in the depths of the 2015 bear market. With so much of the supply off the market, sell-side pressure in the interim can result in large price adjustments to the downside, since many market participants are partaking in more of a passive role.\n\nLong-term holders' percentage of circulating supply is growing.\n\nWe can also look at bitcoin’s illiquid supply to quantify holder dynamics. The term “illiquid supply” refers to bitcoin that are held by entities that rarely sell, meaning these coins are not readily available for trading. To quantify this, an entity's bitcoin holdings are deemed illiquid if less than 25% of its received bitcoins have been spent, liquid if 25% to 75% have been spent, and highly liquid if over 75% have been spent.\n\nIn the post-2016 halving era, bitcoin’s illiquid supply as a percentage of circulating supply is at its highest level, with holder accumulation taking coins off the market faster than miner issuance can distribute them.\n\nAs of this April 2023, bitcoin’s illiquid supply surpassed 15,000,000 coins.\n\nA large majority of bitcoin's supply is illiquid.\n\nIlliquid bitcoin supply has trended upward since 2016.\n\nThe trend is clear: Bitcoin continues to distribute into more hands, with a greater concentration of supply shifting from entities holding large amounts of bitcoin — balances of 1,000-10,000 BTC, 10,000-100,000 BTC, and greater than 100,000 BTC — to entities holding balances of 10 BTC or less.\n\nEntities' bitcoin balances of over 1,000 bitcoin has been trending down since 2011.\n\nBitcoin balances of less than 10 bitcoin h..."}]

The cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, experienced significant declines following news of regulatory actions against major players such as Binance. The SEC's lawsuits against Binance and its founder, as well as the proposed 30% tax on Bitcoin mining energy use, have created uncertainty and led to increased market volatility. These events have contributed to the downward trend in cryptocurrency prices, with Bitcoin falling below $26,000 and Ethereum below $1,900. The market sentiment appears bearish as traders react to the regulatory crackdown, indicating a potential continuation of the downward trend in the short term.

The information provided on this page is for educational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice. Money does not offer advisory services.***\n\nThe crypto market has been laying somewhat low in 2023 compared to its massive price swings that made constant headlines in recent years.\n\nBut we’re now less than a year out from an event that has historically seen bitcoin’s price rise during the lead-up and aftermath: bitcoin halving, which happens once every four years.\n\nThe regular event limits the amount of new bitcoins that come to the market. Because of the historical gains around bitcoin halving, some investors are hoping that the next halving, expected in April or May of 2024, could spur the start of a crypto bull run (a period of prices going up). That would be welcome news for investors, given thatbitcoin prices— along with those of other financial assets, like stock prices — have taken a hit in the last year amid interest rates hikes and recession fears.\n\nBut can we actually expect a price boost as we head towards the next halving? Here’s what crypto investors should know.\n\nWhat is bitcoin halving?\n\nBitcoin halving has everything to do with bitcoin miners, who are involved in the process of creating new bitcoins. That includes everyone from individual hobbyists to corporate enterprises, with anywhere from one to thousands of specialized computers. These computers work constantly at the singular task of solving mathematical problems for the bitcoin network. If a computer solves a problem, it is rewarded with the bitcoin that is minted as a result of its work.\n\nBitcoin halving causes the total reward that miners receive for their work to be slashed in half. Miners currently earn 6.25 bitcoin for solving a problem, but they will begin to receive only 3.125 bitcoin for their efforts after the halving. From its very inception, bitcoin’s creator only ever intended for the supply to reach 21 million coins — and the goal of the bitcoin halving is to decrease the supply of new bitcoin overtime.\n\nMuch of the rhetoric around halving as a cause for a crypto rally has to do with this tightening of rewards. Many investors see the event as increasing scarcity of bitcoin and say it will inflate the coin’s value because of supply and demand economics.\n\nBitcoin halving has historically come with price gains\n\nSo far, there has been a bitcoin halving in 2012, 2016 and 2020 — and each one has seen the price of bitcoin rise in the months before and after the event.\n\nFollowing the 2016 halving, for instance, bitcoin’s price jumped to a record of nearly $20,000 per coin in 2017. In the year leading up to the May 2020 halving, bitcoin’s price rose around 20%. Between the halving and the end of the year, bitcoin’s price gained more than 200%.\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of how bitcoin’s price will do in the future, but there’s already chatter about the halving’s potential as fuel for a new price run.\n\nWill there be a crypto bull run?\n\nSome crypto experts are challenging the notion that the bitcoin halving is going to bring on a prolonged bull market. Crypto is still relatively new, so nothing should be taken as a certainty, says Omid Malekan, an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School. He adds that when it comes to the bitcoin network, nothing changes for anybody during a halving except for miners: There’s a misconception that the halving reduces the overall supply of bitcoin, but it really just reduces the amount of new bitcoin coming on the market, Malekan says. The plan is that there will still ultimately be 21 million coins, as was always intended. Plus, the halving is no surprise.\n\n“You would think [halving events] would be priced in long before the actual event and not have any material impact,” Malekan says.\n\nThere’s a lot of back and forth about whether or not the halving is baked into bitcoin’s price, and whether the fact that bitcoins are scarce make them more valuable. Morningstar senior research analyst Madeline Hume’s recent analysis of bitcoin scarcity indicates that the argument that increasing the scarcity of new bitcoin pushes up its value is reductive. Hume notes that bitcoin looks on charts like its pricing operates in four-year cycles, which seems to indicate a correlation between scarcity and price increases. But she also notes that, excluding the “honeymoon periods” that followed previous halvings, the relationship between the production of new bitcoin and prices is more or less negligible.\n\n“[It could] be pure coincidence that bitcoin’s halving cycles arrived just as narratives around crypto reached their frothy peaks, and the relationship is totally spurious,” Hume says. She goes on to also say that a major flaw in these scarcity-based analyses is that they all predict bitcoin’s price will keep going up, which is impossible to know.\n\nCould the bitcoin halving cause prices to drop?\n\nIt’s possible that the bitco...'}]

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
The recent lawsuits filed by the SEC against Coinbase and Binance have caused volatility in the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin initially dropping but then rallying above $27,000. Ethereum also saw gains after the SEC sued Coinbase. The market reacted negatively to the news, with Bitcoin slipping below $25,800 after the SEC sued Binance, leading to a bloodbath across digital assets. The upcoming Bitcoin halving event in 2024 is anticipated to potentially spur a crypto bull run, as historical data shows price gains following previous halving events. However, there is debate among experts about whether the halving will have a significant impact on prices, with some suggesting that the event may already be priced in. Overall, the market is likely to remain volatile in the coming weeks as regulatory issues and anticipation of the halving event continue to influence investor sentiment.

The recent SEC lawsuits against major cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase and Binance have caused turbulence in the market, leading to short-term fluctuations in Bitcoin's price. However, the belief that Bitcoin is not considered a security by the SEC has encouraged investors to view it as a safe bet within the market, resulting in a 5% increase in its value. Additionally, the crackdown on crypto marketing and the increasing regulatory scrutiny in countries like the UK may impact the overall cryptocurrency market in the near future. As a cryptocurrency trading analyst, it is important to closely monitor regulatory developments and market sentiment to anticipate potential market trends and adjust trading strategies accordingly.

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the market trend for ETH is currently bearish, with a potential for further price declines in the near future. The data indicates a consistent decrease in the open price of ETH, along with increasing average fees and volatility in total size used and total value transferred. The macd_signal consistently indicates a sell trend, reinforcing the bearish sentiment.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights a mixed sentiment in the overall cryptocurrency market, with potential impacts from upcoming events such as the Federal Reserve meeting and regulatory developments. This mixed sentiment adds to the cautious market outlook, indicating a potential for increased volatility.

In reflection of the reports, it is clear that a focus on long-term strategies based on on-chain analysis and key news developments has been more successful in navigating the volatile ETH market. Short-term trends and mixed market sentiment have led to some losses, emphasizing the importance of a cautious and moderately conservative trading approach.

Considering the synthesized reports, the clear market trend for ETH appears to be bearish in the short term, with potential volatility based on external factors. Therefore, it is advisable to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains to optimize gains and manage risks effectively.

Based on this analysis, my trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.7, reflecting a moderately conservative approach to navigate the current market conditions and optimize long-term gains.

This Skyrocketing Stock Is a Screaming Buy - The Motley Fool', 'content': "Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) mining stocks have seen a huge rally this year, largely on the strength of Bitcoin's market-topping performance in the crypto market. Bitcoin is now up 60% year to date, and Bitcoin mining stocks are up even more. Riot Platforms (RIOT 0.95%), for example, is up about 215% for the year.\n\nThe big question for investors, of course, is whether this rally has legs. Even after Riot Platforms reported better-than-expected numbers in May, its stock price still fell by 13%. Much of that has to do with Bitcoin's recent inability to break through the $30,000 price level, which has investors concerned that the crypto's sizzling performance to start the year may be coming to an end.\n\nRiot and the price of Bitcoin\n\nLong story short, Bitcoin mining stocks tend to move up and down with Bitcoin. This makes perfect sense because the core business activity of any Bitcoin miner is, well, mining Bitcoin. The more Bitcoin a company mines, the more money it makes. And the higher the price of Bitcoin goes, the more valuable each Bitcoin it mines becomes. It's not rocket science.\n\nIf you're a long-term buy-and-hold investor, though, this well-known correlation makes investing in Bitcoin mining stocks very problematic. It means that you will be tempted to sell during low points of the Bitcoin market and buy during high points of the Bitcoin market. This is exactly the opposite of a buy-low, sell-high strategy, and highlights the perils of trying to time markets.\n\nImpact of the Bitcoin halving\n\nInvestors are keeping a close eye on the next Bitcoin halving, now scheduled for April 2024. Halvings take place only once every four years and are one of the most anticipated events in the Bitcoin community, primarily due to a past history of significant price gains that have accompanied every halving event since 2012.\n\nIn a halving, the reward for mining a new block of Bitcoin falls by half. Thus, in April 2024, the reward for mining new coins will drop from 6.25 Bitcoins to 3.125 Bitcoins. On the surface, this would seem to be a negative development for Bitcoin miners. It means they will be expending the same amount of energy but getting a smaller reward, right?\n\nHowever, if you take into account the price appreciation in Bitcoin that can occur both before and after a halving, then this effect is largely negated. There have now been three past Bitcoin halvings (in 2012, 2016, and 2020), and each one has seen monster price appreciation for Bitcoin. In 2020, for example, the price of Bitcoin exploded by 688% after the halving.\n\nAlthough there is some debate about whether this historical cycle will repeat in 2024, there are plenty of analysts and investors who think it will, so it could become a self-fulfilling prophecy. By some estimates, the price of Bitcoin could blow through its all-time high of $68,790 and move toward $100,000 -- if not higher. And that would be tremendous news for Riot. Even though the company will be earning less Bitcoin next year, each new Bitcoin might become much more valuable.\n\nIs Riot a good long-term investment?\n\nIn the short run, then, Riot would seem to be an attractive investment target. But what about in the long run? From my perspective, there are two variables to consider here.\n\nThe first variable is whether Riot Platforms can remain a best-in-class Bitcoin miner. Based on what we know about Riot's current mining capacity and willingness to take on new Bitcoin mining infrastructure, this looks very favorable. Dating back to the start of 2022, Riot has mined the second-highest number of Bitcoins in the industry. And it has done so with a lower cost basis than its rivals.\n\nThe other variable is whether Riot can diversify its core business so that it is not so cyclical. Riot is never going to be a stock you can buy and forget about until it is more diversified. There's good news on this front. In January, the company changed its name from Riot Blockchain to Riot Platforms as a way to signal to the market that the company has future plans to diversify. Some have suggested that Riot could find other uses for its high-performance computer facilities, including artificial intelligence and cybersecurity.\n\nUntil this happens, the decision of whether to invest in Riot is still just a decision of where you think the market for Bitcoin is headed. Personally, I think the market for Bitcoin is headed higher in 2023 and early 2024, primarily due to the upcoming halving event. From my perspective, that makes Riot a screaming buy for the next 12 months."}, {'id': 7, 'time': 'Thu, 08 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Bitcoin, Ether rise amid 'swoon-soar' trading after SEC lawsuits against Binance, Coinbase - Yahoo Finance", 'content': 'Bitcoin prices rose in Friday morning trading in Asia, but failed to break back above US$27,000 after a rollercoaster week in crypto markets following the lawsuits by U.S. securities regulators against the Binance and Coinbase exchanges.

This number in USD equivalent fluctuates a little as crypto prices change. And declining as users withdraw due to recent news,” Zhao tweeted. “All user funds are accounted for, and never left the Binance.US platform (unless users withdraw themselves of course), ever.”\n\nGordon Grant, co-head of trading at crypto brokerage Genesis Trading, said that this week’s sweeping regulatory pronouncements “saw crypto realized volatility begin to rear its head.”\n\n“After seeming months of coiling in an ornery, reptilian rip-rap price action, the successive Monday and Tuesday swoon-soar tandem on the back of Binance and Coinbase headlines preempted consternation, head scratching and, if nothing else, a recognition that the asset class remains habitually prone to lurid gaps in price action,” Grant said.\n\nIn an email, Le Shi, head of trading at Auros, a crypto market-making and algorithmic trading firm, said cryptocurrency trading volumes continue to “plumb the depths” last seen in the middle of the last crypto bear market.\n\nCoinShares, a European crypto investment firm, said in a Thursday report shared with Forkast that while the SEC lawsuits seem to carry more severe implications for Binance, the potential impact on Coinbase and the broader crypto industry is significant.\n\n“The charges insinuate that a majority of crypto assets should be categorized as securities, which would radically modify the regulatory landscape, potentially confining access to regulated Wall Street entities (assuming that they have the appetite once the litigation is over),” CoinShares wrote.\n\nCoinShares added that the shift could potentially place the control of the crypto industry within the grasp of traditional financial institutions.\n\nNFT sales drop\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index dipped 1.07% to 3,219.65 in the 24 hours to 9:45 a.m. in Hong Kong. The index was down 4.59% for the week.\n\nNFT sales on Ethereum fell 14.4% over the last 24 hours to US$13.72 million, and sales on the Bitcoin network dropped 9.34% to US$3.53 million, according to CryptoSlam data.\n\n“[It’s a] hard market to analyze right now,” Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News, said on Friday.\n\n“On one hand I believe we’ll see capitulation to the negative news, especially once the SEC files lawsuits against (NFT) projects, but at the same time, we are seeing bullish news from projects, art, among others, on an almost daily basis,” Petscher added. “I don’t think the SEC’s lawsuits have played a factor yet.

Short-term fluctuations and regulatory challenges pose risks that can lead to losses if not managed carefully.

Considering the synthesized reports, the clear market trend for ETH appears to be bearish in the short term. Therefore, it is advisable to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains to optimize profitability and manage risks effectively.

Based on this analysis, I would take a slightly bearish stance on ETH and assign a trading action of -0.3 to reflect my confidence in the downward trend and my strategic decision to approach trading cautiously in the current market conditions.
ACTION:
-0.3
DAILY RETURN:
0.0038786873200926664
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the market trend for ETH is bearish, with indicators pointing towards a potential further decline. The fluctuating average fee for transactions, varying total size used, and inconsistent total value transferred all suggest a lack of stability in the market. Additionally, the MACD signal consistently indicating a sell trend reinforces the bearish sentiment.

The news analyst report highlights the volatility in the cryptocurrency market due to regulatory issues, such as the lawsuits filed by the SEC against major exchanges like Coinbase and Binance. While there is anticipation surrounding the Bitcoin halving event in 2024, the debate among experts about its impact on prices adds to the uncertainty in the market.

In light of these reports, it is evident that a focus on long-term strategies is crucial in navigating the volatile ETH market. Short-term trends and market sentiment have led to losses, emphasizing the importance of a cautious and moderately conservative trading approach. The current market conditions, characterized by bearish sentiment, regulatory challenges, and increasing volatility, warrant a strategic decision to prioritize long-term gains over short-term profits.

Considering the synthesized reports and the emphasis on long-term strategies, I would take a slightly bearish stance on ETH trading with a confidence level of -0.3. This reflects my cautious approach in managing risks and optimizing profitability in the long run.

There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin and there is a gradual taper from the early days of extremely easy mining to a tiny crawl by the very end of bitcoin mining’s lifespan. The mechanism for this gradual taper takes the form of the “halving” event, when certain passed milestones in bitcoin mined will automatically cut all mining rewards in half. In other words, the same amount of equipment and electricity will create half as many assets as it had a day before. The next halving is about a year away.\n\nThis event has happened three times in Bitcoin’s past, and according to research published in June by JPMorgan, the last two halvings led to a rally in bitcoin’s price. The 2024 halving seems well on track to continue this trend, as the report claims that a halving “would mechanically double bitcoin production cost to around $40,000, creating a positive psychological effect.”\n\nSpecifically, the increase in production cost would help raise the floor for bitcoin’s valuation, and lead to an increase in demand for coins in circulation. Institutional investment has diminished somewhat, the report claims, but Ordinals and the BRC-20 protocol have been attracting lots of attention from retail investors. This endorsement of future performance is particularly interesting from JPMorgan, as the firm has historically displayed a skeptical attitude for Bitcoin.\n\nOne of the main effects the halving will have on the Bitcoin community is its radical impact on miners. With such a sheer drop in productivity, mining firms will surely struggle to maintain market viability for the sheer output of equipment and electricity. Instead, only the firms that are the most well configured to run efficiently will be able to weather the storm. When less efficient miners are pushed out of the pool, this will leave these miners able to take home a bigger proportion of the pie. In the end, the halving will be a mechanism that forces the whole industry’s hardware to optimize.\n\nIndeed, to an untrained observer, it might be quite surprising that the community is full of predictions that the halving will only spell good things for Bitcoin. How could increased costs of production be good for business? The simple answer is that, because Bitcoin has already been halved many times before and “trimming the fat” of mining operations has historically led to more buzz from investment, Bitcoiners are assuming the same will take place again. The difficulty in acquiring fresh bitcoin will lead to increased interest in purchasing old ones, and the mining industry will be disrupted in a way that ultimately benefits it.\n\nThe halving is expected to take place in about a year, according to current industry estimates, and there is still plenty of time to observe the trends in the market and adjust these predictions accordingly. With years of experience behind it, however, the Bitcoin community is resolute.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.'}]

That crushes the gains of both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite Index by insanely wide margins. And it has no doubt made some early adopters extremely wealthy.\n\nEven though Bitcoin has been around for about 14 years, I don\'t think it\'s too late to get in on the action. Right now, the price is 61% off its all-time high from November 2021, so there is some heightened pessimism around this top cryptocurrency. But can buying now help you become a millionaire?\n\nGiven enough time, I believe the answer is a resounding "yes."\n\nThere is a clear need for Bitcoin\n\nIt\'s important to first take a step back and understand why Bitcoin is even needed in the world. Think about citizens dealing with corrupt governments (like Mexico\'s), or currencies that experience hyperinflation (like in Venezuela), or countries ravaged by war (like Afghanistan). The people in these places can\'t rely on the current financial systems that are in place. A decentralized form of money that can\'t be confiscated, that isn\'t controlled by anyone, and that can be stored on the internet or devices that connect to the web is extremely valuable in these types of situations.\n\nIn the U.S., skeptics would make the argument that there is no need for Bitcoin because we have a robust payments industry and developed capital markets. This misses the point that Bitcoin is a global network. Moreover, we take our working financial infrastructure for granted, while people in other countries struggle with a lack of basic banking services or stable currency.\n\nPlus, Bitcoin does serve a need in the U.S. Some investors and institutions are keen on holding a portion of their wealth in the world\'s most valuable cryptocurrency. That\'s because Bitcoin has a fixed supply cap of 21 million, yet over the past decade, central banks around the world have pumped so much money into the economy to stimulate growth after the Great Recession and throughout the coronavirus pandemic. The more fiat money, or government-backed currency, that there is relative to Bitcoin, the better the prospects for the latter\'s price appreciation.\n\nThe staggering debt burden of the U.S., which will only be exacerbated by further increases of the national debt ceiling in the future, also tells me that we can\'t keep interest rates high for too long. This increases the odds of elevated levels of inflation for extended periods of time. Holding Bitcoin makes even more sense with this in mind.\n\nRunning the numbers\n\nBitcoin has a market cap of about $516 billion. But let\'s say that a decade from now, its entire value equals that of the total value of all the world\'s gold, or roughly $12.5 trillion. I don\'t think this scenario is out of the question. As more individuals, corporations, and governments learn about Bitcoin and its attractive properties, it\'s probable that they would at least store a small fraction of their investable assets or reserves in it.\n\nThis would mean that Bitcoin\'s price would rise about 25-fold between now and the summer of 2033. This performance would likely crush what investors could earn putting their money in the stock market (or any asset class, for that matter). This projection suggests that a $40,000 investment in Bitcoin today could make someone a millionaire in 10 years\' time.\n\nTo be clear, there are a ton of risks to think about. The most pressing one is the threat of governments banning Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, making it illegal to buy and own these digital assets. That\'s something to always keep in mind. Additionally, Bitcoin simply might not be adopted as widely as many hope.\n\nBitcoin could reach that projected value in a much longer time frame, or maybe not at all. The range of outcomes is vast.\n\nNonetheless, the potential is certainly there for Bitcoin to make you a millionaire.'}, {'id': 2, 'time': 'Sat, 10 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ohio needs to champion bitcoin and blockchain technologies| columnist - The Columbus Dispatch', 'content': 'Andrew Burchwell\n\nGuest Columnist\n\nOhio’s historical legacy is rooted in innovation. Our economic success and progress have always depended on our willingness to try new things – leading to innovations in energy manufacturing, healthcare, IT and more. Today, as we see new opportunities through digital advancements in blockchain technologies like bitcoin, it’s critical we keep our innovative spirit alive and open to stay competitive in an increasingly complex and global environment.\n\nOhioans might be surprised to learn that our state is home to many industry leaders in bitcoin and blockchain development. One reason for the unfamiliarity is that industry leaders benefit from a unified voice to advocate for the industry’s potential, and Ohio is just beginning to organize and champion bitcoin and blockchain technologies from a statewide perspective.\u200b\n\nIf we do not act with an intention, Ohio will miss out on a generational opportunity for its communities, businesses, and families. We are still very early in the development of these technologies, and it is an opportunity Ohio is uniquely positioned to capture.\n\nAt Ohio Blockchain Council, we are working to unite industries under a common banner to advance bitcoin and blockchain technologies for and within our great state. We believe Ohio is well positioned to be a global leader in innovation and development. Combining the resources of multiple companies from various business sectors is our most effective pathway to progress.\n\nOne of the barriers to adoption of any technology is public understanding. The technology behind Bitcoin and blockchain is unquestionably complicated. What is not complicated, though still underemphasized in our public conversation, is the direct positive impact these technologies could have on all of Ohio’s communities. Families across Ohio struggle with high healthcare costs. Recently the Cleveland Clinic, IBM, Aetna and Anthem announced a partnership that will utilize blockchain to improve efficiency, reduce costs and enhance customer experience.\n\nOhio’s rural population stands to uniquely benefit from bitcoin adoption. While bitcoin mining operations like the Standard Power facility in Coshocton create jobs and increase local economic activity, the long-term implications of bitcoin adoption are far greater. It looks like farmers utilizing bitcoin to exert greater control over their pricing, markets and quality assurance. It means small businesses using bitcoin to avoid fees and open themselves up to new customer bases. It allows a new source of funding for municipalities struggling to compete and provide new accommodations for residents. These are just a few examples of the many ways in which the lives of Ohioans will be transformed for the better through innovation.\n\nBitcoin and blockchain technology also carry the potential to help solve one of our most complicated and pervasive challenges today: public trust. According to a recent Pew Research report, only two out of 10 Americans trust the federal government. University of Chicago Institute of Politics research indicates that a majority of Americans agree with the statement “the government is corrupt and rigged against everyday people like me.” Here in Ohio, where we’re living through a still unfolding massive public corruption scandal, it’s very likely trust in public institutions is at an all-time low.\n\nBlockchain technology can help rebuild public trust by enhancing accountability in government contracting, electronic voting, grant disbursement and more, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office. That’s because blockchain technology is by definition decentralized, objective and transparent.\n\nMore:Logistics, bitcoin companies receive state tax incentives to create 125 jobs in Columbus\n\nOhio’s congressional delegation has been championing these issues because they know how important they are to our state’s growth. It’s not a red vs. blue issue, and has been overwhelmingly bipartisan through the leadership of Rep. Warren Davidson (R) and Rep. Joyce Beatty (D) in the House of Representatives and newly elected Sen. J.D. Vance (R) in the Senate.\n\nHowever, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D) has been absent as a champion and leader on bitcoin and the underlying blockchain technology. He sits as chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, which has jurisdiction on these important issues, but has yet to be a forward-leaning advocate for our state. Senator Brown has the opportunity to propel Ohio into a category of its own on bitcoin, and we are here to show him that the work being done across our beautiful state is only just beginning.\n\nBitcoin and blockchain technologies represent significant potential for uplifting communities, businesses, and families. Harnessing this potential is only possible through an aligned, unified and collaborative approach toward adoption and public policy. This is our mission at Ohio Blockchain Council, and we believe Ohio can truly be...'}, {'id': 10, 'time': 'Sat, 10 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Bitcoin's 'digital gold' narrative sees renaissance — even as pro traders balk - DLNews", 'content': "JPMorgan analysts say Bitcoin could track gold higher, reaching up to $45,000.\n\nPro traders, as well as commodities analysts, say Bitcoin is too speculative to be considered gold-like.\n\nThe narratives underlie the surging cryptocurrency, which has gained about 50% this year.\n\nBitcoin’s digital gold comparisons are mounting with the top cryptocurrency trading back around levels last seen in July of last year.\n\nJPMorgan analysts say Bitcoin could track gold higher over the next year.

This is a major difference. The metric tracks Bitcoin’s share relative to that of the rest of the market and is a clear indication of the dynamic between both.\n\nWhen the BTC dominance rises, it means BTC’s price is performing better than the altcoin market.\n\nNow, the major cryptocurrency is down 3.1% on the day, which is definitely not good news, but the rest of the market is performing a lot worse. This is why the dominance is increasing.\n\nAlicia Bakery CMO - A really good agency Did you like this market update?\n\nThis is all you need not to miss any price action in the raging crypto markets.

Another major trading platform – Robinhood, also announced plans to start delisting some altcoins in consideration of the above.\n\nHowever, it’s worth noting that those cryptocurrencies that haven’t been named in the SEC’s claim are performing a bit better. For instance, Ethereum’s ETH is down only about 5%, while Ripple’s XRP is down around 6%. This is still a lot, but it’s nowhere near the 20% (and more) that coins like ADA< SOL, and MATIC, among others, lost today.'}, {'id': 7, 'time': 'Sun, 11 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Bhutan puts Bitcoin mining plan in motion to power up economy - Nikkei Asia', 'content': 'THIMPHU -- The tiny Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan, known for its Gross National Happiness development indicator, is embarking on a cryptocurrency mining project as it aspires to build a 21st-century economy.\n\nThe country has teamed up with Nasdaq-listed Bitdeer Technologies Group, based in Singapore, to develop a 600 megawatt mining farm for Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency. Bitdeer was due to establish a closed-end fund at the end of May, aimed at raising $500 million from international investors for the project. A high-level source close to the project confirmed that the fundraising drive indeed began as planned.\n\n"While Bhutan faces geographical constraints and connectivity challenges, being landlocked and mountainous, its green and relatively cheaper power provides an opportunity to invest in digital assets to build a more connected and sustainable economy," said Ujjwal Deep Dahal, CEO of Druk Holding and Investments (DHI), the government investment arm that is partnering with Bitdeer.\n\n"In doing so, it will deepen local knowledge and engagement in the rapidly evolving technology landscape and equip citizens to participate in the modern global economy from within Bhutan."\n\nThe move into crypto mining, a notoriously volatile and controversial industry, comes as the country is still recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, which shrank the economy by 10% in 2020. Foreign currency reserves have declined, nonperforming loans in the manufacturing and tourism sectors have increased and youth unemployment reached 29% last year.\n\nThis has cast a shadow over Bhutan\'s "development success story," in the words of the World Bank, with an estimated 12.4% of the population of around 786,000 living below the national poverty line last year, up from 8.2% in 2017, according to government surveys.\n\nGrowth is forecast at 4.6% this year. But tourism, the country\'s second-largest revenue earner, is not expected to reach pre-pandemic levels until 2025 because of new regulations and a slow recovery in global travel.\n\nThe government hopes to diversify, on the way to building a high-income economy in the next decade. It is looking at opportunities not only in blockchain-based currencies but also fields such as artificial intelligence, robotics and biotechnology. The education system is also being reformed to emphasize critical thinking, creativity and digital literacy, with coding lessons for students aged 8 and up.\n\nFor crypto miners, Bhutan\'s green and relatively low-cost energy supply, mainly from hydropower, makes it an attractive destination.\n\n"We are excited to be working alongside DHI in accessing Bhutan\'s zero-emissions power to sustainably enable the blockchain technologies that will eventually form an immutable bedrock for a global store of value," said Jihan Wu, chairman of Bitdeer Technologies Group, in a media release earlier in May.\n\nMining operations accounting for the first 100 MW are expected to begin this September, before reaching 600 MW in the next three years. Power will be sold to the operator at a negotiated rate.\n\nAt 100 MW, the project would be country\'s single largest energy consumer, while at 600 MW it would use more energy than the rest of the nation combined. Bhutan\'s peak demand was recorded at around 488 MW in December 2021, according to records with the Bhutan Power Corporation.\n\nFarm produce for sale along the Thimphu-Paro highway: More than 50% of the Bhutanese population is engaged in agriculture. (Photo by Phuntsho Wangdi)\n\nBhutan has an installed capacity of about 2,400 MW and sells most of its river hydro generation to India in the summer. In winter, it imports electricity when generation dwindles to about 414 MW. But the consistent supply is set to increase once a new 118 MW power plant comes online later this year, and a 1,020 MW facility opens in October 2024.\n\nFor now, the seasonal variation in power generation has been considered in the Bitdeer agreement, with domestic requirements to receive first priority and operations to shut in winter when generation dips.\n\nAlthough Bhutan\'s equity in the project will be small, the arrangement promises to create a source of dollars from the sale of power, taxes and profit-sharing. The plan is to use the funds to further strengthen the electric grid and telecom network.\n\nThe project is also expected to create between 300 to 400 jobs for Bhutanese and open up a "whole new vertical within which we can set up resource centers to look more closely at blockchain and asset design, and communicate with our university to build R&D projects," said DHI\'s Dahal.\n\nThe excitement, however, comes with some trepidation over using national resources to enter an unpredictable industry that few truly understand. Other countries that have jumped into crypto mining have run into problems. In the Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan, a sudden boom in crypto mining strained the power grid, leading to localized blackouts and contributing to the protests that rocked the co...'}]

The news articles suggest a mixed outlook for the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin's dominance increasing as altcoins experience significant losses due to regulatory concerns from the SEC. Despite Bitcoin's price decline, its dominance indicates relative strength compared to altcoins. Additionally, Bhutan's entry into Bitcoin mining could potentially impact the market by increasing supply and demand dynamics. Overall, the market trend may lean towards Bitcoin's resilience and dominance, while altcoins face challenges amidst regulatory uncertainties.

"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing fluctuations in price and transaction volume, with no clear direction indicated. The news analyst report highlights the volatility caused by recent SEC lawsuits but also points towards potential growth leading up to the Bitcoin halving event in April 2024. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the effectiveness of long-term strategies and a cautious approach in navigating the volatile market.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is evident that the market trend is uncertain in the short term but cautiously optimistic in the long term, especially with the upcoming Bitcoin halving event. Therefore, prioritizing long-term strategies over short-term gains is recommended to manage risks effectively and optimize profitability.

Given the current market conditions and the emphasis on long-term strategies, I would take a slightly bullish approach with a trading action of 0.3. This reflects a moderate level of confidence in the potential for growth leading up to the Bitcoin halving event while also acknowledging the need to remain cautious and adaptable to market volatility.
ACTION:

DAILY RETURN:

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain, news, and reflection analyst reports, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing uncertainty with fluctuating trends. The on-chain data shows mixed signals from indicators and fluctuations in various metrics, indicating a lack of clear direction. On the other hand, the news analyst report suggests a positive outlook for Bitcoin, with potential bullish movements due to factors like in-house custody transitions and the upcoming halving event.

In reflecting on recent trading performance, it is evident that a cautious and long-term strategy has been more effective in navigating the volatile market. Prioritizing long-term gains over short-term profits has proven to be beneficial in managing risks and optimizing profitability. Given the uncertainty in the short term and potential growth opportunities in the long term, a slightly conservative approach is warranted.

Considering the synthesized reports, the market trend for ETH appears to be uncertain in the short term, with potential for both bullish and bearish movements. However, a long-term bullish outlook can be inferred from the positive news surrounding Bitcoin and the benefits of a cautious, long-term trading strategy.

Therefore, I would take a slightly conservative approach and assign a trading action of 0.3, reflecting moderate confidence in the long-term bullish trend while also acknowledging the short-term uncertainty in the market. This decision aims to manage risk appropriately and prioritize long-term gains over short-term fluctuations.

On June 6, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Coinbase, the second-largest crypto exchange by volume, according to CoinMarketCap.com. The federal regulator alleges Coinbase operated its crypto asset trading platform as an unregistered national securities exchange and broker, per the June 6 press release. The SEC also alleges at least 13 crypto assets that Coinbase made available to customers, including Solana and Cardano\'s tokens, qualify as "crypto asset securities," according to the complaint. Coinbase\'s staking program, which the regulator describes as a way for crypto investors "to earn financial returns through Coinbase\'s managerial efforts," counts as an investment contract and unregistered security, the SEC says. In a tweet following the SEC\'s announcement, Coinbase co-founder and CEO Brian Armstrong said, in part, "Regarding the SEC complaint against us today, we\'re proud to represent the industry in court to finally get some clarity around crypto rules." "The SEC\'s reliance on an enforcement-only approach in the absence of clear rules for the digital asset industry is hurting America\'s economic competitiveness and companies like Coinbase that have a demonstrated commitment to compliance," Coinbase\'s chief legal officer and general counsel Paul Grewal said in a statement to CNBC Make It. "In the meantime, we\'ll continue to operate our business as usual." This comes just one day after the SEC sued Binance, the world\'s largest crypto exchange, and its billionaire founder, Changpeng Zhao. On June 5, the agency filed 13 charges against them both, which included allegations that Zhao and his exchange worked to "secretly allow high-value U.S. customers" to continue trading on its unregulated international exchange despite publicly claiming that U.S. customers were restricted from doing so, according to the June 5 press release. Zhao has dismissed the charges on Twitter.\n\nWhat the SEC\'s crackdown on crypto may mean for investors\n\n"The harsh messaging coming from the agency and its Chair Gary Gensler is a sign the SEC may be doing exactly what many in the industry have believed: shut down crypto in the U.S.," Chen Arad, co-founder and chief experience officer of Solidus Labs, a company that provides tools to help crypto exchanges and institutions prevent market manipulation, tells CNBC Make It. The U.S. remains a core market for crypto firms. About 20% of Americans say they\'ve invested in, traded or used cryptocurrency, per a January NBC News poll, and around 42% of Americans between the ages of 18 and 34 say they\'ve dabbled in crypto trading. Still, platforms may prefer to avoid the potential regulatory risks involved in operating here and shift their focus to countries with clearer legal requirements, Arad says. Omid Malekan, an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School and author of "Re-Architecting Trust: The Curse of History and the Crypto Cure for Money, Markets, and Platforms," agrees. Some crypto firms may choose limit which services they offer to U.S. customers due to the complicated regulatory framework, he tells CNBC Make It. "That\'s bad for U.S. investors," he says. "It means that they\'ll have less options and are probably going to have to pay higher fees." Malekan owns Coinbase stock and is a longtime Coinbase customer. There is a potential upside to the SEC\'s latest enforcement action against crypto exchanges. Now that the lawsuits have been filed, the platforms can respond to the allegations in an open court and the public will be able to listen in, Arad says. But don\'t expect crypto traders to make a mass exodus from various exchanges any time soon, Malekan says. "The people who are going to stay away or leave already have," he says. "Those who are still left and investing and using services like Coinbase are probably OK with the risks that are involved." Although the ongoing regulatory dynamic in the U.S. can have some effect on demand, the people who want to buy crypto will continue to find ways to do so, Arad says, and using established crypto exchanges that are regulated in the U.S. is still one of the best and safest ways.\n\nDoes the suit affect bitcoin specifically?\n\nBitcoin, one of the most well-known cryptocurrencies, wasn\'t named in the SEC\'s complaint. Bitcoin has been determined to be a commodity under the Commodity Exchange Act, which means, typically, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulates it, according to the agency\'s website. There\'s a general understanding within the industry that if you\'re just trading bitcoin, you\'re probably OK, Malekan says. Cryptocurrency prices briefly rose following the SEC\'s announcement. On June 6, bitcoin prices climbed to a little above $27,100, according to Coin Metrics. As of June 12 at 11:09am EST, bitcoin had fallen to around $25,800, per Coin Metrics.\n\nThe state of crypto platform regulation in the U.S.\n...'}, {'id': 2, 'time': 'Mon, 12 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Bitcoin NFTs raise unique legal issues. Here's what you need to know - Yahoo Finance", 'content': 'While non-fungible tokens (NFTs) originally gained popularity on smart-contract platforms such as Ethereum and Solana, creators can now mint and transfer digital artifacts on the Bitcoin blockchain. But even though outwardly all those NFTs seem similar, the differences in how these digital assets are minted raise different intellectual property law issues — in particular, regarding the patent eligibility of applications related to NFTs.\n\nInvestors as well as NFT creators and buyers alike should be aware of these differences, to make sure they are protected by IP laws as well as beware of limitations, to decrease the likelihood of a potential infringer being able to avoid liability.\n\nDifferences between Bitcoin and smart-contract NFTs\n\nBitcoin NFTs are created in a much different way than NFTs on other blockchains. For example, NFTs can be inscribed into the Bitcoin blockchain as Ordinals. To inscribe an Ordinal, a user sends a transaction to a Taproot address and includes an asset/digital artifact such as a text or an image in the witness data section of the transaction. The witness data section can store up to 4 MB of data, which is generally large enough for most images and other digital artifacts.\n\nBut Ordinals aren’t the only way to mint NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain. Alternatively, users can mint NFTs using the STAMPS (Secure Tradeable Art Maintained Securely) protocol, which stores digital artifacts within the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) portion of the transaction. Proponents of the STAMPS protocol argue that because witness data can be pruned over time, Ordinals are not immutable.\n\nBy including an encoding of a digital artifact within the UTXO portion of the transaction, the digital artifact cannot be pruned from the Bitcoin blockchain. Also, instead of using the order in which a Satoshi was mined as a unique identifier for the digital artifact, the STAMPS protocol includes an asset identifier in the UTXO with the digital artifact. When the asset identifier is transferred to another user, the user takes ownership of the digital artifact.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe user also sends a Satoshi (1/100,000,000th of a Bitcoin) in the transaction, where each Satoshi is numbered in the order in which it was mined. For example, the first Satoshi ever mined is Ordinal number 1, the millionth Satoshi mined is ordinal number 1,000,000, and so on. The Satoshi (identified by its ordinal number) is then associated with the digital artifact so that the Ordinal number acts as a unique identifier on the Bitcoin blockchain for the digital artifact. Then when the user transfers the satoshi, the recipient becomes the owner of the digital artifact.\n\nBitcoin NFTs are also structured differently than other types of NFTs. For example, other types of NFTs are typically created with a unique token identifier and an associated set of properties, such as a name, a link to a digital image, etc. On the other hand, a user does not create a unique token identifier or a token at all when inscribing an Ordinal. Instead, the digital asset is inscribed with an existing Satoshi.\n\nArguably, the Satoshi does not have a unique token identifier, as it is originally mined as a fungible token which then takes on some non-fungible properties by being numbered in the order it was mined. Recently, developers have created a protocol using Ordinals for BRC-20 tokens, which is a reference to Ethereum’s ERC-20 tokens. These BRC-20 tokens are fungible tokens created and transferred using Ordinals, thereby adding further confusion when determining the fungibility of a Satoshi used to inscribe fungible tokens.\n\nAlso, the Satoshi does not have off-chain metadata like an NFT on other blockchains, which includes a set of properties of the NFT. Instead, the digital artifact is directly inscribed into the witness data section (or the UTXO section in the STAMPS protocol) of a transaction.\n\nLegal ramifications of NFT differences\n\nPatents that only describe NFTs as they exist on smart-contract platforms (e.g., having a unique identifier and a set of properties that describes the digital artifact that they represent) may be vulnerable to a design around by a potential infringer that alters their software so that digital artifacts are minted and transferred on the Bitcoin blockchain instead of on Ethereum, Solana, or another smart contract platform. If the patent claims some use of NFTs, the potential infringer may argue that their digital artifacts on the Bitcoin blockchain are not NFTs since they may not have a unique token identifier, may not be represented by a non-fungible token, and/or do not have off-chain metadata.\n\nAccordingly, it is important to consider including a description of Bitcoin NFTs as well as smart contract platform NFTs in the patent description. For example, NFTs can be defined to include any digital artifact stored on a blockchain or referenced by a blockchain (in the case where a smart-contract platform NFT includes a link to the digita...'}]

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain, news, and reflection analyst reports, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing uncertainty with fluctuating trends. The on-chain data shows mixed signals from indicators and fluctuations in various metrics, indicating a lack of clear direction. On the other hand, the news analyst report suggests a positive outlook for Bitcoin, with potential bullish movements due to factors like in-house custody transitions and the upcoming halving event.

In reflecting on recent trading performance, it is evident that a cautious and long-term strategy has been more effective in navigating the volatile market. Prioritizing long-term gains over short-term profits has proven to be beneficial in managing risks and optimizing profitability.

Gary Gensler at the S.E.C. seems to want to stop any crypto companies in their tracks and either have them close their businesses down completely or move offshore. How do you think how do you think it's all playing out? Well, I think MicroStrategy is view since 2020 has been that the only institutional grade investable assets in the crypto space is bitcoin. Bitcoin is the universally, globally acknowledged digital commodity in this industry. I think it's pretty clear that the regulators don't see a legitimate path forward for crypto currencies like the stable coins, crypto securities, like the tokens mentioned. They don't they don't have any love for crypto derivatives. They don't have any love for crypto tokens. And and they have a view of crypto exchanges, which is of far constrained. I mean, their view is crypto exchanges should change, which should trade and and hold a pure digital commodities like Bitcoin. And so the entire industry is kind of destined to be rationalised down to a bitcoin focused industry with maybe a half a dozen to a dozen other other proof of work tokens. So, Michael, what happens then to the exchanges in the US, at least it seems? You know, if they're only going to offer trading in Bitcoin or other, you know, clearly pure commodity tokens, that's not going to be a great business model. Do exchanges in the US just go away? I take a different point of view there. I think there's been a lot of confusion because of the 25000 other cryptos and because of of all of the crypto securities that have been angling to position himself as the next bitcoin or a better bitcoin. So now I think that the public is beginning to realize that bitcoin is the next Bitcoin. The next logical step is for bitcoin to 10x from here and then 10x again. So eventually I have confidence that the crypto exchanges will come around to realizing that Bitcoin really is the dominant asset in this space and their business models are fine. When bitcoin goes up by a factor of 10 and you know, we can see that the dominance of bitcoin and the crypto economy as measured by coin market cap has moved from 40 to 48 percent this year alone. But I think that is the stable coins and the tokens go away that long term dominance is headed for 80 percent. And I think what you got to remember is the reason that we don't have mega institutional money flowing into this space is confusion and anxiety. When that disappears, you're going to see mega amounts of money flow into space and the business models will be just fine focused on Bitcoin. Michael, I want to ask what the future of some of these centralized exchanges does look like right now, because to your point that maybe once that confusion clears up, more institutions will come in. When you have a company like Coinbase, obviously there's a big regulatory overhang right now for normal investors in the space, not the big institutions. Do you see them moving away from these sort of centralized exchanges, maybe gravitating more towards cold wallets from here? Well, you know, I I think that there is a massive need for exchanges to help people acquire Bitcoin in custody, bitcoin, especially as the pension funds, the insurance companies, the banks, the institutional investors get into the space. Companies like grayscale need to have a custodian. So. So I see a lot of bullish things for bitcoin on the horizon. I think the accounting treatment, the upcoming having the explosion and the half hour hash rate and also the clarity that has come out of the S.E.C. of late is actually laying the foundation for the next bull run. And and there is a place for crypto exchanges to help people buy bitcoins, sell bitcoin, custody, bitcoin, and. And I don't think that's going away. I think that's going to be a great business. Michael, how does MicroStrategy actually accumulate its bitcoin and has that process changed at all? We use a variety of of institutional grade bitcoin companies, we work with Coinbase and we have work with Coinbase. We have a number of institutional grade custodians as well. MicroStrategy has been kind of special in this regard because unlike, say, an ETF or the like, we're able to access the Bitcoin spot markets and hold Bitcoin. And we're also able to access the equity in the debt markets as we pursue our Bitcoin acquisition strategy. How is. I mean, you've outperformed Beto and Gray Scale and other, you know, ETF exchange traded products year to date. How how is your strategy, though, in your company different from one of these, you know, products that just hold large amounts of bitcoin? Well, we're an operating company, so we have a profitable software business and so we can sweep the cash flows of our software business into Bitcoin. Our aim is, is to allow institutional investors to get bitcoin exposure, but without charging them a fee and generating a yield when we can. And because we're able..."}, {'id': 43, 'time': 'Tue, 13 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Marathon Digital CEO Expects More Bitcoin Miner Deals - Bloomberg', 'content': "00:00\n\nYou have a lot of crypto companies saying that they're looking overseas, that they're looking to get out of the US. What's Marathon's view? Are you looking at offshore opportunities here? Well, we recently announced a new project in the UAE where we're building one of the largest digital asset operations or mining in Abu Dhabi. We're also looking in other places. Our goal, a longer term is to be about 50 percent offshore, 50 percent onshore. Bitcoin is treated a little bit differently than broader crypto. The SCC and the CFTC have both given it clarity that Bitcoin is a commodity. It's not a security. So Bitcoin is being treated a little bit differently and I think the situation around Bitcoin is different. That being said, clearly, you know, all the way up to the top at the White House, the economic report that they issued in January had a very different tone than the one they issued prior year. So clearly this is coming from the top that crypto is bad in their views. But we're very hopeful that the legislation that is going through Congress now will hopefully add some market structure guidelines and alleviate some of the lack of clarity that exists today so that the regulators can operate in a more friendly way towards the industry that will allow people to innovate, build businesses in the US as opposed to just moving offshore. Is there any hope, Fred, in kind of fighting this crackdown from the S.E.C. in the court of public opinion? I mean, you mentioned legislation. Obviously, that's, I guess, the main mechanism through which you you would change the FTSE mandate, because so many of these coins, you can argue that they're a commodity and not a security. So I think part of the challenge is that with no clear legal rules, legislation around this, the FCC mandate is seemingly a little broader than it should be. There have been some mentions of overreach. I think there is a Republican member of the House that has put forth a bill that essentially would restructure the FCC. So I think momentum is building towards people really starting to pay attention to this at the end of the day. Congress needs to provide very clear legislation. And then I think the FCC and the CFTC have to come to terms regarding how this is all going to be regulated. But, you know, a lot of this is definitely potentially a bit of strong arming. You think about what the FCC is doing by essentially scaring people enough. They will achieve the end that they're looking for, which is to move all this off shore. You look at all these coins that have been delisted by exchanges. You look at Robinhood Hood listing all coins and stopping trading in crypto. You know, essentially the S.E.C. is achieving its end without having to take all these people were caught. So it's a matter of who gets to the finish line first and what happens come next year. You we have three presidential candidates who have come out on the Republican side that are pro bitcoin. And I think momentum, again, is building for at least a more positive environment for bitcoin in the US. But we'll have to see what Congress can do to really rein things in and get everybody aligned around how things should operate so people can get back to business. You mentioned Robin Hood. We've also seen E Toro stop new purchases of these tainted 19 coins, so to speak. Are you also avoiding any any tokens that the S.E.C. has deemed securities? Well, we're a pure Bitcoin company. So in our case, we focus on Bitcoin. It's been declared a commodity by both the SCC and the CFTC. So we're continuing just business as usual. And Fred, I'd love to get your thoughts on the mining industry. Take a step back and talk about the state of Bitcoin mining, because obviously Bitcoin had a great 20 twenty three up well over 50 percent, but still down dramatically from its peaks. What does that mean for your margins? What is your current break even rate look like and how does that compare to the rest of the industry? The industry has been going through a big upgrade cycle. There's some recent reports that have been issued that show that energy consumption is maintaining at the same level. But at the same time, the global hash rate or the amount of compute power that's applied to bitcoin mining has increased substantially. We've grown substantially. We've doubled our capacity year to date over the end of last year and will continue to grow at more throughout this year. We're using the most modern, most energy efficient machines. What we're seeing is miners that had older machines have been upgrading those to more energy efficient machines, which is making the overall industry more energy efficient. So I think people are continued to grow. Margins are essentially staying flat to a little bit lower because as global hash rate grows, the difficult. The increases, but Bitcoin prices obviously moved in the right direction this year. So I think what we're going to see is a slow uptick in the price of Bitcoin over t..."}]

Additionally, the limited supply and the decentralized nature of Bitcoin contribute to its perceived value and the potential for price appreciation over time.\n\nUtilizing blockchain technology in Bitcoin transactions ensures transparency and immutability, thereby rendering the alteration or manipulation of transaction records a challenging task.\n\nFurthermore, Bitcoin has gained attention as an alternative investment and a diversification tool. It has attracted interest from institutional investors, hedge funds, and even some governments. This growing acceptance and adoption of Bitcoin have led to the emergence of regulated exchanges, investment products, and services around cryptocurrency.\n\nEnrico Rubboli, the CEO of Mintlayer, told Nasdaq, “Investment firms recognize Bitcoin\'s potential as a store of value and inflation hedge. With its limited supply and decentralized nature, Bitcoin is seen by some as a way to preserve wealth in the face of inflationary pressures and currency devaluation. This appeal is particularly relevant given the unprecedented monetary stimulus measures central banks adopt worldwide.”\n\nHowever, it is also important to note that Bitcoin also faces challenges and criticisms. Its price volatility, regulatory uncertainties, and concerns about its use in illicit activities have raised questions about its stability and long-term viability as a mainstream currency. Nonetheless, Bitcoin has undeniably disrupted traditional financial systems and sparked a broader interest in blockchain technology.\n\nIt has stimulated innovation in various industries beyond finance, including supply chain management, voting systems, and decentralized applications. The potential for old institutions to change, for people to gain financial independence, and for the global economy to challenge the status quo of centralized control make Bitcoin significant in the financial world.\n\nInstitutional adoption of Bitcoin: Key players and their motivations\n\nInstitutional adoption of Bitcoin has seen significant growth, with key players from various sectors embracing cryptocurrency. These players include financial institutions, technology companies, and investment firms, each driven by unique motivations.\n\nFinancial institutions, including banks and asset management companies, have been actively exploring Bitcoin adoption. Their motivations include:\n\nDiversification and Portfolio Management: Financial institutions seek to diversify their investment portfolios by including Bitcoin. They view cryptocurrencies as an alternative asset class that can potentially provide attractive returns and reduce overall portfolio risk. Client Demand and Retention: Many clients have expressed interest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Financial institutions aim to meet this demand and retain their clients by offering cryptocurrency-related services and investment opportunities. Failing to address this demand could result in losing clients to competitors. Hedge Against Economic Uncertainty: Some financial institutions view Bitcoin as a potential hedge against economic uncertainty and inflation. They perceive Bitcoin\'s decentralized nature and limited supply as features that can protect against the devaluation of traditional currencies and safeguard wealth.\n\nRubboli shared his views on institutional investors\' interests in Bitcoin, telling Nasdaq "Investment firms, including hedge funds and institutional investors, have been attracted to Bitcoin for various reasons. Firstly, the potential for significant returns has been a major motivation."\n\n"Bitcoin has demonstrated remarkable price appreciation over the years, and some investment firms view it as an opportunity to generate alpha and outperform traditional markets. The volatility of Bitcoin, although a risk, can also provide substantial profit opportunities for those with the expertise to navigate the market."\n\nTechnology Companies: Technology companies, particularly those involved in payment processing and digital services, have shown interest in Bitcoin adoption. Their motivations include:\n\nInnovation and Market Expansion: Technology companies strive to stay at the forefront of emerging trends and technologies. By incorporating Bitcoin into th...'}]
