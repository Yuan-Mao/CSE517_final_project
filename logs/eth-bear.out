Still, “there’s always risks” when one reshuffles the deck like this.\n\nEthereum’s stakers and validators will shortly be able to withdraw $32 billion of Ether from the Beacon Chain, which accounts for about 15% of the ETH’s circulating supply, according to Coinbase’s April 5 newsletter. Some worry that the upgrade, also known as the Shanghai hard fork, may lower the overall number of validators and put selling pressure on the network, among other concerns.\n\n“Every hard fork brings some upgrade risk,” Paul Brody, EY’s global blockchain leader, told Cointelegraph, especially in cases like this where you’re enabling withdrawals. On the technical side, there could be bugs latent since “day zero” in some of the network’s staking smart contracts, for example, that may not emerge until the withdrawal date — though Brody doesn’t think that’s likely.\n\nThe upgrade should mitigate risks for investors. “Lower volatility plus a yield makes for a more familiar and less risky asset to hold long-term,” Rich Rosenblum, co-founder and president at GSR, a crypto market-making firm, told Cointelegraph.\n\nMore institutional investors?\n\nWill Shapella really attract more institutional investors to the blockchain, as some believe? Research and brokerage firm AB Bernstein stated in a late-February research report that the upgrade could bring in staking from new institutional investors, and Blockdaemon’s Zwanzger, whose firm has many institutional clients, foresees more interest in Ethereum staking opportunities from large professional investors. Some institutional investors have been reluctant to lock up funds without a clear withdrawal option.\n\n“There’s probably going to be a queue for the first couple of weeks,” Zwanzger said. “So they might be better off waiting until that comes down to normal levels.”\n\nAccording to Rosenblum, “Once the PoS network is fully operational, more institutions will feel comfortable holding ETH, especially once the staking yield becomes more accessible.”\n\nEY’s Brody, on the other hand, doesn’t see much of a change. “A lot of the big institutional investors that we know and work with are basically sitting on the sidelines. They want to comply, but they want to be more comfortable that they know what the rules are.” Comprehensive crypto reform legislation in the United States would probably be more likely to get them off the sidelines.\n\nLonger-term risks\n\nSo what about regulatory risk, particularly in the United States? For years Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether were thought to be impervious to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) scrutiny, with many U.S. regulators tacitly agreeing that the native coins for decentralized systems like these were more like commodities than securities, placing them under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s jurisdiction. But with Ethereum’s move to a staking validation mechanism, some think the SEC may now have Ethereum in its sights.\n\nStill, “I wouldn’t consider it a significant risk for the network,” even if that happens, said Zwanzger. The Ethereum protocol is global, and not all jurisdictions will likely share the SEC’s view of what needs regulating. Of course, other countries could ultimately choose to follow the U.S., so one never knows.\n\nOthers worry that Ethereum’s move to staking may herald increasing network centralization. In March, Cointelegraph reported that “concentration of ETH staked through third parties raises concerns over decentralization at Lido and Coinbase in particular.”\n\nRecent: Crypto audits and bug bounties are broken: Here’s how to fix them\n\n“The battle to keep Ethereum sufficiently and properly decentralized is probably one of the most important ones out there in terms of governance and organization,” Brody to..."}]

*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
After analyzing the reports from the on-chain analyst, news analyst, and reflection analyst, it is evident that there are mixed signals in the ETH market. The on-chain analyst report indicates a bearish trend due to high gas prices and a sell signal from the MACD indicator. On the other hand, the news analyst report suggests a bullish short-term trend with positive momentum from the Shanghai upgrade and institutional interest. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of monitoring market trends and taking a conservative approach in the current volatile market.

Considering the conflicting signals and the overall uncertainty in the market, it is crucial to adopt a long-term strategy focused on risk management rather than short-term gains. It is advisable to stay disciplined, patient, and cautious in making trading decisions to mitigate potential risks and preserve capital.

Given the mixed signals and the need for a conservative approach, I would take a neutral trading action with a confidence level of 0.0. This decision reflects the uncertainty in the market and the importance of waiting for clearer opportunities to arise before making significant trades. By staying neutral and monitoring the market closely, I aim to navigate the current market conditions prudently and position myself for long-term success in ETH trading.

ETH is up 1.1% versus 24 hours earlier.\n\nAnalysts were divided on potential price action in the lead up to the upgrade, with many predicting that fresh supply would increase sell pressure while others thought it may become a psychological battle where traders punish the over-crowded short trade.\n\nIn an email to CoinDes, Brent Xu, CEO of cross-chain decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Umee wrote that he didn\'t expect a big decline for ETH or related LSTs in the near future.\n\n"The momentum is just too powerful," Xu wrote. "Right now, there are many institutions holding ETH and LSTs. Retail basically isn\'t in the picture, and retail would be the ones who would dump at this moment. But the institutions won\'t really be impacted by this upgrade because their investing time horizons are longer term."\n\nUPDATE (April 12, 2023, 23:44 UTC): Adds Xu quote.\n\n\n\n'}, {'id': 39, 'time': 'Wed, 12 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'More Than $300 Million in Ethereum Will Be Sold After Shanghai, Analysts Say - Yahoo Finance', 'content': 'Analysts at Glassnode estimate that roughly 170,000 Ethereum, worth approximately $326 million, will be sold following today\'s highly anticipated Shanghai upgrade.\n\nThe upgrade, also known by its consensus layer name "Capella," will finally let users withdraw ETH that has been locked up on the Ethereum network over the last two years.\n\nEthereum began its transition to a proof-of-stake network in December 2020, enabling validators and other interested stakers to begin earning passive rewards on ETH pledged to the network. It completed the transition last September following the "merge," an upgrade that combined the Ethereum mainnet with the proof-of-stake beacon chain.\n\nUsers who\'ve staked their Ethereum, however, haven\'t been able to withdraw their initial deposits or rewards. But all that changes later today.\n\nGlassnode researchers today stated in a report that of the newly unlocked sum, approximately 70,000 ETH will come from validators exiting the network, pulling their staked holdings with them. The report indicates that there are 253 depositors waiting to do precisely this, but analysts added that "withdrawals are most likely related to a change in their technical setup, rather than exiting their position."\n\nThe remaining 100,000 ETH is expected to come from users withdrawing their staking rewards to sell on the market. Glassnode analysts said they only expect roughly $133 million worth of ETH to "actually become liquid" following the activation of withdrawals.\n\nProof-of-stake networks work by having validators secure the network, as opposed to miners on proof-of-work blockchains like Bitcoin. Anyone can become a validator on Ethereum by staking 32 ETH (roughly $60,000) and begin earning rewards for doing so. If a validator acts maliciously, they face a penalty known as "slashing" that deducts ETH from their staked sum.\n\nDespite projecting upwards of $326 million in Ethereum potentially hitting the market, Glassnode\'s report concludes that the move "is expected to be a lot less dramatic than many have painted it to be," adding that should the Shanghai upgrade go off without a hitch, it "will bolster a growing staking industry."\n\nStory continues\n\nIt\'s also worth noting that withdrawal requests will enter a queue, and not all withdrawal requests will be processed on day one. Individual stakers may have to wait at least two or three days before receiving their funds, and stakers making use of pooling services such as Lido or centralized providers like Coinbase might need to wait weeks if not months. This means that any ETH being withdrawn from the staking contract won\'t hit the market all at once.\n\nWho\'s selling staked Ethereum?\n\nOther analysts, including CoinShares research associate Marc Arjoon, agree that the effects of Shanghai on the Ethereum market will likely be muted in the short term.\n\nArjoon told Decrypt that this has a lot do with liquid staking solutions such as Lido Finance\n\nThough withdrawals for Lido Finance are also contingent on withdrawals on Ethereum also becoming available, users have been able to swap their staked Ethereum tokens (stETH) for ETH on exchanges like Curve Finance.\n\nWhen depositing Ethereum on a liquid staking platform, users get an equivalent staked version of Ethereum that can be used elsewhere in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi), such us non-custodial lending and trading platforms.\n\nWhy Ethereum Bulls Are Turning to LSD\n\n"If those takers wanted to exit the market, they could simply sell their tokens on the secondary market for a one-to-one ratio," he told Decrypt.\n\nArjoon also believes that many of the "tech-savvy" stakers who have the 32 ETH needed to become validators are unlikely to sell their stashes.\n\n"They decided to stake their ETH with an indefinite lockup period, and that\'s likely because they believe in using ETH as a store of value," said Arjoon. "That’s why I also think that that cohort majority is unlikely to sell.”\n\nSo who\'s dumping their staked ETH? "Different entities like businesses, colleges, and other things that just can\'t be identified using the [wallet] addresses," are the most likely to sell, said Arjoon. "To be conservative, I would say that 50% of those entities would withdraw and sell their ETH."\n\nThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.'}]

The completion of Ethereum's Shanghai upgrade has not significantly impacted the price of ETH, which is currently trading around $1,914. Analysts predict that approximately $326 million worth of Ethereum will be sold following the upgrade, with a portion coming from validators exiting the network and the rest from users withdrawing their staking rewards. Despite the potential influx of ETH into the market, experts believe that the impact on the market will be muted in the short term, as many long-term stakers are unlikely to sell their holdings.

On the other hand, the news analyst report suggests a bullish short-term trend with positive momentum from the Shanghai upgrade and institutional interest. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of monitoring market trends and taking a conservative approach in the current volatile market.

Considering the conflicting signals and the overall uncertainty in the market, it is crucial to adopt a long-term strategy focused on risk management rather than short-term gains. It is advisable to stay disciplined, patient, and cautious in making trading decisions to mitigate potential risks and preserve capital.

Given the mixed signals and the need for a conservative approach, I would take a neutral trading action with a confidence level of 0.0. This decision reflects the uncertainty in the market and the importance of waiting for clearer opportunities to arise before making significant trades. By staying neutral and monitoring the market closely, I aim to navigate the current market conditions prudently and position myself for long-term success in ETH trading.

NEWS ANALYST REPORT:
"""
The completion of Ethereum's Shanghai upgrade has not significantly impacted the price of ETH, which is currently trading around $1,914. Analysts predict that approximately $326 million worth of Ethereum will be sold following the upgrade, with a portion coming from validators exiting the network and the rest from users withdrawing their staking rewards. Despite the potential influx of ETH into the market, experts believe that the impact on the market will be muted in the short term, as many long-term stakers are unlikely to sell their holdings. The overall sentiment suggests that the market trend for ETH may remain stable or experience minimal fluctuations in the near future.

Because obviously, we\'re seeing at least today, Ethereum off to the races here versus Bitcoin. I mean, up about almost 6% on the day. What are your takeaways from that? Obviously, a lot of excitement surrounding this.\n\nSCOTT MELKER: Yeah, there was a bit of a nonsensical narrative that everybody who had staked their Ethereum for the past few years was going to try to withdraw all at once, which you couldn\'t do anyways, and sell all their Ethereum. But you have to remember that anyone who staked their 30 to Ethereum, which by the way, for most people, was over $60,000. But anyone who staked that 30 to Ethereum had no guarantee they would even be able to withdraw.\n\nThese are the people who are the biggest believers, the maximalists of Ethereum, who really wanted to help secure the network. So now that they\'re getting the opportunity to withdraw, they\'re going to continue staking. I think there were more people. And I can speak to this anecdotally from fund managers that I speak to in institutions.\n\nThere are a lot more people who are actually waiting to deposit because they would then know that they would be able to withdraw at some point. So we\'re actually seeing net inflows over the past 24 hours. It\'s going back and forth. But there has not been a huge demand for people to withdraw. And there are just as many people putting their money into the contract. I think that this is a huge development for Ethereum. Yet another major step in the right direction for the protocol.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: And do you think perhaps investors are more bullish on Ethereum given the use cases versus Bitcoin?\n\nSCOTT MELKER: I view them as completely separate assets. I think that the flipping narrative is completely irrelevant. I view Bitcoin as a digital gold, store of value, flight to safety. And we\'ve obviously seen that, especially, with the banking collapses a few months ago, and Bitcoin rise a few weeks ago. With Bitcoin rising from roughly 19,000 to over $30,000, Ethereum is more of a technological investment. It\'s a internet of value. And I think that we\'re starting to see that separation in people\'s minds. So I think you can love one, love both, and it\'s totally fine. You don\'t have to really choose. I think that they\'re separate asset classes and should be viewed as such.'}]

The ETH cryptocurrency has shown a consistent increase in open price from 1892.94 to 2102.95, indicating a bullish trend. However, the average gas price has fluctuated between 26818315709.0 and 35563190355.0, suggesting volatility in transaction costs. The total value transferred has also increased steadily from 1.14277e+24 to 2.07505e+24, reflecting growing market activity.

Everything You Need to Know - CryptoPotato', 'content': 'Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade, also commonly referred to as Shapella (we’ll explain why below), took place on April 12th.\n\nIt was a major upgrade following Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake (a.k.a The Merge), and it introduced a major mechanic change.\n\nThe upgrade consists of a few Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), although most of the focus is on one particular.\n\nThe EIPs in question are:\n\nEIP-3651 : Warm COINBASE\n\n: Warm COINBASE EIP-3855 : PUSH0 instruction\n\n: PUSH0 instruction EIP-3860 : Limit and meter initcode\n\n: Limit and meter initcode EIP-4895 : Beacon chain push withdrawals as operations\n\n: Beacon chain push withdrawals as operations EIP-6049: Deprecate SELFDESTRUCT\n\nWith that in mind, let’s take a closer look and understand why the Shanghai upgrade is so important.\n\nWhat is the Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade?\n\nEthereum’s Shanghai upgrade is arguably one of the most important events in the crypto industry in 2023.\n\nBefore we dive in, did you know that it’s also commonly referred to as the Ethereum Shapella upgrade? The name comes from Shanghai – the city-host of the Devcon 2 conference, and Capella – the brightest star in the northern constellation of Auriga.\n\nAs we know from our guide on Ethereum’s Merge (the transition to Proof-of-Stake), the network has two layers – the execution layer and the consensus layer. The former used to be the main one that Ethereum ran on before The Merge, while the consensus layer was also known as the Beacon Chain.\n\nWith that in mind, the upgrade took part on both layers. Shanghai happened on the execution layer, while Capella – was on the consensus one. Combining both names gives us “Shapella.” However, the Shanghai name remains more prevalent, so for the sake of simplicity, we will use it in the guide going forward.\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade introduced a pivotal mechanic in Ethereum’s network, and while there are many EIPs (as seen above), one of them is critical. Namely, this is EIP- 4895.\n\nWhat is EIP-4895 in the Shanghai Upgrade?\n\nWhile it’s currently running on PoS, Ethereum was using the proof-of-work consensus algorithm well before The Merge took place, But the plans to transition were in play for many years when developers created the so-called Beacon Chain.\n\nThe Beacon Chain was (and still is) secured by PoS. To maintain its integrity, allow it to function as intended, and carry out transactions and smart contracts, it needed validators – just like any other PoS-based blockchains where miners do not exist.\n\nTherefore, those who wanted to partake in the future of the so-called Ethereum 2.0 were able to stake 32 ETH to secure the Beacon chain. The ETH was staked in the Beacon Depositor contract. Validators would then earn interest on their ETH – a reward for securing the network during this development stage.\n\nThe only catch? Well, they weren’t allowed to unstake their 32 ETH until a later, undetermined date. It’s taken years for the team to successfully deliver The Merge, and now, the Shanghai upgrade, through EIP-4895, finally allowed validators to unlock their ETH.\n\nThis guide is not intended as a technical walkthrough, so if you want to learn more about how the mechanic will become possible, please take a look at the official website page for EIP-4895.\n\nIn essence, the goal was to:\n\nIntroduce a system-level “operation” to support validator withdrawals that are “pushed” from the beacon chain to the EVM. These operations create unconditional balance increases to the specified recipients.\n\nThe Beacon depositor contract, as mentioned above, contained about 18 million ETH, which accounted for roughly 15% of the total circulating supply.\n\nValidators are now free to withdraw, albeit with some considerations, their stake and do whatever they decide with it – it becomes entirely liquid. That made this particular EIP very important.\n\nHow do ETH Withdrawals Work?\n\nAs mentioned above, there are some considerations when withdrawals were opened. First things first, there are two types of them – full and partial. Full withdrawals allow validators to exit their stake completely, taking their entire balance of ETH, including the original 32 ETH, as well as any rewards they may have accrued.\n\nPartial withdrawals only allow validators to access the excess (balances over the 32 ETH) needed to run a validator node.\n\nWithin every single block that’s added to the network, 16 validators are able to make partial withdrawals.\n\nIn essence, a total of 1,800 validators can unstake fully.\n\nOther Ethereum Improvement Proposals in the Shanghai Upgrade\n\nThe other proposed improvements were aimed at reducing gas fees during periods of very high network congestion and activity.\n\nEIP-3651 aims to lower the gas costs that are associated with the maximal Extractable Value payments when accessing the COINBASE address. In this particular sense of the word, COINBASE refers to a solution that allows developers to receive new tokens and not the popular US-based exchange.\n\nEIP-3855 is designed to ...'}]

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
After analyzing the reports from the on-chain analyst, news analyst, and reflection analyst, it is evident that there are mixed signals in the ETH market. The on-chain analyst report indicates a bearish trend due to high gas prices and a sell signal from the MACD indicator. On the other hand, the news analyst report suggests a bullish short-term trend with positive momentum from the Shanghai upgrade and institutional interest. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of monitoring market trends and taking a conservative approach in the current volatile market.

Considering the conflicting signals and the overall uncertainty in the market, it is crucial to adopt a long-term strategy focused on risk management rather than short-term gains. It is advisable to stay disciplined, patient, and cautious in making trading decisions to mitigate potential risks and preserve capital.

Given the mixed signals and the need for a conservative approach, I would take a neutral trading action with a confidence level of 0.0. This decision reflects the uncertainty in the market and the importance of waiting for clearer opportunities to arise before making significant trades. By staying neutral and monitoring the market closely, I aim to navigate the current market conditions prudently and position myself for long-term success in ETH trading.
ACTION:
0.0
DAILY RETURN:
0.007206814715849941
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, we see that the market trend for ETH appears to be bearish due to the decrease in unique addresses and successful transactions, despite an increase in total value transferred. The MACD signal also remains at sell, indicating a bearish trend in the market. Additionally, the news analyst report suggests that the completion of Ethereum's Shanghai upgrade may not significantly impact the price of ETH in the short term, with experts predicting minimal fluctuations in the market.

Reflecting on my recent trading performance and the current market analysis, it is evident that a conservative and risk-averse approach is necessary to navigate the uncertainty in the ETH market. By closely monitoring key trends and maintaining a long-term perspective, I can mitigate potential risks and position myself for success in the long run.

Considering the synthesized reports, I believe that the market trend for ETH is likely to remain bearish in the short term, with minimal fluctuations expected. Therefore, I will take a cautious approach and assign a trading action of -0.5 to reflect my confidence in the bearish trend and my strategic decision to prioritize risk management over short-term gains.
ACTION:
-0.5
DAILY RETURN:
0.011127263955896805
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, we see that there has been a slight increase in the open price of ETH, along with fluctuations in gas prices and total value transferred. The number of unique addresses has also increased, indicating growing interest in the market. However, the MACD signal remains at sell, suggesting a potential bearish trend in the near future. The overall market trend for ETH appears uncertain with a possible downward movement in the short term.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights positive developments in the Ethereum ecosystem, such as the Shanghai software update and the listing of RIPPLEREUM Coin on Uniswap. This has led to a surge in the price of Ether and a bullish sentiment in the broader cryptocurrency market.

Reflecting on the reports, it is clear that a conservative and risk-averse approach has been effective in navigating the uncertainty in the ETH market. By prioritizing risk management over short-term gains and closely monitoring key trends, informed decisions can be made to position for long-term success.

Considering the conflicting signals from the on-chain and news analyst reports, it is important to take a cautious approach. While the news analyst report suggests a potential uptrend in the near term, the on-chain analyst report indicates a bearish trend. Therefore, a conservative trading strategy is warranted to mitigate risks and position for long-term success.

Given the uncertainty in the market, I would take a neutral trading action with a confidence level of 0.0. This reflects a balanced approach to managing risk and uncertainty in the current market conditions.

I think LTC/BTC is very close to a reversal and higher low on daily.”\n\nThe LTC/BTC pair is currently trading at 0.003148 ($95.64).\n\nSmart Contracter then turns his attention toward the leading smart contract platform Ethereum. According to the trader, the fear surrounding the platform’s new Shanghai update, which now allows users to withdraw their staked ETH, is not warranted. He also believes the top altcoin is flashing vibes of Bitcoin’s price action in 2019 when the crypto king surged by about 300% in a few months.\n\n“Still think people are completely overreacting about the ETH Shanghai unlock and all I’m getting is 2019 vibes.”\n\nETH is trading for $2,095 at time of writing, a nearly 1.5% decrease during the last 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

It enables collaborative testing with private mainnet states, creating private chains forked from any mainnet position. #Web3 #DeFi pic.twitter.com/TlK169GeLP — BlockSec (@BlockSecTeam) April 14, 2023\n\nPhalcon Fork aims to provide greater control over work being conducted on testnets, such as transaction testing, analysis and debugging.\n\nIn the user manual, BlockSec touts that this extra control comes from being able to easily “fork arbitrary (transaction) positions and block numbers,” and retain certain “services and states” from the Ethereum mainnet.\n\n“Compared with traditional solutions like Goerli [...], Phalcon Fork has the following advantages: retain services and states from the mainnet, facilitating rapid integration and debugging with other DeFi contracts. [And maintain] full control over block information (e.g., Timestamp, BaseFee, MixDigest),” the Phalcon Fork user manual reads.\n\nWith the toolkit, users can also utilize features such as snapshots, enabling them to save certain blockchain positions and revert back to them at will during their testing processes. The snapshots essentially record the transactions being executed and deployed by the user at a given time.\n\n“The snapshot feature is particularly useful in the following two scenarios: When a user wants to run multiple times of a testing script, he/she just needs to revert to the original snapshot and rerun the script. [Or] When a user wants to save some states and return to them later, he/she can create a snapshot and then revert to this snapshot later,” the manual reads.\n\nPhalcon Fork also has an integrated faucet so users can acquire free fork network Ether (ETH) to conduct transactions on the private chains.\n\nTo directly interact with the chains and execute transactions, Phalcon Fork provides a remote procedure call node called Fork RPC, which can be integrated with Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible development frameworks such as Hardhat, Foundry and Remix or added to MetaMask.\n\nAs it stands, users can only fork from the Ethereum mainnet; however, future support for additional blockchains, such as the BNB Smart Chain and Arbitrum, has been teased.\n\nTeased blockchain support additions. Source: Twitter\n\nApril has been a significant month for Ethereum developers, given that the highly anticipated Shapella hard fork went live on the Ethereum mainnet without a hitch on April 12. A major feature of the upgrade enables Ethereum validators to withdraw staked ETH from the Beacon Chain.\n\nRelated: Less than 1% of staked ETH estimated to be sold after Shapella: Finance Redefined\n\nThe move has been met with positive price action from Ether (ETH), with the asset gaining roughly 12% since April 12, to sit at $2,092 at the time of writing.\n\nSeven-day ETH price chart.

Every time a shiny new blockchain, cryptocurrency, or dApp goes live, it’s almost guaranteed that it has already existed for months on a test network.\n\nLike a shadowy vigilante, testnets expose hidden vulnerabilities and protect the cryptocurrency ecosystem. What many people don’t know about testnets is that there is a litany of benefits to using and exploring them, even if you’re not a developer.\n\nHow is something designed to be valueless so valuable?\n\nWhat are blockchain testnets? Why should everyone use them, and how can I get started?\n\nWhat are Testnets?\n\nA testnet is a valueless, low-risk sandbox environment similar to a main network. Blockchain engineers and smart contract developers use testnets to trial the functionality of their protocols and decentralized applications before deploying them on a mainnet or live blockchain.\n\nBecause a testnet is a separate ledger from its main network, all coins and tokens have no value. Regardless of the market price of Bitcoin (BTC), testnet bitcoin should always be worth $0. As a result, all transaction fees on a testnet are essentially free.\n\nThis is important for DeFi developers on networks like Ethereum (ETH), infamous for expensive gas fees. The Ethereum testnet enables developers to send thousands of transactions for free, which would normally cost tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nWhat Is the Purpose of Test Networks?\n\nThe main purpose of a testnet is to trail contracts and applications in a free environment. This helps developers ensure their applications run smoothly but also helps expose vulnerabilities and potential security issues.\n\nCybersecurity attacks in the crypto space are commonplace, with the on-chain world of DeFi and NFTs being particularly hazardous. White-hat hackers and security auditors use blockchain testnets to find potential faults before contracts get deployed on the mainnet, where an exploit could cost developers, and users like you and me, millions of dollars.\n\nThe cost of failure of a main network like Ethereum or XRP could be devastating. Hence, developers need a secure, valueless environment to make mistakes and break things safely before the public uses them.\n\nDo Testnet Coins Have Any Value?\n\nRemember when I said earlier that testnet coins have no value? The truth is, it’s not so black and white.\n\nDevelopers still need testnet coins, like Goerli Ethereum (gETH), to pay ‘transaction fees’ on the testnet. That means they still have some demand from developers testing decentralized applications.\n\nTestnet coins are collected from faucets, or free sites that ‘drip’ small amounts of test cryptocurrency into a testnet wallet. During periods of high demand, these faucets actually empty their supply of testnet coins, making them a hot commodity on the crypto market. For a brief moment, gETH was trading at over $1.\n\nIn February, a bridge opened between the Goerli Ethereum Testnet and the Ethereum Mainnet. Developers needing gETH can buy testnet Ethereum if the faucets are empty or unavailable.\n\nYou can’t trade gETH on a crypto exchange like Binance or Coinbase, but decentralized exchanges like UniSwap aren’t bound by the same restrictions as their centralized alternatives.\n\nThis was great news for developers and testnet faucet farmers who’ve been collecting gETH for free over time. In fact, one savvy player could even play a Cryptopunk NFT worth over $100,000 with gETH they accumulated for free.\n\nUltimately, testnet coins are intended to be free for everyone and have zero value on the market. That doesn’t mean that there is no demand and that testnet crypto is worthless.\n\nWhy You Should Use a Testnet, Even If You’re Not a Blockchain Developer\n\nEven if buying a Cryptopunk for free isn’t enough of an incentive, the non-developers out there might be thinking:\n\n‘That’s all very interesting, but what does that mean for me, a humble crypto enthusiast?’\n\nThere are plenty of benefits to using a testnet, even if you aren’t building dApps or designing blockchains. Many emerging crypto projects ask community members to trial products on a testnet in exchange for rewards, like token airdrops.\n\nFor example, the Aptos Incentivized Testnet gave anywhere between 150-300 APT tokens to selected users who operated a node validator or minted an NFT on their testnet. These tasks didn’t take long to complete, and participants could claim an airdrop worth over $5,000 at Aptos’ all-time high price.\n\nHow Do I Access A Testnet?\n\nThe good news is that accessing a blockchain testnet is easy. Metamask is a great open-source testnet wallet for any EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) network, like Polygon.\n\nAll you need to do is visit a trusted site like Chainlist and connect your wallet. Then, check the box to ‘Include Testnets’ and search for your chosen network, and the site will automatically configure your testnet account for you.\n\nWhich Blockchain Networks Have a Testnet?\n\nAlmost every blockchain in the cryptocurrency i...'}]

However, as round 2 of withdrawals began, the value of Ethereum withdrawn increased. Round 1 took 4.14 days to complete as validators in the queue were processed.\n\n18,442,455 ETH is currently staked, with a value of $38.5 billion as of press time. As a result,\n\nstaked ETH makes up 15.32% of the total supply, with 33% staked with Lido.\n\nWith withdrawals now open, investors have been withdrawing their initial capital and the earned rewards. Staked Ethereum earns interest over time, and when a validator earns over 32 ETH through rewards, the excess amount does not add to their principal. Instead, it gets withdrawn automatically as a reward payment every few days.\n\nThe chart below shows the vast difference between deposits and withdrawals (rewards and principal funds) since the upgrade.\n\nRewards\n\nStaking rewards began around 15% and were put on a predefined falling curve relative to the number of validator participants until the Merge when the network took over. The current validator reward is 4.33%, including consensus rewards and transaction fees. These rewards spiked to around 5.2% in the days leading up to the upgrade but have since returned to their downward trajectory. Total staking rewards have fallen by 1.4% since the Merge last September when they jumped to 5.8% from 4.3%.\n\nIn addition to the change in deposits, withdrawals, and rewards, the average value of Ethereum staked with validators has reduced since withdrawals opened. As a result, 54.3% of stakers are now in profit with ETH around $2,000.\n\nBullish momentum\n\nUltimately, both the Shanghai and Capella upgrades appear to have been a success, as the network is processing new deposits, principal withdrawals, and reward payments without any significant issues. Furthermore, these actions are being performed on a volume of billions of dollars worth of Ethereum daily.\n\nWhile blockchain networks can certainly still be considered to be in beta in many ways, Ethereum’s ability to undertake such enormous undertakings of live network upgrades without issue is highly encouraging for our burgeoning industry.'}, {'id': 32, 'time': 'Sun, 16 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Is Ethereum staking a potential threat to user privacy? - Cryptopolitan', 'content': 'The Ethereum staking process, which involves validators locking up a specific amount of Ether (ETH) to support the network’s security and earn rewards, has come under scrutiny for its potential IP address privacy issues. Stakeholders in the Ethereum network have raised concerns that the requirement for validators to connect via an Ethereum client exposes their IP addresses, which could reveal their location and identity and pose a security risk.\n\nEthereum staking explained\n\nStaking generally entails securing a certain quantity of cryptocurrency or tokens as collateral to participate in a network and receive rewards. The level of anonymity and privacy for stakers depends on the staking mechanism and platform being used. In some instances, staking necessitates the use of a public IP address, which could disclose the staker’s location and other identifying information. This raises concerns for those who prioritize privacy and wish to remain anonymous while staking.\n\nNumerous staking platforms and protocols implement measures to protect user privacy. Some employ techniques such as onion routing or encryption to obscure the staker’s IP address and maintain anonymity. Additionally, certain platforms enable the use of VPNs or other privacy-oriented tools to enhance anonymity further.\n\nEthereum staking requires validators to hold a specific amount of ETH in a designated wallet to support the network’s security and earn rewards. Validators are responsible for verifying transactions, proposing new blocks, and securing the network by locking up a minimum amount of ETH as collateral. While Ethereum staking provides numerous benefits to the network, it has raised concerns about IP address privacy.\n\nEvery computer participating in the Ethereum network must have a unique IP address to facilitate communication between nodes. Validators must connect to the network and perform their duties using an Ethereum client, such as Prysm, Lighthouse, or Teku. These clients utilize the validator’s IP address to communicate with the network and exchange information.\n\nPrivacy at stake\n\nIP addresses, while crucial for network communication, can reveal the location and identity of the validator. Hackers or malicious actors could exploit IP addresses to launch attacks or gain unauthorized access to a validator’s system. Additionally, governments or law enforcement agencies could use IP addresses to locate validators involved in illegal activities.\n\nRecent criticisms focus on Ethereum (ETH), which underwent a hard fork not long ago. An Ethereum Foundation researcher disclosed that ETH stakers’ IP addresses are monitored as part of a broader metadata set, sparking privacy concerns.

Those assets can include real estate, luxury items, watches, vintage cars, etc. Collateral Network (COLT) will use the real-world assets mentioned and mint NFTs that represent them which are 100% asset-backed, allowing lenders to finance the loans by buying a fraction of the fractionalized NFT.\n\nFor example, a person can put their luxury watch as collateral for a loan. Collateral Network (COLT) will then get the watch from that person and turn it into an NFT and sell it in fractions. Then, lenders can buy fractions of the NFT to earn interest. Once the borrower repays the loan, COLT will burn the NFT and redeem the watch from its vault.\n\nAt the moment, Collateral Network (COLT) is in stage 2 of its public presale. Even so, experts believe it is on the path to seeing a 3500% growth, which will bring 35x gains to all Collateral Network (COLT) holders.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nWith the Shanghai update around the corner, investors have been moving around the Ethereum (ETH) space with extreme caution. Ethereum (ETH) investors and analysts anticipate increased volatility in the coin as soon as the Ethereum (ETH) Shanghai update is live.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum (ETH) is sitting at $1,874.08 for one token, a 2.35% decrease in the last 24 hours. In addition, the Ethereum (ETH) market cap is also down by 2.22% over the previous 24 hours, along with the trading volume of Ethereum (ETH), which is down by 14.53%.\n\nSo, at this moment, Ethereum (ETH) investors are decreasing their trades, expecting that prices will continue to go down.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nEnjin Coin (ENJ)\n\nEnjin Coin (ENJ) is facing some mixed feelings from investors at the moment, with some believing that the token will face a bullish market and anticipate increases in the Enjin Coin (ENJ) prices. On the other hand, other Enjin Coin (ENJ) investors are predicting a further decrease in the prices and trading volume of the Enjin Coin (ENJ) token.\n\nAt the moment, Enjin Coin (ENJ) is priced at $0.4136 for one ENJ token, a 4.96% decrease in the past 24 hours. Consequently, the Enjin Coin (ENJ) market cap is also experiencing a decrease of 4.62% in the past 24 hours, while the Enjin Coin (ENJ) trading volume is down by 10.42% in the past 24 hours.\n\nLearn out more about the Collateral Network presale here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.collateralnetwork.io/\n\nPresale: https://app.collateralnetwork.io/register\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/collateralnwk\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Collateralnwk\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates'}, {'id': 4, 'time': 'Sun, 16 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Polygon zkEVM: Ethereum's Leading zkRollup Blockchain? - DailyCoin", 'content': 'With the Polygon zkEVM, Polygon (MATIC) is adding another weapon to its arsenal and reinstating its claim as the ultimate Ethereum (ETH) scaling ecosystem. Polygon’s zkEVM network aims to offer users unmatched security and minimal gas fees, outperforming other scaling solutions.\n\nDespite their considerable resources, Polygon Labs isn’t the first crypto team to release a zero-knowledge rollup to boast EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) functionality. In fact, on-chain metrics suggest that the Polygon zkEVM is playing catch-up, falling behind other players in the Layer-2 Race.\n\nIs the Polygon zkEVM truly the future of Ethereum scalability? How is the new network different from the existing Polygon PoS network?\n\nWhat Is Polygon zkEVM?\n\nPolygon zkEVM is a Layer-2 network that combines two powerful technologies to boost blockchain scalability and security. Using zero-knowledge proofs and industry-standard Ethereum Virtual Machine, the Polygon zkEVM is touted as ‘the next big thing.’\n\nSource: Twitter\n\nThe network was brought to life in March 2023 when Vitalik Buterin signed the first transaction on the new blockchain. Inspired by Neil Armstrong, the Ethereum co-founder etched “A few million constraints for man, unconstrained scalability for mankind” into the Polygon zkEVM mainnet forever.\n\nHow Does Polygon zkEVM Work?\n\nTo better understand how Polygon’s shiny new blockchain works, let’s briefly break down its two key features.\n\nZero-knowledge validity proofs are a creative way to show someone you know sensitive information without actually revealing the content of the information itself. This provides users greater security and privacy while taking advantage of a more scalable network.\n\nSource: Polygon Labs\n\nIn the case of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, zkRollups enable a network to batch up groups and transactions and prove they’re valid without revealing what the transactions actually are. These transactions are sent back to the Ethereum blockchain, where they’re settled using the network’s famed security.\n\nIn its most basic terms, the Ethereum Virtual Machine is essentially the operating system of the Ethereum mainnet. It allows users to write smart contracts and deploy dApps and services on-chain. By running an EVM blockchains can host Ethereum-based applications. This helps users and developers interact with the network in a familiar environment.\n\nCombining these features, the Polygon zkEVM gives users the best of both worlds. They enjoy the scalability of a Layer-2 network and EVM-equivalence, with the privacy and security of Ethereum zkr ollup technology.\n\nPolygon zkEVM vs. Polygon PoS Mainnet\n\nWhile both networks aim to scale Ethereum, their methods are slightly different.\n\nPolygon PoS is a sidechain that is EVM-compatible. It runs parallel to the Ethereum mainnet and is secured by a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. Gas fees on the network are paid in MATIC, the native token of the Polygon ecosystem.\n\nPolygon zkEVM is a network built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. It uses zero-knowledge architecture to speed up processing times while benefitting from the security of Ethereum’s consensus. Gas fees are paid in ETH, not MATIC.\n\nInstead of being EVM-compatible, the network aims to be EVM-equivalent. Let me explain what this means.\n\nAccording to Polygon Labs, the ultimate goal is not EVM compatibility. Compatible means that the network can operate within the confines of Ethereum’s broader ecosystem. Existing dApps and developer toolsets can still be ported over but might require slight code changes to avoid bugs.\n\nEVM equivalence suggests that Polygon zkEVM offers users an identical environment and experience while benefitting from improved scalability. Polygon Labs argues that the best way to scale Ethereum is to become its equal rather than simply operating within its limits.\n\nPolygon zkEVM Competitors\n\nFor all its hype and excitement, Polygon is not the only crypto project exploring zkEVM networks. ZkSync actually beat Polygon Labs to market and released their mainnet a few days before the Polygon zkEVM went live.\n\nOn-chain metrics indicate that zkSync is by far the more popular network. Within two weeks of the launch of both blockchains, zkSync has attracted $72M in TVL (Total Value Locked). In contrast, the Polygon zkEVM has only accrued $1M in TVL.\n\nSource: DeFiLlama\n\nSource: DeFiLlama\n\nIn that wasn’t enough, almost ten times more users have bridged over to zkSync compared to Polygon zkEVM. While zkSync is home to over 300,000 unique wallet addresses, the Polygon zkEVM mainnet beta is lagging behind with only 32,000 unique wallets.\n\nThough this could be considered a grim indicator for Polygon Labs, this staggering difference might be due to speculation around a possible zkSync token airdrop. Airdrop eligibility is often given to early supporters who bridge to new chains and provide liquidity in DeFi applications.\n\nIn any case, both zkRollups pale compared to other Ethereum scaling solutions...'}]

Developers can link their blockchain project to Ganache once the workspace has been built, enabling them to test and debug their application on the simulated blockchain network.\n\nGanache provides a range of useful features, including the creation of new accounts, the ability to send transactions and the capability to debug smart contracts. By effectively locating and fixing bugs in their smart contract code, developers can use Ganache as a debugging tool to speed up the development process. The debugger feature allows developers to comb through their code line-by-line and see the values of variables at each step, making it easier to find and fix bugs.\n\nTwo versions of Ganache are available: a user interface (UI) and a command line interface (CLI). Thanks to the user-friendly Ganache UI, developers can quickly communicate with the local blockchain. In addition to offering real-time data on accounts, balances, transactions and events, it also has tools for testing and debugging smart contracts. In addition, the interface includes a built-in block explorer tool that lets users examine the specifics of each block and transaction.\n\nOn the other hand, developers can communicate with the local blockchain via the terminal using the Ganache CLI. It is a more versatile and compact choice for people who prefer using command-line tools. Developers may automate testing and deployment operations by integrating the CLI with other development tools and scripts.\n\nRegardless, the essential functionality of the Ganache UI and CLI is the same, and developers can choose the version that best suits their tastes and workflow.\n\nIs Ganache blockchain free?\n\nYes, Ganache is a free, open-source blockchain development tool. The personal blockchain network can be launched and managed using Ganache’s user-friendly interface. To make it simple for developers to test their smart contracts in a secure environment, it also produces private keys for the accounts generated in the network.\n\nRelated: The importance of open-source in computer science and software development\n\nIn the Ethereum development community, Ganache is a popular tool for creating, evaluating and deploying smart contracts. It is ideal for developers to incorporate it into their workflows because it is interoperable with other Ethereum development tools like the Truffle Suite framework. Truffle Suite is an Ethereum development framework for building, testing and deploying smart contracts on the blockchain.\n\nAre Truffle and Ganache the same blockchain?\n\nTruffle and Ganache are not the same blockchains, but they are closely related tools used in blockchain development. Truffle can be used with various blockchain networks, but as a local development network, it is most often used with Ganache.\n\nBefore releasing their smart contracts to a live network, developers can use Truffle to design, compile and test them on the Ganache network. This makes it possible to design and test software fast and affordably, and iterate on and modify the code of smart contracts.\n\nHow to install and use Ganache\n\nGanache is an essential tool for blockchain developers, as it allows them to test and debug their applications on a simulated blockchain network before deploying them on a live network. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to install and use Ganache for personal Ethereum blockchain development:\n\nStep 1: Download and install Ganache\n\nDownload the application for your operating system from the official Ganache website. Run the installation file after downloading it, then install the application on your computer by adhering to the on-screen prompts. Ganache is available for Windows, Mac and Linux operating systems in all its versions.\n\nStep 2: Create a new workspace\n\nTo create a new workspace, open the Ganache application and select “New Workspace.” Users can set up the netwo...'}]

REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, we see a bullish trend in the ETH market with consistent increases in open price, total value transferred, number of unique addresses, successful transactions, and total transactions. However, the MACD signal remains at sell, indicating a short-term bearish outlook. The news analyst report further supports a bullish trend, citing the positive impact of the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade and increased investor confidence in the cryptocurrency market.

The Shanghai upgrade primarily impacted Ethereum\'s (ETH) Execution Layer, while Capella targeted the Consensus Layer. The implementation dubbed "Shapella," is expected to enhance the network\'s performance, security, and efficiency.The upgrade allowed users to withdraw billions of dollars in Ether, the native token of the Ethereum network, and the network recorded a hefty inflow of deposits, touching a yearly high of $2,129.Staking in crypto involves holding and locking up a certain amount of cryptocurrency to participate in the network and earn returns akin to a traditional bank FD.Investors were fearing that Ether holders would quickly withdraw their staked tokens, but fresh deposits helped sustain the staking balance for a couple of days. But lately, withdrawals from Ethereum staking contracts have exceeded deposits.Indian investors said that Ethereum holders now have more confidence to stake their tokens after the Shanghai upgrade as it will allow them to unstake their ETH after a 14-day lock-in period from that day."Unlike other Smart Contract Blockchains, the percentage of staked tokens is only 15% in Ethereum, which is expected to rise from here on. Cardano has 69% of ADA tokens staked, Avalanche has 54% AVAX staked, Solana has 71% of SOL staked," said Ashwini Nadar, a Mumbai-based software professional and avid crypto enthusiast.Ethereum, a decentralized blockchain platform founded by Vitalik Buterin in 2015, allows developers to create decentralised applications (dApps) and smart contracts. It ranks as the second-largest cryptocurrency platform by market capitalisation, following Bitcoin.Ethereum upgrades, often called "hard forks" or "network upgrades," entail modifications to the Ethereum protocol or the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which operates smart contracts.At CoinDCX, Ethereum gained more than 6% a day after the upgrade.The exchange said that its on-chain data showed that there was a significant increase of nearly 100,000 ETH tokens staked on the Ethereum blockchain on April 14, marking the largest one-day increase in almost two months."This suggests that rather than withdrawing staked ETH to cash out, a significant portion of investors view the successful Shapella upgrade as an indication to stake their Ether tokens," said Thukral of CoinDCX.The upgrade sets the stage for a transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, replacing the existing proof-of-work (PoW) system.'}]

Therefore, I would make a trading action of 0.5, reflecting moderate confidence in the potential price increases in the future while still managing risks appropriately.

*** ONCHAIN ANALYST RESPONSE ***
The recent data shows a consistent decrease in the open price of ETH, along with a fluctuating average gas price and total value transferred. The number of unique addresses, successful transactions, and total transactions have also been varying. Despite the fluctuations, the total gas used has remained relatively stable. The MACD signal consistently indicates a sell trend. Based on this information, it can be inferred that the market trend for ETH is currently bearish, with a potential for further decline in price. Investors may consider exercising caution and closely monitoring the market for any potential changes in trend.

And so far, 96% of withdrawal volume has been from users withdrawing their rewards instead of their entire stakes, according to researcher Flipside Crypto.\n\nEther jumped as much as 6% to $2,023 on Thursday, taking it to levels not seen since May 2022. Its 68% year-to-date gain still trails Bitcoin’s 84% gain. But there could be some additional upside if the size of withdrawals in the queue — now two weeks long, according to Rated Network Explorer — remains muted.\n\n“This could still be volatile,” said Noelle Acheson, author of the “Crypto Is Macro Now” newsletter. “There is a queue forming for ETH withdrawals, and the looming sell pressure from Kraken, Celsius and others — that have to un-stake” but the “overall liquidity situation is favorable for crypto assets.”\n\nCrypto exchange Kraken, which is discontinuing staking products in the US as part of a settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, dominated the initial exit queue, based on figures compiled by Rated.\n\nBut overall, the amount of Ether entering the market from Shanghai withdrawals is much lower than what was previously expected, said Grayscale Research analyst Matt Maximo. “The amount of new ETH being staked is also outpacing the withdrawals, which is creating added buy pressure to offset the withdrawn ETH.”\n\nStory continues\n\nAbout 1.2 million of Ether tokens — worth approximately $2.3 billion at current prices — was expected to be withdrawn over the next five days, according to researcher Coin Metrics. However, that represents just 6% of the roughly $36.7 billion of Ether locked up for staking, data from Staking Rewards shows.\n\nInvestors had been braced for crypto price swings around the upgrade, but so far digital-asset markets have been largely steady.\n\nSmaller coins from applications that try to make it easier to harness Ether staking rewards, such as Lido and Rocket Pool, advanced, according to CoinGecko data. LDO climbed 7.2% and RPL was up 11%, the data showed.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain in September last year transitioned to a proof-of-stake from a proof-of-work approach, a revamp called the Merge that slashed the network’s electricity consumption.\n\nProof-of-stake uses piles of Ether — placed in special so-called staking wallets — to help order transactions on the Ethereum network. And with investors now able to withdraw staked funds — boosting the appeal of an Ether investment — a debate is stirring over whether Ethereum could someday replace Bitcoin as the world’s largest digital currency.\n\n“Ethereum is updating and navigating with great skill — so far anyway — and cementing its position as the No. 2 crypto,” said Aaron Brown, a crypto investor who writes for Bloomberg Opinion. The network is “moving to the future much faster than Bitcoin.”\n\n--With assistance from Sidhartha Shukla and Carly Wanna.\n\n(Updates price reactions and adds commentary in fourth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n©2023 Bloomberg L.P.'}]

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
The news articles highlight the successful completion of a key software upgrade on the Ethereum network, leading to a rally in Ether's price above $2,000. The upgrade allows users to withdraw staked Ether coins, with a majority choosing to withdraw rewards rather than their entire stakes. Despite initial concerns of rapid outflows, the amount of Ether entering the market from withdrawals is lower than expected, creating added buy pressure and supporting the overall liquidity situation for crypto assets. This positive development for Ethereum, coupled with the ongoing interest in DeFi, could potentially contribute to a bullish market trend for Ether and other cryptocurrencies in the near term.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing a bearish trend, with sell signals in the MACD indicator and fluctuating open prices. The total value transferred has increased, but the overall market sentiment seems to be on the decline. 

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights significant activity in the Ethereum market, with promising investments in ETH and other related projects. The market is evolving, with potential for growth but also concerns regarding privacy and competition in the scaling space.

In reflection, it is evident that a conservative and risk-averse approach has been effective in navigating the uncertainty in the ETH market. Prioritizing risk management and focusing on long-term strategies have led to successful outcomes.

Considering the mixed signals from the on-chain and news analyst reports, it is important to take a slightly conservative trading approach to mitigate risks and position for long-term success. Therefore, I would recommend a cautious trading action of 0.3, reflecting a moderate level of confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.
ACTION:
0.3
DAILY RETURN:
-0.01625450775872772
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently bearish, with indications of further price declines in the near future. The sell signals in the MACD indicator and fluctuations in key metrics such as the average gas price and total value transferred suggest a lack of positive momentum in the market.

On the other hand, the news analyst report presents a mixed sentiment for ETH, with potential sell pressure in the short term due to the influx of ETH at exchanges but long-term growth potential as Ethereum aims to surpass Bitcoin in market dominance. The use of tools like Ganache for blockchain project development also highlights the importance of testing and debugging applications, which could contribute to the long-term success of Ethereum.

Reflecting on the recent trading performance and considering the mixed signals in the market, it is advisable to adopt a slightly conservative trading approach. By prioritizing risk management, closely monitoring key trends, and focusing on long-term strategies, traders can navigate the volatility in the cryptocurrency market effectively.

Therefore, based on the synthesized reports and the emphasis on long-term strategies over short-term gains, I would recommend taking a conservative approach and holding onto ETH for potential long-term growth. My trading action would be to buy ETH with a confidence level of 0.5, indicating a neutral stance with a slight inclination towards a positive market trend in the long term.

The news analyst report provides a more bullish outlook, indicating that the recent Shapella upgrade has increased confidence among stakers and led to a surge in transaction volumes, pointing towards a positive market trend for ETH in the near future.

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a slightly conservative and risk-averse trading approach has been effective in navigating the uncertainty in the ETH market.

The company's institutional staking solutions, including white label nodes and slashing insurance, have been used to stake more than $1.3 billion worth of assets, according to a press release. It plans to use the newly raised funds to expand its portfolio to include more chains in the Ethereum space, including Celestia, Sui, and Aleo.\n\nP2P.org also plans to expand its business model, focusing on building a stronger community, enhancing consumer support, improving customer experience, and elevating current infrastructure, according to a press release.\n\nEthereum Soars to 11-Month High Following Shanghai Upgrade\n\nP2P.org credits the successful round of funding to the recent Shanghai Upgrade, which it hopes will increase institutional interest in staking Ethereum. Institutional interest in staking on Ethereum has historically been lower compared to other blockchains, according to Konstantin Lomashuk, founder of P2P.org. But the upgrade has already resulted in increased staking of Ethereum across the board.\n\nThough Ethereum is seeing more inflows, digital assets firm CoinShares reported institutional investors are still prioritizing investments in Bitcoin. More than $104 million was reported in Bitcoin inflows as of Monday. As of Thursday morning, Bitcoin is trading for $28,650.40, down 2% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko.\n\nBitcoin Fund Inflows Top $100M in One Week as Investors 'Flee to Safety'\n\n“We are pleased to announce this fundraising round with our strategic investors,” Lomashuk said. “Now that the upgrade is complete and as the market continues to expand, we may expect ETH staking to grow significantly in market size.”\n\nSaurabh Sharma, Head of Investments at Jump Crypto, is optimistic about the opportunity. “We are excited to participate in this funding round and continue to leverage their cross-chain expertise,” Sharma said.\n\nStory continues\n\nBill Xing, Head of Financial Product of Bybit, said in the release that he thinks the P2P.org will enhance the mission of Web3, with the ultimate goal of putting control of the economy into people’s hands.\n\n“The third iteration of the internet was born with the promise of decentralization and democratization of finance,” he said. “We are proud to associate the Bybit name with P2P.org, the most trusted validator and infrastructure provider in the space. We look forward to elevating the space for believers in the digital economy together.”\n\nEthereum, at the time of writing, is trading at $1,841.33, down 2% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko.

These solutions are marketed as a way to make Ethereum faster, cheaper and more scalable.\n\nBut if you look at what is actually being built and why, you will see that the generally accepted L2 narrative isn’t telling the whole story. What layer-2 technology is actually doing is putting a Band-Aid over some specific issues on Ethereum — but not actually creating solutions that will solve any of Ethereum’s real problems.\n\nIf there’s one belief at the core of crypto, it’s that incentives matter; the motivations, often financial or reputational, that drive individuals or entities to promote or criticize a certain narrative.\n\nWhat are the incentives motivating the people behind L2s?\n\nThey stand to benefit from L2s being perceived as a feature rather than a bug.\n\nIf layer-2s were widely understood to be a Band-Aid, rather than a fix, this would negatively impact anyone even tangentially involved in the Ethereum space — and certainly anyone behind these solutions, or anyone who intends to leverage these solutions.\n\nA shift in perception that identifies L2s as an insufficient stopgap measure would likely encourage the community to prioritize finding and developing long-term solutions to Ethereum’s challenges, potentially leading to the emergence of more innovative and sustainable technologies.\n\nWhat Ethereum is doing wrong\n\nThe main problem with Ethereum is that it can be simply too expensive for people to use. Vitalik Buterin has freely admitted this.\n\nWe can actually keep this discussion fairly non-technical. L2s are a solution to a PROBLEM. Something is wrong with Ethereum, and that needs to be fixed. That’s just reality and it is FINE.\n\nThe reason why it is too expensive to use Ethereum is because the network charges gas (essentially, ETH) to use its resources. The more people use the network’s resources, the scarcer those resources become and the higher the cost of those resources in ETH. Of course, the price of ETH can go up as this happens, which obviously creates certain financial incentives. Simply put, high usage and high ETH fees benefit people who already hold ETH.\n\nThe problem then with Ethereum is less about the fact that gas fees exist, but instead that gas fees are TOO high. They’re so high that they are limiting the upside for the people who control the chain.\n\nIf gas fees are high because of limited network resources, then the solution is obvious; Increase network resources. L2s accomplish this by giving users a place to send their transactions instead of the main network (main net) where they can be processed. The results of those transactions can then be broadcast down into the main network, Ethereum.\n\nSimply put — L2s are a way of NOT using Ethereum. Why, then, is the L2 narrative one of the successful solving of Ethereum’s problems, rather than a critical look at this solution’s temporary nature?\n\nThe dominant approach in the crypto space has been to avoid speaking honestly about both the benefits and the limitations of the technologies we are developing.\n\nInstead, we act as though our existing solutions are perfect. Even though we can acknowledge when they need small improvements, it’s normal to see anyone who says anything more intensely critical as an enemy, someone uninformed who doesn’t know what they are talking about, someone just trying to pump their own bag.\n\nIncentives matter\n\nWhenever you see a very one-sided narrative being put forward, especially when there is a lot of money on the line, this is an indication that something isn’t right. There’s almost always two sides to every story, especially when that story is about a solution to a problem. It’s crucial to approach such narratives with a discerning eye and critically evaluate the motivations behind each side of any argument to develop a well-rounded understanding of the issue at hand.\n\nIn the context of Ethereum and layer-2 solutions, it’s important to keep in mind that different parties have their own incentives to either promote or criticize these technologies.\n\nOn the one hand, there are those who have a vested interest in promoting layer-2s as the ultimate solution to Ethereum’s scalability issues; these individuals are likely to be Ethereum proponents or developers involved in creating and maintaining L2 projects. On the other hand, there are those who stand to gain from criticizing Ethereum and its scaling solutions, such as competitors in the blockchain space or individuals who have invested in rival platforms.\n\nIf L2 solutions were seen as temporary workarounds rather than real solutions, users, developers, and investors might become less inclined to participate in or support layer-2 projects.\n\nAnd while this would obviously hinder the growth and development of L2s, this lack of confidence in the real L2 narrative could actually prompt individuals to seek out alternative solutions, including new blockchain platforms, that of...'}, {'id': 5, 'time': 'Thu, 20 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Here's how Ethereum's ZK-rollups can become interoperable - Cointelegraph", 'content': 'The past few weeks have seen a wave of zero-knowledge proof project launches, including Polygon’s zkEVM and Matter Lab’s zkSync Era on mainnet, and the Linea zkEVM from ConsenSys on testnet.\n\nThey join StarkWare’s long-running StarkEx solution and its decentralized cousin StarkNet along with a variety of other projects in development from Polygon (Miden, Zero, etc.) and Scroll.\n\nThey all promise faster and cheaper transactions to scale Ethereum using zero-knowledge proofs.\n\nBut is the brutal competition between ZK-rollups a zero-sum game where there can be only one winner? Or are we looking at a future in which lots of different rollups are able to work in harmony and interoperably?\n\nAnthony Rose, head of engineering for zkSync, thinks the latter future is much more likely and predicts that one day, no one will think about which ZK-rollup they are on because it’ll all just be infrastructure.\n\n“I think that if we don’t get to that world, then we’ve probably failed,” he says. “It’s the same way as somebody using Snapchat or Facebook doesn’t really have to know about TCP/IP or HTTP — it’s just the plumbing of the way the internet works.”\n\nBut how do we move from a bunch of competing sovereign rollups to an ecosystem of ZK solutions that are interoperable and composable?\n\nPeople are already starting to think about this question, and all of the ZK projects Magazine spoke to have plans to make their projects interoperable with at least some other rollups — although the extent to which that can happen likely depends on the development of standards and protocols.\n\nAlso read: Attack of the zkEVMs! Crypto’s 10x moment\n\nZero knowledge about ZK-rollups?\n\nIf you’re unfamiliar with the term “zero-knowledge proofs” — which StarkWare insists should be called “validity proofs” — they’re a way to scale Ethereum using cryptography. Rollups take the computation for tens of thousands of transactions off the main blockchain and write a tiny cryptographic proof back to Ethereum that proves the computation was carried out correctly.\n\n“Every proof we generate covers roughly 20,000 transactions and fits inside a single block of Ethereum,” explains StarkWare co-founder Eli Ben-Sasson.\n\nDespite this increase in transactions per block, zkSync’s Rose doesn’t think Ethereum can come close to scaling up to become the base layer for everything via a single rollup.\n\n“A ZK-rollup on its own will not scale to the world that we’re talking about,” Rose says. “If we think that applications with some interactions on the blockchain are providing value to hundreds of millions of people, the scalability problem is still there to be solved.”\n\nScaling is a little like internet bandwidth, in that the more you get, the more you realize you need. Back in 2017, Ethereum planned to scale using “Eth2” sharding. This roadmap was then ripped up after ZK-rollups emerged in 2018 and promised vastly greater scaling, but only if Ethereum upgraded the blockchain with a different form of sharding (proto danksharding and then danksharding) to enable the ZK-rollups to achieve higher throughput.\n\nEven then, Rose says it’s likely rollups will need to work in collaboration. “This is a big active area of research for us,” Rose says of interoperability. “As the systems mature as well… I think, naturally, this is kind of the pattern that these systems suggest.”\n\nEthereum scaling is some way off\n\nIt’s the early days yet for scaling, however. Although various solutions claim they can theoretically hit tens of thousands of transactions per second (or even talk about “unlimited” scaling), in practice, they’re hamstrung by data availability on Ethereum.\n\nAt present, between them, the various Ethereum scaling solutions and Ethereum are running at about 25 transactions per second (TPS). Ethereum itself has performed an average of about 12 TPS over the past month, Arbitrum One was at 7.2 TPS, Optimism at 2.65 TPS and zkSync at 1.6 TPS, according to ETHTPS.info.\n\nThese numbers move around a bit and are low mostly due to demand rather than capacity. StarkEx is not covered, but StarkWare tells Magazine it averaged 5 TPS over the past month.\n\nDespite supply outweighing demand so far, interoperability between rollups would already be helpful to ensure that users don’t get stuck in walled gardens. Optimistic Rollup users, for example, have to wait a week to withdraw funds, which rather limits interoperability.\n\nZK-rollups don’t have that limitation and can allow instant withdrawals (but don’t).\n\nAlso read: ZK-rollups are ‘the endgame’ for scaling blockchains: Polygon Miden founder\n\nInteroperable ZK-rollups are possible, but is it probable?\n\nBobbin Threadbare, founder of Polygon Miden, says interoperability between ZK-rollups is certainly technically possible, but “whether it will happen in practice is a different question.”\n\nHe explains that withdrawals aren’t instant yet because it’s not financially viable to put proofs on Ethereum that frequently, so transactions are fired off roughly...'}]

The exodus of tokens following the event slowed down.\n\nWithin a week, the amount of staked ether trumped the number of ETH being withdrawn for the very first time.'}, {'id': 24, 'time': 'Fri, 21 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Expert predicts major pullback for Bitcoin and Ethereum as US recession looms - Finbold - Finance in Bold', 'content': 'Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) could be facing resistance at key round number levels of $30,000 and $2,000, with the potential for a stock market downturn with the Federal Reserve tightening into a recession that could affect all risk assets.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum have had a pivotal status since 2020, with definable diminishing supply and low but increasing adoption making a strong case for long-term bullishness.\n\nOn April 21, Bloomberg senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone stated that the yield curve’s highest probability since 1982 suggests a growing consensus that the worst of a US recession may be over. However, this could potentially lead to large pullback risks, according to McGlone.\n\nMcGlone tweeted: “Bitcoin and Ethereum — may be running into a wall of resistance at the key round number levels of $30,000 and $2,000. Our bias is bullish in the long term for the top cryptos, but an overwhelming force of the stock market going down with the Fed tightening into a recession has the potential to lower the tide for all risk assets, and Bitcoin and Ethereum are among the riskiest.”\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are among high-risk assets. Source: Mike McGlone\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum\n\nThe future of Bitcoin and Ethereum is closely tied to technological advancements and increasing adoption. Many experts believe that these cryptocurrencies will continue to gain mainstream acceptance as more businesses and individuals recognize the benefits of decentralized financial systems.\n\nSince the turn of the year, Bitcoin has experienced a notable increase of approximately 70%, while Ethereum has climbed just above 60%. Interestingly, a recent historical pattern has emerged as the value of Bitcoin has again reached 15 ETH after six years.\n\nDespite the impressive performance of these digital assets and surpassing key price levels of $30,000 and $2,000 in April, both have experienced significant pullbacks in the last week. At present, Bitcoin is trading at $28,077, down 1.88% on the day and 8.91% over the previous week. Meanwhile, Ethereum, the second-largest asset by market cap, is currently trading at $1,908, down 1.75% in the last 24 hours and 9.86% in the last week.\n\nWhile Bitcoin and Ethereum’s recent pullbacks may cause temporary concern, their overall upward trend and potential for long-term growth remain.

The recent Ethereum upgrades, including the Shanghai upgrade and the transition to proof-of-stake through the Merge, have had a significant impact on the ETH market. The unlocking of staked tokens led to a price rally to $2,100, but subsequent market declines have seen ETH drop below $1,900. Additionally, the expiration of a large number of ETH options, along with speculation surrounding Vitalik Buterin's personal life, have added to market uncertainty. Despite potential resistance levels at $2,000 and broader market risks, such as a potential US recession, the long-term bullish case for Ethereum remains strong due to technological advancements and increasing adoption. Investors should remain cautious of short-term fluctuations and monitor market conditions closely.

The data shows a consistent decrease in the open price of ETH, along with fluctuating metrics such as average gas price and total value transferred. The MACD signal also consistently indicates a sell trend, suggesting caution for investors.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights positive developments for Ethereum, such as the successful software upgrade and the lower-than-expected outflows from withdrawals. This could potentially contribute to a bullish market trend for Ether and other cryptocurrencies in the near term.

In reflecting on the reports, it is clear that a slightly conservative and risk-averse approach has been effective in navigating the uncertainty in the ETH market.

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain, news, and reflection analyst reports, it is clear that the overall sentiment towards ETH is bearish in the short term due to the downward trend in prices, increasing gas prices, and challenges in breaking key resistance levels. However, there is a potential for a short-term reversal indicated by the recent MACD signal change. The focus on long-term strategies, risk management, and monitoring key trends such as transaction volumes and software upgrades is emphasized in the reflection report.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is advisable to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains in the current volatile market environment.

Three altcoins to watch this coming season are Dogetti (DETI), Ethereum (ETH), and Dogecoin (DOGE), which all look to make incredible gains.\n\nDogetti off to a Brilliant Start\n\nDogetti (DETI) is a newcomer to the market, which is currently in its presale stage, showing promising gains as more and more investors are purchasing tokens while it is still at a low price. DETI offers a unique blend of a cryptocurrency that pledges to donate to user-chosen charities whilst redistributing a percentage of each transaction amongst its token holders. Operating on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain, DETI will be due to benefit from ETH’s recent gains and after the presale ends on the 20th of June, DETI will be set onto a successful blockchain with exciting prospects. DETI uses a proof of stake mechanism, which will increase demand for the coin and protect it against any restrictions that may come into place against the proof of work mining system.\n\nEthereum Accelerating with the Shanghai Upgrade\n\nEthereum (ETH) has permanently moved to a proof of stake system from proof of work, with its recent much-hyped Shanghai upgrade. Following this upgrade, ETH saw a spike in price as interest caused the value to rise above the $2k threshold, and as Bitcoin (BTC) looks to enter a decline many suspect that ETH could take its place. ETH has long been BTC’s biggest competitor but has yet to reach the dizzying heights that BTC has done in the past. This, however, could all change if we enter an alt season as we are predicted to do, and the reign of BTC could be brought to a dramatic end.\n\nDogecoin Turning Heads\n\nThe final altcoin that offers a tempting alternative to the mainstream crypto of Bitcoin (BTC) is Dogecoin (DOGE). DOGE has seen admirable gains over the past month, and looks to continue its rise, in what one trader, CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto) has predicted could be “the mother of all alt seasons”. DOGE currently operates on its own blockchain under a proof of work system, and while we have been seeing the rise of proof of stake, DOGE’s similarity in this sense to BTC could be an advantage to the coin nearing the top of the market. DOGE may have begun as a joke, but it seems to have succeeded in its aims to threaten the concept of an ever-serious approach to crypto by its predecessors.\n\nAs 2023’s altcoin season rapidly approaches, investors are gearing up to find the currencies on the market, or due to be released imminently, that have the potential for the biggest rewards. Dogetti (DETI), Ethereum (ETH), and Dogecoin (DOGE) are three such coins, and as they gain traction and receive more attention, they stand to become some of the biggest players this season.\n\nDogetti (DETI)\n\nPresale: https://dogetti.io/how-to-buy\n\nWebsite: https://dogetti.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/Dogetti\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_Dogetti_\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates'}, {'id': 29, 'time': 'Sat, 22 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'SafeMoon hacker agrees to return 80% of stolen funds: Finance Redefined - Cointelegraph', 'content': 'Welcome to Finance Redefined, your weekly dose of essential decentralized finance (DeFi) insights — a newsletter crafted to bring you the most significant developments from the past week.\n\nThis week in DeFi saw the hacker behind the $8.9 million SafeMoon exploit agree to return the majority of the stolen funds.

While these two cryptocurrencies have been around for some time and have seen significant growth, they may not be the best investment options for those looking to make a quick profit. However, a new type of cryptocurrency known as AI crypto is rapidly gaining attention as a potentially lucrative investment opportunity. In this article, I will explore the world of cryptocurrency, examine Bitcoin and Ethereum, and discuss the potential of AI crypto investment.\n\nIntroduction to Cryptocurrency\n\nCryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security. It operates independently of a central bank and can be used to buy goods and services or traded for other currencies. The first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, was created in 2009 by an unknown person or group under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Since then, thousands of other cryptocurrencies have emerged, including Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ripple.\n\nUnderstanding Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are two of the most well-known cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is the first and most popular cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization of over $1 trillion. It is a decentralized currency that operates on a peer-to-peer network and is created through a process called mining. Ethereum, on the other hand, is a decentralized platform that enables the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps) through its native cryptocurrency, Ether.\n\nWhile both Bitcoin and Ethereum have seen significant growth over the years, they may not be the best investment options for those looking to make a quick profit. The volatility of the cryptocurrency market means that prices can fluctuate wildly in a short amount of time, making it a risky investment for those without a high tolerance for risk.\n\nIs Bitcoin a Good Investment?\n\nBitcoin has been around for over a decade and has seen significant growth in its value. However, whether or not it is a good investment depends on a variety of factors. While some investors believe that Bitcoin is a safe investment due to its limited supply and increasing demand, others argue that it is too volatile and risky.\n\nOne of the main drawbacks of investing in Bitcoin is its volatility. The value of Bitcoin can fluctuate wildly in a short amount of time, making it difficult to predict its future value. Additionally, Bitcoin is not backed by any government or financial institution, which means that it is not subject to the same regulations and protections as traditional investments.\n\nHow to Mine Ethereum\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, Ethereum cannot be mined using traditional mining methods. Instead, it uses a process called proof-of-stake (PoS) to create new Ether tokens. PoS is a more energy-efficient and cost-effective method of creating new tokens compared to proof-of-work (PoW), which is used by Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nTo mine Ethereum, you need to join a mining pool or set up your own mining rig. A mining pool is a group of miners who combine their computing power to increase their chances of earning Ether. Setting up your own mining rig can be expensive and time-consuming, but it gives you more control over the mining process.\n\nWhat is AI Crypto?\n\nSome AI crypto uses algorithms to analyze market data and make predictions about future market trends. Avorak AI is one of these projects. They allow investors to make more informed decisions about when to buy and sell their investments. Additionally, AI crypto is designed to be more resistant to market manipulation and fraud, making it a potentially safer investment option.\n\nInvesting in AI Crypto\n\nAvorak provides heavy incentives for holding AVRK. The revenue model, which gives 49% of all revenue back to holders, creates a truly passive income. Unlike the ‘passive income’ tokens of the past couple of years that simply minted the token into the ground pretending to be yield, the revenue comes from the product itself, meaning there is no inflation to the token.\n\nConclusion: The Future of Cryptocurrency\n\nCryptocurrency is still a relatively new and rapidly evolving technology. While Bitcoin and Ethereum have seen significant growth over the years, they may not be the best investment options for those looking to make a quick profit. However, AI crypto is rapidly gaining attention as a potentially lucrative investment opportunity.\n\nInvesting in AI crypto could bring the kind of gains buying early into Bitcoin and Ethereum gave. Avorak bringing new technologies to blockchain makes it a prime target for investors, and they are raising capital fast. Getting in before the launch will guarantee lower prices and help investors on the ladder to be ready for the climb to the top.\n\nWant to learn more about Avorak AI?\n\n\n\nWebsite: https://avorak.ai\n\nBuy AVRK: https://invest.avorak.ai/register\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Te...'}]

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the market trend for ETH is currently bearish, with a potential for further decline in price. The data shows a consistent decrease in the open price of ETH, along with fluctuating metrics such as average gas price and total value transferred. The MACD signal also consistently indicates a sell trend, suggesting caution for investors.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights positive developments for Ethereum, such as the successful software upgrade and the lower-than-expected outflows from withdrawals. This could potentially contribute to a bullish market trend for Ether and other cryptocurrencies in the near term.

In reflecting on the reports, it is clear that a slightly conservative and risk-averse approach has been effective in navigating the uncertainty in the ETH market. By prioritizing risk management, focusing on long-term strategies, and synthesizing on-chain and news analyst reports, successful outcomes have been achieved.

Considering the bearish on-chain data and the potentially bullish news developments, it is important to take a balanced approach. While short-term gains may be tempting, a focus on long-term strategies is crucial for sustained success in the volatile cryptocurrency market. Therefore, I would take a slightly conservative approach and assign a trading action of 0.3, reflecting moderate confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.
ACTION:
0.3
DAILY RETURN:
0.0034386662076255625
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain, news, and reflection analyst reports, it is clear that the overall sentiment towards ETH is bearish in the short term due to the downward trend in prices, increasing gas prices, and challenges in breaking key resistance levels. However, there is a potential for a short-term reversal indicated by the recent MACD signal change. The focus on long-term strategies, risk management, and monitoring key trends such as transaction volumes and software upgrades is emphasized in the reflection report.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is advisable to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains in the current volatile market environment. While there may be potential for a short-term reversal, it is important to maintain a slightly conservative and risk-averse approach to mitigate risks and position for long-term success.

Therefore, my trading action would be to buy ETH with a confidence level of 0.3, indicating a cautious approach while recognizing the potential for a short-term reversal in the market trend. By balancing short-term gains with long-term strategies and closely monitoring market developments, I aim to navigate the uncertainty in the ETH market effectively and maximize overall profit in the long run.
ACTION:
0.3
DAILY RETURN:
-0.04692646991498628
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain, news, and reflection analyst reports, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing a bearish trend in the short term due to the downward price movement and fluctuations in gas prices. However, the recent buy signal from the MACD indicator and the long-term bullish case for Ethereum, driven by technological advancements and increasing adoption, suggest a potential reversal in the near future.

Considering the market uncertainty caused by recent upgrades, options expiration, and external factors like a potential US recession, it is crucial to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains. By maintaining a slightly conservative and risk-averse approach, traders can navigate the volatile market environment effectively and position themselves for long-term success.

Therefore, I would take a trading action with a confidence level of 0.5, indicating a neutral stance. This decision reflects the need to balance short-term gains with long-term strategies, manage risks appropriately, and remain cautious in the current market conditions. By staying informed, monitoring key trends, and making strategic decisions, traders can maximize their overall profit potential in the ETH market.

[{'id': 3, 'time': 'Sun, 23 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "If Ether's Status Is Unclear After This Article, It's Clearly A You Problem - Blockworks", 'content': 'Ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, has been the subject of much discussion recently. While its status appeared to be settled by the SEC’s staff some time ago, the recent transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism has apparently given the current SEC Chair, Gary Gensler, an opportunity to re-examine the token.\n\nGensler is adamant that the crypto industry has been given perfect clarity on such matters, and has repeatedly declared that the rules for what constitutes a security are absolutely clear, transparent, and not open to interpretation.\n\nSo, is Ether, or ETH, a security, a commodity, or something else?\n\nLuckily we have gathered together all the experts who’ve clearly answered this thorny question, in Blockworks’ Ultimate Guide to Regulatory Clarity.™\n\nWilliam Hinman, Director of the Division of Corporate Finance at the SEC, June 2018:\n\n“Based on my understanding of the present state of Ether, the Ethereum network and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of Ether are not securities transactions.”\n\nLetitia James, New York Attorney General, March 2023:\n\n“The Tokens [including ETH] are securities because they each involve investments of money into a common enterprise with the expectation of profits due to the managerial efforts of the Tokens’ respective founders, developers, and management teams.”\n\nAlso Letitia James, New York Attorney General, March 2023:\n\n“Under both state and federal authority, ETH, LUNA, and UST are commodities.”\n\nJay Clayton, Chair of the SEC, March 2019 (reinforcing Hinman, above):\n\n“A digital asset may be offered and sold initially as a security because it meets the definition of an investment contract, but that designation may change over time if the digital asset later is offered and sold in such a way that it will no longer meet that definition.”\n\nRostin Behnam, Chair of the CFTC, May 2022:\n\n“I can say for sure Bitcoin, which is the largest of the coins and has always been the largest regardless of the total market cap of the entire digital asset market capitalization, is a commodity. Ether as well. I have argued this before, my predecessors as well said it is a commodity.”\n\nGary Gensler, Chair of the SEC, April 2023 (refusing to answer the actual question):\n\n“Ummm, I… I… it’s… actually all securities are commodities under the Commodity and Exchange Act, it’s that we’re excluded commodities, but I would agree that a security cannot also be an excluded commodity and an included commodity.”\n\nNow it’s time for your multiple choice test. Based on the statements above, select one answer.\n\nEther is not a security Ether is a security Ether is both a security and a commodity Ether was a security, but now it isn’t Ether is a commodity Gary Gensler is making it up as he goes along All of the above\n\nClear enough for you?\n\nThanks to Planet Crypto for this week’s illustration.\n\nA version of this op-ed first appeared in Blockworks’ newsletter: Subscribe below.\n\nDon’t miss the next big story – join our free daily newsletter.'}, {'id': 14, 'time': 'Sun, 23 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Bitcoin and Ethereum Creating a Bull Market for New Projects like Big Eyes Coin - Analytics Insight', 'content': 'After breaking the landmark height of $30,000 earlier in the week, Bitcoin has remained stable and continued to grow, offering a promising prospect of a bull run in the crypto market in the coming weeks.\n\nThis is only further cemented by Ethereum (ETH) breaking $2,000 after their “Shanghai” update yesterday. As many experts are claiming that we are now in a bull market, investors are looking towards alternative investment opportunities still in their infancy to achieve maximum returns, such as Big Eyes Coin (BIG).\n\nBig Eyes, Bigger Possibilities\n\nBig Eyes Coin is rapidly approaching the end of its presale period, which ends on the 3rd of June, and the excitement surrounding the launch is palpable. BIG, having raised an impressive £33.73 million so far, has captured the attention of many crypto enthusiasts, and publications are recognizing it as having the potential to become the world’s next most significant meme coin.\n\nAs many other currencies have been experiencing exciting gains over the past week, it is natural that investors are scouring the market for upcoming projects that have the potential to match the growth that we have seen with currencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). The proof of stake system will enable BIG to offer a sustainable and innovative approach that is in line with future progressions within the crypto market.\n\nEthereum’s Leap of Faith\n\nEthereum (ETH) is another currency that has adopted the proof of stake system with their recent “Shanghai” update, moving entirely away from the controversial proof of work system used by many others, like Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nETH’s update has caused a rift in the market, and this gamble has paid off as ETH is looking to continue climbing as it has risen above the $2,000 point. This clearly suggests that we have well and truly entered a bull market.\n\nThe Influence of Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin (BTC) continues to skyrocket, although it remains a long way off its peak of $69,044. As the entire crypto market often follows the trajectory that BTC takes, this shows other currencies, such as Ethereum (ETH) and Big Eyes Coin (BIG), will follow this rise and grow in value in tandem.\n\nBTC has been adopted by many gigantic institutions such as Tesla, Block, and Coinbase, all buying millions of dollars worth of BTC. This has driven up the price of BTC and continues to grow the influence of crypto in the broader economic market.\n\nAs the crypto market continues to gain momentum during this bull run, investors are both continuing to pay attention to innovations by Ethereum and Bitcoin and consider how this will influence the market for new projects like Big Eyes Coin to launch in the near future.

Thanks to an innovation known as smart contracts, developers could create blockchain-based applications that automatically run and transfer value when certain criteria are met.\n\nInitially, Ethereum was the only smart-contract-capable blockchain, but in recent years this has changed. New blockchains have come into existence that not only offer smart contract functionality, but also a slew of other features hoping to build off of Ethereum.\n\nOne of those blockchains is Solana (SOL -2.87%), a blazingly fast smart contract blockchain that has a considerable user base and is the 10th most valuable cryptocurrency by market cap. Many believe Solana could eventually outdo Ethereum as the premier smart contract blockchain, but those hopes might be greatly inflated.\n\nA looming problem\n\nFirst, let's address the elephant in the room: Solana's multiple outages. Over the past year, Solana has experienced at least six network outages, including the most recent one in February where the blockchain was down for more than 18 hours, disrupting a number of exchanges and apps running on the network.\n\nIn contrast, Ethereum has a proven track record of stability and reliability. Ethereum's network has been operating smoothly for years, even with the increasing demand for decentralized applications and smart contracts.\n\nThe undisputed DeFi champ\n\nAnother key factor to consider when comparing Ethereum and Solana is the total value locked (TVL) metric. TVL is an important measure of the adoption and usage of a blockchain in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi). Since DeFi functionality is one of the primary use cases for both Ethereum and Solana, evaluating TVL can be an easy way to compare the two.\n\nEthereum utterly dominates the decentralized finance (DeFi) market with a TVL of more than $31 billion, compared to Solana's TVL of just over $292 million. That means Ethereum supports 100 times more value in DeFi than Solana. Clearly, the competition isn't even close and demonstrates the greater adoption and usage of Ethereum's network in the DeFi market. From this perspective, Ethereum is a much more attractive investment option for those looking to tap into the growing DeFi niche.\n\nSpeed isn't everything\n\nFans of Solana often say that it has some of the fastest transaction speeds. While this is true, it distorts the purpose of a blockchain. One of the primary reasons blockchain technology is so profound is because it allows users to transfer value in a decentralized and secure fashion. While Solana prioritizes speed, it sacrifices higher levels of decentralization and security found in Ethereum.\n\nAlthough many are quick to point out that Ethereum moves at a snail's pace compared to Solana, they also fail to realize that there is serious progress being made to narrow this gap thanks to new solutions known as Layer 2s.\n\nThrough the use of Layer 2 solutions such as Optimism, Polygon, and Arbitrum, Ethereum is transformed into a lightning-fast network, while also maintaining its decentralized and secure nature. As these solutions continue to be developed and adopted, Ethereum's competitive advantage over Solana will likely become even more apparent.\n\nThe big picture\n\nSo, what does this mean for investors looking to pick between Solana and Ethereum? Although Solana may seem like a tempting option with its impressive speed, the lack of value it supports in DeFi and the sacrifices in decentralization and security make it a riskier investment, especially considering it still remains down more than 90% from its all time high.\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, has a proven track record and a solid foundation in the decentralized finance market. Its market dominance, along with the development of Layer 2 solutions, makes it a safer and more promising investment for those looking for long-term growth."}, {'id': 8, 'time': 'Sun, 23 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Shibarium: Shiba Inu's Blockchain - DailyCoin", 'content': 'The upcoming Shibarium launch marks a critical turning point for Shiba Inu (SHIB). It signifies a long-awaited moment for the SHIB Army, when their beloved cryptocurrency evolves from a canine meme coin into a fully-fledged blockchain.\n\nShibarium promises to be the Shiba Inu community’s home in the Web3 world. It represents the fulfillment of Ryoshi’s vision and solidifies the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Led by Shytoshi Kusama, the Shib Army will finally leave Ethereum (ETH) forever and forge its own destiny with lower fees and newfound scalability.\n\nWhat exactly is Shibarium? What does this historic launch mean for SHIB holders, and what awaits the Shiba Inu community in this brave new world?\n\nWhat Is Shibarium?\n\nShibarium is a Layer-2 solution built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. Since Shiba Inu was first created back in 2020, the growth of its ecosystem has been restricted by Ethereum’s scalability issues.\n\nHigh gas fees and slow network transactions on Ethereum have made dApps like ShibaSwap challenging to use, discouraging crypto newcomers from exploring Shiba Inu’s potential.\n\nWith Shibarium, this is all set to change. By launching its own network, the Shiba Inu community will be able to grow its flourishing ecosystem without being inhibited by Ethereum’s limitations.\n\nThe Shibarium blockchain will be faster and cheaper than Ethereum while still enjoying the base network’s security.\n\nHow Does Shibarium Work?\n\nThe Shibarium blockchain uses a new consensus mechanism called Proof-of-Participation. In a PoP network, validator nodes are selected for verifying transactions and securing the network based on the number of BONE tokens they hold. This makes it far more energy efficient than Proof-of-Work chains like Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nLike most Ethereum Layer 2 networks, Shibarium will also operate an EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine), allowing developers to easily deploy Ethereum-based smart contracts and dApps on the new network.\n\nMoreover, Shibarium developers intend to create a permissionless bridge between the two networks, making it easy to migrate Shiba Inu tokens from Ethereum to Shibarium.\n\nShibarium History: The Story So Far\n\nRyoshi, the founder of the Shiba Inu, teased the idea of an entire blockchain dedicated to the community as far back as May 2021. In the now-deleted blog post, Ryoshi envisioned a network where developers and users could create and explore applications that would expand the Shiba Inu ecosystem.\n\nShytoshi Kusama, the lead developer, has kept information about the development of Shibarium behind closed doors. The blockchain has been in the works for years, with the secrecy and mystique only adding to anticipation and excitement.\n\nThat all changed in March 2023 with the release of the Shibarium beta testnet. Nicknamed Puppynet, the test network is open to the public. This allows every member of the Shib Army to test dApps and products and deploy smart contracts in a risk-free environment.\n\nThe Shibarium puppynet is expected to be the final step in the development process before the official mainnet launch of the Shibarium blockchain.\n\nThe Shibarium Launch\n\nOn August 16, 2023, it finally happened. Shytoshi Kusama, the Shibarium development team, and the SHIB Army had poured years of blood, sweat, and tears into the iconic network. While Shibarium went live as expected, the architects behind Shiba Inu’s blockchain underestimated the demand.\n\nAmidst the excitement of Shibarium’s launch, extreme demand sent the network into a fail-safe ‘pause’ state, effectively halting the network. As expected, this outage caused fear, uncertainty, and doubt throughout the Shiba Inu community. Who’d have thought that after months of testing, Shibarium wouldn’t be able to handle the influx of users on launch day?\n\nShytoshi Kusama wasted no time in running community damage control, announcing in a blog post that there were no inherent technical issues with Shibarium or the bridge to the network. The outage was a simple security feature designed to protect users if the network was overwhelmed.\n\nWhile the Shibarium development team had expected a surge of users on launch day, the reality was that they simply didn’t purchase enough monthly compute units from Alchemy, their blockchain architecture provider.\n\nBased on testing, Shibarium is expected to need no more than 400 million monthly compute units. When the Shibarium launch expended over 160 million compute units in just half an hour, it became evident that Shibarium might be on track to become one of the most popular and active Layer 2 networks in the industry.\n\nThe Shibarium Bridge – Locked Funds\n\nEven after the halted network and ripples of FUD throughout the Shiba Inu community, the launch day drama was far from over. Wanting to be among the first to use Shibarium, hundreds of SHIB Army warriors attempted to bridge their funds to the network as quickly as possible.\n\nEager users were left wanting after the technical difficulties caused funds to be stuck in the...'}]

The recent Ethereum Shanghai upgrade has led to a record inflow of 572K ETH staked in a week, indicating growing interest in Ethereum's staking system. Additionally, an Ethereum ICO participant woke up to $4.42M in ETH after 8 years of dormancy, showcasing the potential for significant returns in the cryptocurrency market. However, Ethereum's price has been showing lower highs against Bitcoin, hinting at potential downside in April. Despite this, Ethereum institutional flows have surpassed Bitcoin, with $17 million flowing into Ethereum funds compared to $53.1 million outflow from Bitcoin. This suggests a mixed market sentiment with potential for further downside in Ethereum's price against Bitcoin in the short term.

"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain, news, and reflection analyst reports, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing a bearish trend in the short term due to the downward price movement and fluctuations in gas prices. However, the recent buy signal from the MACD indicator and the long-term bullish case for Ethereum, driven by technological advancements and increasing adoption, suggest a potential reversal in the near future.

Considering the market uncertainty caused by recent upgrades, options expiration, and external factors like a potential US recession, it is crucial to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains. By maintaining a slightly conservative and risk-averse approach, traders can navigate the volatile market environment effectively and position themselves for long-term success.

Therefore, I would take a trading action with a confidence level of 0.5, indicating a neutral stance. This decision reflects the need to balance short-term gains with long-term strategies, manage risks appropriately, and remain cautious in the current market conditions. By staying informed, monitoring key trends, and making strategic decisions, traders can maximize their overall profit potential in the ETH market.

This new offering allows users to earn staking rewards on their Ether holdings without locking up their assets, providing increased flexibility and liquidity. The product is designed to capitalize on the growing demand for Ethereum staking as the network transitions to Ethereum 2.0 and the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.\n\nThis move by Binance is expected to further solidify its position as a leading provider of staking services, while also catering to the needs of the Ethereum community. The introduction of Ether-based liquid staking reflects the rising popularity of staking services and the growing acceptance of Ethereum's Proof of Stake system.\n\nBinance says its new Ether-based liquid staking product lets users stake their Ether and get rewards without the hassle of running or delegating a validator node.

It currently has over $270 million in assets under management (AUM).\n\nIt is the first U.S.-registered fund to use a blockchain to process transactions and record share ownership.\n\nPolygon is the blockchain behind the 10th largest cryptocurrency by market cap, MATIC. It is a scaling platform for Ethereum, meaning that it works to make Ethereum faster and more efficient.\n\nHead of Digital Assets at Franklin Templetonton Roger Bayston said: “Extending the reach of the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund to Polygon enables the Fund to be further compatible with the rest of the digital ecosystem, specifically through an Ethereum-based blockchain.”\n\nDecrypt’s 2022 Crypto Project of the Year: Polygon\n\nColin Butler, Global Head of Institutional Capital at Polygon Labs, added that “Franklin Templetonton is at the forefront” of tokenizing assets.\n\nInvestors can buy shares of FOBXX and hold them in digital wallets via the Benji Investments mobile app.\n\nFranklin Templeton has long been involved in crypto: It announced a digital asset venture fund two years ago, and started digitizing shares for a money market fund on Stellar’s blockchain back in 2019.\n\nEditor's note: This article has been updated to correct Franklin Templeton's assets under management and reflect that the firm has had its fund on the Stellar network since 2019.\n\n"}, {'id': 15, 'time': 'Wed, 26 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Decentralized Exchange Vertex Launches on Ethereum Layer 2 Arbitrum - Yahoo Finance', 'content': 'Join the most important conversation in crypto and web3!

The firm, which has bases in Singapore and the Cayman Islands, counts Jane Street, Dexterity Capital, Hudson River Trading, GSR, Collab+Currency, JST Capital, Big Brain and Lunatic Capital among its early backers.\n\nThe messy collapse of FTX and other centralized trading platform blowups last year has fueled a shift toward decentralized exchanges and self-custody. Ethereum layer 2 system Arbitrum is now the fastest-growing blockchain in total value locked and has surpassed Ethereum in daily transaction volume.\n\nThe Vertex team has been working on the protocol for about a year. Co-founder Darius Tabatabai said the platform has drawn interest from institutional traders and from retail traders who use Arbitrum.\n\n“We built all the smart contracting ourselves, so we’re not forking anything,” Tabatabai said in an interview with CoinDesk. “The [automated market maker] is quite conventional, but we have a bunch of tech under the surface that enables you to do leveraged AMMs, to do looping, and we have an inbuilt money market. So you can think of it as a combination of Aave, dYdX and Uniswap, with an order book.”\n\nBuilding Vertex on Arbitrum and using an off-chain sequencer for the order book has enabled the venue to process between 10,000 and 15,000 transactions per second with the ability to match buy and sell orders in 10 to 30 milliseconds, a speed that rivals leading centralized venues and surpasses that on other decentralized exchanges, Tabatabai added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'}, {'id': 3, 'time': 'Wed, 26 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Ethereum's post-Merge energy usage shows how blockchain tech can align with national sustainability goals - Yahoo Finance", 'content': 'The Ethereum blockchain\'s energy usage initially plummeted more than 99 per cent last year after a change to its architecture, a new report confirms, showing how a new token minting and validation process better aligns with sustainability goals two years after China\'s crackdown on crypto mining.\n\nFollowing a change from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) for creating new ether last September, power demand on the network cratered to 235 kilowatts from 2.44 gigawatts, according to the latest Cambridge Blockchain Network Sustainability Index released on Wednesday. Amid rising usage of the network, energy consumption reached 420,000 kilowatt hours in March, the index shows.\n\nIn its report on the index, the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (CCAF) also notes that ether mining appeared to be of much less interest in China than bitcoin prior to the change. During Beijing\'s crackdown on mining activity in May 2021, the bitcoin network\'s hash rate, the measure of the network\'s computational power, was "far more severely" affected than Ethereum\'s, with each falling 71.1 per cent and 25.5 per cent, respectively.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

The crackdown two years ago briefly pushed measurable bitcoin mining activity in the country to near zero, although later data suggested much of that activity had largely moved underground.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe success of Ethereum\'s change in reducing energy usage shows how PoS blockchains can better align with green energy goals, which China has championed with a promise to reach peak carbon emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060.\n\nConcerns about the energy usage of cryptocurrency mining were widely seen as a potential factor in Beijing\'s crackdown.\n\nPoW blockchains like bitcoin\'s are so energy intensive because the process requires hashing, or solving increasingly complex math problems, to add new tokens to the network and verify transactions. With PoS, users "stake" their own tokens, or put up a specified amount as collateral, to verify transactions.\n\nEther\'s switch to PoS was teased for years before the stakeholders pushing the change were able to make it stick. The network went through multiple technical changes before the so-called Merge last year, according to the report.\n\nBitcoin\'s monthly energy consumption has remained consistently high.

Chart: SCMP>\n\nUntil the Merge, Ethereum\'s entire electricity consumption of 58.3 terawatt hours was more than Switzerland\'s average annual energy usage of 54.9 terawatt hours, according to the CCAF.\n\nEther is now estimated to consume 6.56 gigawatt hours of electricity annually, comparable to that of iconic structures such as the Eiffel Tower or the British Museum, the CCAF said.\n\nWhile the energy usage of Ethereum has climbed over the past several months, the CCAF said that is to be expected as more nodes and validators are added to the network. It is also still a far cry from what it used to consume and what the bitcoin network still consumes, which was 10.3 terawatt hours last month alone, more than 1,500 times Ethereum\'s annual consumption.\n\nThe bitcoin network\'s annual energy usage of 132.2 terawatt hours could power the entire country of Norway, according to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index.\n\nAmid a bitcoin price rally of about 75 per cent this year, the energy-intensive token remains the gold standard in cryptocurrency. However, governments are increasingly trying to balance innovation and sustainability goals regarding digital assets.\n\nBeijing has embraced blockchain technology and is promoting its development in the mainland. But with cryptocurrency illegal there, many projects focus on other uses of distributed ledger technologies.\n\nMeanwhile, Hong Kong\'s bid to become a regional virtual asset hub has received a nod of approval from mainland officials.

However, it comes with a number of UX improvements that incorporate the feedback received from the community.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThese UX improvements include transaction history, a visible progress bar, and a recent transaction panel with completion status.\n\nThe concept of ‘Bridges’ in the crypto space is quite popular as they facilitate the transfer of assets across different blockchain platforms. However, bridges transferred using zk-technology are much better than the regular ones as they are entirely governed by smart contracts, one on the Polygon zkEVM and the other on Ethereum.\n\nPolygon Bridge – Withdrawing Funds from Ethereum\n\nThe launch of this Polygon Bridge for Polygon zkEVM will allow users to withdraw funds from the Ethereum mainnet within just 30-60 minutes of initiating the withdrawal. The Polygon Bridge shall be supporting some of the users’ favorite assets such as ERC-20 tokens and the extended features of ERC-777 tokens.\n\nAlso, users of the Polygon Bridge won’t have to undergo the bridging process. Soon as the user triggers a bridging transaction, the bridged token will be automatically mapped. Most of the other platform require users to map their tokens before bridging. This could also take hours or even days. Thus, the Polygon Bridge cuts through these hurdles offering users a seamless experience.\n\nThe Polygon zkEVM launched last month as mainnet beta is open source, permissionless, and public.

The coin reached this height on November 16, 2021, just before the crypto winter started pushing crypto prices down.\n\nPolled finance professionals believe that ETH could reach its peak in 2023 at around $2,758. However, after that the price is expected to start dropping again in the second half of 2023, sinking to $2,342 by the end of the year.\n\nEthereum price prediction.

Meanwhile, half of the panelists believe that the update will result in greater scrutiny by the regulators.\n\nPost-Shapella Ethereum poll.

AI has been used for automated trading for some time now, as it can quickly identify chart patterns and trends.\n\nIn this line, Finbold used projections made by CoinPriceForecast which revealed that Ethereum will potentially manage to climb above the $2k mark by mid-2023 and surge to $2,146 by the end of the year.\n\nIt is worth noting that the AI prediction is less optimistic than the one provided by the polled experts, which projects the ETH price to be higher than that by year-end, even after it drops from the expected $2,758.\n\nHowever, if AI is correct, ETH would still see a 31% price surge by the end of the year compared to its price today.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

Now, they have turned their attention to planning what will ship next.\n\nThe consensus on Thursday’s bi-weekly all-core devs call, was that the upgrade, known as Cancun-Deneb — shortened to “Dencun” — will focus on a feature vital to the success of the network’s rollup-centric roadmap: proto-danksharding, the nickname for Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844.\n\nProto-danksharding introduces a new transaction type — the “blob-carrying transaction” — a temporary data storage mechanism that is expected to reduce transaction costs for users on layer-2 rollups, by orders of magnitude.\n\nPéter Szilágyi, team lead at the Ethereum foundation, summed up the overarching view in the Zoom room: “I kind of feel that 4844 should be the thing that everybody focuses on, and the rest is ‘nice to have’.”\n\nSzilágyi was the chief proponent of making 4844 a priority back in January, when he suggested it should take precedence over the withdrawal of staked ether in Shapella, but was overruled by his peers.\n\nThis time, he’s all but certain to get his wish. There was no disagreement that Cancun — the execution layer part of the upgrade that was the focus of the call — will have proto-danksharding front and center.\n\nBut what goes into Cancun besides 4844?\n\nDeactivate SELFDESTRUCT\n\nIt may sound like an urgent task for your movie hero of choice, but in Ethereum-speak it’s an “attempt at getting rid of the SELFDESTRUCT opcode in order to pave the road for statelessness.”\n\nThe concept of a stateless Ethereum goes back to co-founder Vitalik Buterin’s October 2017 post. “State” refers to all the key information at a point in time for the blockchain: all Ethereum accounts, their balances, all deployed smart contracts and the storage associated with these.\n\nA future upgrade or set of upgrades will shift responsibility for storing the blockchain’s full state to more specialized “archival nodes,” allowing for a much larger set of full nodes to store much less. That would make it even easier for anyone to run a node, furthering the goal of network decentralization.\n\nFor now, this precursor EIP-6780 was agreed to merit inclusion in Cancun by all client teams.\n\nCall moderator and project coordinator Tim Beiko concluded that “clearly the self-destruct [proposal] is the second most mentioned EIP beyond 4844.”\n\nHe noted that an external auditor has been hired to ascertain, using on-chain data, whether currently deployed smart contracts could be broken by the change. The results are about a month away, Beiko said, yet there was no objection to making plans for the destruction of SELFDESTRUCT now and, as pseudonymous Geth developer lightclient said, “revisit it after the report comes.”\n\nTransient storage\n\nOne EIP that was eighty-sixed from Shapella, despite being ready to go, was EIP-1153.\n\nEIP-1153 proposes new, cost-effective ways to temporarily store data in Ethereum smart contracts, improving communication between different parts of a transaction. This update would support various applications, such as enhanced security features and streamlined token approvals.\n\n“I don’t see much effort to push it out, so I don’t see a point for it to be delayed,” Lukasz Rozmej from the Nethermind client team said on the call.\n\nJustin Florentine from the Besu client team said, while he would stop short of calling 1153 “a must-have,” he remained in very strong support.\n\nEIP-1153, or “transient storage” is popular enough to have its own “fan page,” and was pushed hard by the Uniswap team in late 2022, in a manner that rubbed some Ethereum developers the wrong way.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nBut, in the intervening months, the proposal has truly become uncontroversial, and Erigon’s Andrew Ashikhmin tipped the consensus in favor of its inclusion when he singled it out for endorsement on the call as “a small EIP that people are mostly in favor of.”\n\nEOF remains a ways off\n\nOne upgrade that was also originally a part of Shanghai, known as EVM Object Format (EOF), was broadly lauded by the assembled core developers, but once again considered a poor match for the 4844-centered Cancun plan — essentially reaffirming the consensus from late March.\n\nThe EVM Object Format (EOF) is an extensible and versioned container format for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) that introduces a one-time validation during contract deployment. It aims to improve code and data separation, making it easier to introduce new features or deprecate old ones.\n\nLong-time Ethereum core developer Greg Colvin articulated the importance of getting EOF implemented from his perspective.\n\n“We’ve been discussing this for 7 years,” Colvin said.\n\nOther developers were of the opinion that EOF was “too big to be the second place in a fork,” as Ansgar Dietrichs, a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, put it. He suggested it should be the focus of the next major upgrade, called Prague.\n\nDann...'}]

Patrick McHenry (R-NC) during an appearance before a House Oversight Committee. Repeatedly asked to give his opinion as to whether Ethereum should be classified a security, and even confronted with Hinman\'s comments from 2018, Gensler refuses to answer the question.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe clip of Gensler\'s lecture at MIT is one of many recently surfaced by Twitter user "ZK_shark." Earlier this week, another clip shared by ZK_shark was retweeted by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, whose company is currently in the SEC\'s crosshairs over its Ethereum staking product. In the clip, Genlser says he believes most of the crypto market is made up of "non-securities." It\'s a statement that directly contradicts more recent comments as chair of the SEC in which he said he believes the "vast majority" of tokens in the crypto market are securities.\n\nMany have jumped in to criticize the regulator and former MIT teacher—but crypto lawyer Preston Byrne chimed in on Twitter by saying that Gensler speaking as a professor and then as a top regulator are two different things. “As a professor, he can talk about what things are in the abstract,” he wrote. “As a law enforcer, he’s required to enforce the laws as they’re written.”\n\nGensler Says Proof-of-Stake Assets Could Be Securities: Report\n\nGensler\'s refusal to answer lawmakers on whether Ethereum is security or a commodity is nothing new: Last year, he also refused to give a clear-cut answer when pressed. And crypto industry bigwigs—from lawyers to CEOs—have poked fun at the fact that Gensler has failed to answer straightforward questions in the past.\n\nI see a lot of people giving Gary Gensler a hard time over this but it’s important to note the different capacities in which he’s speaking.

It\'s the only crypto asset for which he\'s currently willing to give a public opinion.\n\nThe SEC has launched an intense crackdown on the crypto industry during Gensler\'s tenure—most recently targeting three U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchanges in as many months: Kraken, Bittrex, and Coinbase.\n\nSome political leaders in the U.S.—especially Republican lawmakers—have criticized the regulator for his latest actions.

Once again, I will let the below video speak for itself. Lecture 6: Smart Contracts and… pic.twitter.com/hsTvJ82XmM — zk-🦈 (@ZK_shark) April 28, 2023\n\nGensler, a civilian at the time and speaking only in his capacity as a professor, appeared to simply be relaying the opinions of the SEC back in 2018—specifically, the opinion expressed by former Director of Corporate Finance William Hinman in his much-cited "sufficiently decentralized" speech from June of that year.\n\nStill, the irony wasn\'t lost on Crypto Twitter—especially when juxtaposed against Gensler\'s recent duel with Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-NC) during an appearance before a House Oversight Committee. Repeatedly asked to give his opinion as to whether Ethereum should be classified a security, and even confronted with Hinman\'s comments from 2018, Gensler refuses to answer the question.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe clip of Gensler\'s lecture at MIT is one of many recently surfaced by Twitter user "ZK_shark." Earlier this week, another clip shared by ZK_shark was retweeted by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, whose company is currently in the SEC\'s crosshairs over its Ethereum staking product. In the clip, Genlser says he believes most of the crypto market is made up of "non-securities." It\'s a statement that directly contradicts more recent comments as chair of the SEC in which he said he believes the "vast majority" of tokens in the crypto market are securities.\n\nMany have jumped in to criticize the regulator and former MIT teacher—but crypto lawyer Preston Byrne chimed in on Twitter by saying that Gensler speaking as a professor and then as a top regulator are two different things. “As a professor, he can talk about what things are in the abstract,” he wrote. “As a law enforcer, he’s required to enforce the laws as they’re written.”\n\nGensler\'s refusal to answer lawmakers on whether Ethereum is security or a commodity is nothing new: Last year, he also refused to give a clear-cut answer when pressed. And crypto industry bigwigs—from lawyers to CEOs—have poked fun at the fact that Gensler has failed to answer straightforward questions in the past.\n\nI see a lot of people giving Gary Gensler a hard time over this but it’s important to note the different capacities in which he’s speaking. As a professor, he can talk about what things are in the abstract. As a law enforcer, he’s required to enforce the laws as they’re written. https://t.co/mYhd7Hm8I9 — Preston Byrne (@prestonjbyrne) April 26, 2023\n\nA security is a tradable financial asset that has monetary value—like stocks or bonds—that meets a specific legal definition as outlined by the so-called Howey Test.\n\nUnder U.S. law, an asset meets the definition of a security if it is an investment of money in a common enterprise from which there is an expectation of profit based on the efforts of others.\n\nGensler has said that Bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, is not a security—but rather a commodity. It\'s the only crypto asset for which he\'s currently willing to give a public opinion.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe SEC has launched an intense crackdown on the crypto industry during Gensler\'s tenure—most recently targeting three U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchanges in as many months: Kraken, Bittrex, and Coinbase.\n\nSome political leaders in the U.S.—especially Republican lawmakers—have criticized the regulator for his latest actions. They claim he is stifling regulation in the world’s largest economy and forcing American tech companies overseas.'}, {'id': 3, 'time': 'Fri, 28 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Better Buy: Ethereum or Bitcoin? - The Motley Fool', 'content': 'Despite a recent pullback in the crypto market, both Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) continue to be two of the best-performing cryptos. Bitcoin is up about 80% for the year, while Ethereum is up about 60%. On the surface, it would appear that Bitcoin is clearly the superior investment in 2023.\n\nHowever, two market indicators paint a different picture of what\'s happening in the crypto market right now. Here\'s a closer look at how Ethereum stacks up with Bitcoin on a relative basis.\n\nBitcoin\'s correlation with Ethereum\n\nCorrelations are incredibly important in the crypto markets. For example, any time the correlation of Bitcoin with gold tightens, it usually signals that investors are about to pile into Bitcoin as a safe-haven investment. Investors also use the correlation of Bitcoin with broad market indexes such as the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq 100 to gauge how the market currently views crypto as a risky asset. The tighter the correlation between Bitcoin and the Nasdaq, the thinking goes, the more that investors are viewing Bitcoin as just a slightly riskier tech stock.\n\nBut there\'s another correlation that many investors are not talking about, and that\'s the correlation between Bitcoin and Ethereum. The conventional wisdom is that the correlation between the two is very close to 1.0, so it\'s not really worth tracking. However, Coinbase Global (NASDAQ: COIN) made waves earlier this month when it published a report showing how the correlation between Bitcoin and Ethereum appears to be declining, from a level of 0.95 in mid-March to a level of 0.82 in mid-April. That might not seem like a big deal, but it is for institutional investors. It directly impacts risk management and sophisticated hedging techniques.\n\nThere are a number of different factors that might be responsible for this shift, including Ethereum\'s recent tech upgrade in March. If this trend persists, it could signal that Ethereum is finally uncoupling from Bitcoin and going its own way. That would be a net positive for Ethereum because it would fundamentally challenge the simplistic "Bitcoin is gold, Ethereum is silver" investment narrative.\n\nThe Ethereum/Bitcoin currency pair\n\nSince both Bitcoin and Ethereum are digital currencies, it makes sense to evaluate them from the perspective of a foreign exchange trader. One way of doing this is by tracking the performance of the Ethereum/Bitcoin currency pair over time. By doing so, you can immediately see when Ethereum is "strengthening" against Bitcoin and when it is "weakening" against Bitcoin. In much the same way, a foreign exchange trader could see when the U.S. dollar is strengthening or weakening against the Euro (or some other currency).\n\nData by Trading View\n\nAs can be seen from the chart above, the current value of the Ethereum/Bitcoin currency pair is approximately 0.066. This is derived from dividing the current price of Ethereum ($1,915) by the current price of Bitcoin ($28,964). The value of the Ethereum/Bitcoin currency pair has traded, by and large, in a relatively narrow range of 0.06 to 0.08 since mid-2021. From a historical perspective, this value is actually quite high. In the period from 2019 to 2021, for example, the value typically ranged from 0.02 to 0.03. The big breakout came during the last crypto bull market rally when the number of possible use cases for Ethereum exploded. On the graph, it\'s possible to see a huge spike right around March 2021.\n\nPutting all this together, it\'s possible to create an investment thesis around Ethereum and Bitcoin. Ever since 2021, Ethereum seems to be gaining in value on a relative basis vs. Bitcoin. Another way to think about this is that as Ethereum continues to introduce new technological upgrades and expand its ecosystem, it is "strengthening" against Bitcoin and becoming a better investment. If you think about the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem as an economy, then this becomes intuitively clear. In the same way, one would expect the U.S. dollar to strengthen if the U.S. economy strengthens.\n\nDoes the data favor Ethereum?\n\nOverall, a case can be made that Ethereum is not just a better investment than Bitcoin right now, but that it\'s also becoming a better investment over time. Ethereum clearly has a more diversified blockchain ecosystem than Bitcoin and offers a whole range of products and offerings -- such as NFTs, blockchain gaming, metaverse worlds, and decentralized finance (DeFi) -- that Bitcoin simply can\'t match. Bitcoin is, first and foremost, a method of payment.\n\nThus, if you\'re a Bitcoin maximalist, you might want to take a closer look at the changing relationship between Bitcoin and Ethereum. Right now, it looks like Ethereum after The Merge is stronger, better, and more diversified than it has ever been, and investors are starting to recognize this. At some point, say some crypto investors, Ethereum could eventually "flip" Bitcoin and become the most valuable cryptocurrency in the world.'}]

Led by the Tron Foundation, can this scalable network separate itself from the fierce competition and fulfill its destiny to become a truly decentralized internet?\n\nWhat Is Tron (TRX)?\n\nTron is a Layer-1 blockchain network that aims to provide a frictionless and accessible decentralized internet for the masses. Like most blockchains, Tron features an account-based structure, meaning anyone can create a wallet and store their digital assets on a public ledger.\n\nThe Tron network was initially designed to provide a global entertainment platform where content creators could easily share their work worldwide. While Tron still supports these features, the network has also grown to offer a range of blockchain-based applications, like DeFi apps and NFT functionality.\n\nHow Does Tron Work?\n\nWhat’s interesting about Tron is that from the get-go, the team never promised to bring any wildly new innovations or progressions in blockchain technology. Everything from Tron’s consensus mechanism to its programming language was recycled from other networks, drawing criticism from experts.\n\nDespite this, Tron has become one of the largest blockchains in the crypto industry, both in terms of user count and market cap.\n\nThe Tron Blockchain’s Consensus Mechanism\n\nA delegated-Proof-of Stake consensus secures the Tron blockchain. In this DPoS chain, Tron token holders delegate their tokens to validator node operators. These validators, called Super Representatives, are responsible for producing new blocks on the network and representing their stakers in matters of protocol governance.\n\nEvery six hours, 27 Super Representatives (SRs) are chosen from a selection pool of over 100 SR Partners, who are in turn shortlisted from over 300 SR Candidates. The 27 chosen Super Representatives earn TRX tokens as a reward for creating new blocks and securing the Tron blockchain.\n\nNew blocks are created every three seconds and added to the circulating supply, with each new block rewarding the chosen Super Representative with 32 TRX coins.\n\nTron Network Architecture\n\nThe Tron blockchain operates a TVM (Tron Virtual Machine), which records all accounts and transactions on the network and enables developers to build and deploy smart contracts on the Tron Mainnet.\n\nWhile similar to an EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine), the Tron network is not EVM-compatible. Cryptocurrency tokens on the Tron network follow the rules set by the TRC-20 token standard, unsurprisingly similar to Ethereum’s ERC-20 standard.\n\nAs outlined in the Tron whitepaper, the main infrastructure of the Tron blockchain is broken down into three layers. Separating network responsibilities into different layers helps ease congestion and scale the blockchain.\n\nCore Layer – The Tron core layer handles computational instructions written in Java or Solidity. Transactions are then sent to the Tron Virtual Machine, which executes code logic.\n\nApplication Layer – Users and developers interact with this layer to execute on-chain transactions and deploy decentralized applications, products, and services.\n\nStorage Layer – As the name suggests, the storage layer records blockchain data and keeps a live register of the state of the network and all Tron-based smart contracts.\n\nTron Blockchain Performance\n\nDespite not boasting any revolutionary new technologies or innovative features, the Tron network achieves high levels of scalability and decentralization. Tron claims that its network can reach a maximum transaction throughput of around 2,000 TPS (transactions per second).\n\nOn top of that, transaction fees on the network are typically low, with users expecting to pay around $0.000005 per transaction. In this respect, the Tron blockchain is comparable to Ripple (XRP).\n\nThese are impressive figures compared to certain Layer-1 networks like Ethereum and BNB Chain, which respectively struggle to hit 15 TPS and 150 TPS. However, Tron still falls short of networks like Solana and Aptos, which theoretically handle over 100,000 transactions per second while maintaining low transaction fees.\n\nThe Tronix token\n\nThe native token of the Tron blockchain, Tronix, is used to pay transaction fees and secure the network through Tron’s DPos consensus mechanism.\n\nTRX tokens are also used as the main currency o...'}]

Briefly stated, smart contracts are computer programs installed and run on a blockchain network, providing deterministic assurances that permit multiple parties to reach an accepted tamper-proof outcome. A smart contract platform is a blockchain that provides programming and testing services for smart contracts. It serves as a framework for dApp development. On blockchain networks, smart contracts can be created using a variety of programming languages. The top five blockchain programming languages for smart contracts are listed below:\n\n1. Solidity: Solidity is the most widely used Blockchain programming language for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It is a high-level language that is similar to JavaScript and is specifically designed for creating smart contracts. Solidity has a large developer community and offers many features for secure, decentralized programming.\n\n2. Vyper: Vyper is a newer blockchain programming language that was created specifically for smart contract development on the Ethereum blockchain. It is similar to Solidity but with a focus on simplicity and security. Vyper is designed to be more secure than Solidity by limiting the number of features available to developers.\n\n3. Rust: Rust is a general-purpose programming language growing in popularity for blockchain development. It is known for its security and performance features and is used to create smart contracts on several blockchain platforms, including Polkadot and Solana.\n\n4. C++: C++ is a popular programming language for creating blockchain applications, including smart contracts. It is known for its speed and efficiency and is used to create smart contracts on several blockchain platforms, including EOS and NEO.\n\n5. JavaScript: JavaScript is a widely used programming language for web development, but it can also be used to create smart contracts on some blockchain platforms, such as Ethereum.

It has many strengths, not least the fact that it’s decentralized, secure, an excellent way to store value, and pretty much censorship-resistant. This makes it useful for all manner of things; some anticipated and desirable, some less so.\n\nI’m also a major admirer of Ethereum. It is also highly decentralized, and it has a fantastic community of developers and builders who have created thousands of useful and utterly new applications on Ethereum.\n\nIt’s also a little expensive, scaling it has involved a lot of compromises and a confusing array of solutions, its governance is tricky, and the manner of its launch made a few people who probably deserved it very rich (as well as a couple of folks who were just lucky enough to be in the room at the time).\n\nAnd I’m excited about lots of other foundational blockchains, some of which have features they don’t really share with Ethereum or Bitcoin, some of which are optimized for transaction cost, or volume, or some other metric.\n\nI try to imagine what it must be like to assert, contrary to logical analysis, that MY blockchain is the ONLY blockchain.\n\nAnd I guess it must be the equivalent of having just one tool in your garage, a drill, and wanting to use that drill for every home improvement project.\n\nHanging some drywall? Drill it! Repairing the stucco? Drill it! Fixing the plumbing? Drill it!\n\nOf course, we can’t necessarily have exactly the right tool for every single situation. Your car, for example, may be a compromise car.\n\nMaybe you own a Toyota Camry. It’s not designed to go extremely fast around corners. It wouldn’t be much good off-road. It doesn’t haul half a ton of lumber.\n\nEssentially the Camry is the Ethereum of cars. It does a bit of everything, which makes it a great solution for people who need their car to do a bit of everything.\n\nBut let’s say you need your blockchain to be very, very good at one thing.\n\nFor instance, you are designing for the billion or so gamers out there.\n\nGamers don’t want to pay little fees every time they mint an NFT achievement like clearing a level in record time, or collect an item they might use in a sequel.\n\nSo maybe you need a blockchain that has no fees.\n\nThat takes some pretty specialist design. Ethereum can’t, by its very nature, support that precise need.\n\nMaybe you need your blockchain to be more private, or more secure, or much faster, or infinitely scalable, or to support some novel quantum-resistant cryptography. There are lots of reasons you might be prepared to trade all the usefulness of Ethereum for something very, very specific to your needs.\n\nIn which case, maximalism is exposed as a fraud.\n\nSure, clever folks have figured out lots of workarounds to make Ethereum more useful. In much the same way that Toyota figured out a nicer set of features to appeal to the customer who orders the loaded Camry – a better stereo, a more powerful engine, quad exhaust tips (don’t get me started).\n\nBut a very nicely-equipped Camry is still not a Mercedes.\n\nNo matter how you slice it, Ethereum is a general use blockchain suitable for most general uses.\n\nIt is not the answer to every single real-life use case.\n\nWhich is why maximalism, in all its forms, no matter what blockchain the maximalist is maximizing, is an indication of a minimalist level of intellectual curiosity and honesty.\n\nNot to mention: We’re ostensibly all in this together, right? We all want roughly the same thing: A better way of doing things, for the betterment of our experience on this planet?\n\nWe get there by collaborating, cooperating, working to find the right tool for the right job. Not by screaming at each other for daring to suggest that a general-purpose blockchain may not fit every use case.\n\nEthereum is a great innovation, it has a wonderful community and almost endless uses. Bitcoin is a remarkable and world-changing accomplishment, one that has opened countless minds to new possibilities.\n\nNeither of them is perfect.

Ever since Satoshi Nakamoto first published the Bitcoin (BTC) white paper, distributed ledger technology (DLT) has exploded in popularity. Many crypto enthusiasts don’t know blockchain systems aren’t the only decentralized network.\n\nWhile they have plenty of similarities, DAG-based networks like Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) and IOTA (MIOTA) work slightly differently from traditional blockchains like Ethereum (ETH).\n\nWhat is a directed acyclic graph? Are DAG networks truly better equipped to handle real-world use cases?\n\nThis article will explore the basics of DAG technology and how it stacks up against blockchain networks.\n\nWhat Is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)?\n\nA directed acyclic graph, or DAG, is a distributed digital ledger that records transactions and stores cryptocurrency. Like a Layer 1 blockchain, some DAG networks support smart contracts and host innovative dApps and DeFi products.\n\nTo the untrained eye, using a DAG isn’t very different from using a traditional blockchain. However, looking under the hood, you’ll find that DAG-based networks use a slightly different data structure.\n\nHow Do Directed Acyclic Graphs Work?\n\nIn a blockchain, new blocks are validated by nodes or miners and added to the network. Nodes validate new transactions by confirming their data against the recorded history of previous transactions in the last block.\n\nIf a blockchain resembles a chain of blocks, a DAG looks more like a tree with unclosed vertices and edges. Every node in a DAG-based model can have more than one parent root, meaning multiple new transactions can be validated simultaneously. Instead of referencing only the last block, DAG nodes reference previous transactions from any node in the network.\n\nIn a directed acyclic graph, interconnected nodes build off each other and reference multiple transactions. This theoretically makes them more expansive and eases network congestion.\n\nLike traditional blockchains, nodes achieve network validation by ‘agreeing’ on the network state through consensus algorithms. Generally speaking, DAG networks use the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism due to its low energy consumption.\n\nWhich Crypto Projects Use DAG Technology?\n\nDespite being a relatively new DLT system, DAG-based networks are proving popular within the crypto market. Crypto projects like Hadera Hashgraph and Fantom (FTM) are built using DAG technology to great effect. They are supporting thousands of users within their thriving ecosystems.\n\nOther projects include IOTA, a directed acyclic graph designed to support Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, and Nano, a decentralized payment network.\n\nDistributed Ledger Technology (DLT) Compared: DAG vs. Blockchain\n\nWhile it’s important to understand how directed acyclic graphs work, most people are more interested in results. How does DAG technology fare against traditional blockchain standards?\n\nScalability\n\nDAG networks were invented to solve some of the scalability issues faced by legacy Proof-of-Work blockchains, including high transaction fees and low throughput.\n\nSpeed\n\nOn paper, a directed acyclic graph can reach consensus and process transactions faster than blockchain networks. Why? Blockchains are only able to create one new block at a time, and cannot begin producing a new block until the previous one has been completed.\n\nIn contrast, nodes in DAG-based networks can reference multiple other operators simultaneously. In Hadera Hashgraph’s Gossip protocol (pictured below), nodes share information with each exponentially, meaning large amounts of data flow freely across the network quickly, helping nodes reach validation quickly.\n\nWhile this sounds great in theory, DAG-based networks like Hadera Hashgraph and Fantom still can’t achieve the same transaction speeds that we see in top PoS chains like Solana (SOL) or Aptos (APT).\n\nCosts\n\nCompared with legacy traditional blockchains like Ethereum and Avalanche, DAG-based networks are more affordable. Transaction fees on Hadera Hashgraph cost as little as a fraction of a penny, while a similar transaction on Ethereum might set you back a few dollars.\n\nThe competition gets a bit tighter between Fantom and Avalanche, with both networks demanding only a few cents to process transactions. It’s also important to mention that network demand plays an important role here. While Ethereum, Avalanche, and Fantom have all witnessed spikes in gas prices due to congestion, Hadera Hashgraph’s scalability hasn’t been truly tested yet.\n\nEnergy Efficiency\n\nIf there is an area where DAGs shine, it is their sustainability. Directed acyclic graphs typically boast low energy consumption rates, making them an ideal candidate for global adoption.\n\nTo give you an idea, the Fantom network uses between 0.000024-0.000028 kWh to process a single transaction. While it has made huge strides in reducing its environmental impact by moving to a PoS ...'}]

ETH retested $1,825 and is showing a few bearish signs.\n\nEthereum struggled to settle above the $1,925 and $1,940 resistance levels.\n\nThe price is trading below $1,880 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nThere was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $1,895 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).\n\nThe pair could continue to move down if it clears the $1,800 support zone.\n\nEthereum Price Drops Again\n\nEthereum’s price started a fresh increase above the $1,850 zone. ETH struggled to settle above the $1,925 and $1,940 resistance levels, similar to Bitcoin at $29,500.\n\nA high was formed near $1,939 and the price started a fresh decline. There was a sharp decline below the $1,900 and $1,880 levels. Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $1,895 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nA low is formed near $1,825 and the price is now consolidating losses. Ether price is now trading below $1,880 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nImmediate resistance is near the $1,850 level. It is close to the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,939 swing high to the $1,825 low. The next major resistance seems to be forming near $1,900 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.\n\nSource: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $1,939 swing high to the $1,825 low is also near the $1,900 level. A close above the $1,900 level might start a fresh increase. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $1,940 resistance. Any more gains could send Ether toward the $2,000 resistance.\n\nMore Losses in ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $1,900 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,825 level.\n\nThe next major support is near the $1,800 zone, below which ether price might drop toward the $1,740 support zone. Any more losses may perhaps take the price toward $1,700 in the near term.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is now gaining momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is well below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level – $1,800\n\nMajor Resistance Level – $1,900\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

ETH managed to push to a new YTD high during mid-month but investors’ confidence has dwindled since.\n\nHowever, there is one aspect of the network that may rejuvenate investors’ interest.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nAlthough ETH’s price action has been affected by shifting market dynamics, there is one area in which Ethereum has maintained a more pleasing performance.\n\nAccording to a recent Glassnode report, ETH 2.0 deposit contracts have been experiencing robust growth and recently reached a new all-time high.\n\n? #Ethereum $ETH Total Value in the ETH 2.0 Deposit Contract just reached an ATH of 18,868,062 ETH View metric:https://t.co/SzbMPqvhlb pic.twitter.com/B9sqXP3t8s — glassnode alerts (@glassnodealerts) April 30, 2023\n\nBut what does it mean for the network? Well, the higher deposit contracts reflect more confidence in the network.\n\nIt also reflects the growing amount of ETH staked. The total value of ETH staked stood at slightly over 19 million ETH and was at a new all-time high (ATH), at the time of writing.\n\nUnderstanding the lack of price correlation\n\nAlthough ETH staked and deposit contracts have reached new highs, ETH’s price action has not necessarily reaped the benefits. This is largely because the cryptocurrency has experienced outflows since the second week of April.\n\nAs a result, its price tanked by a significant margin. ETH’s $1918 press time price represented a 10.8% discount from its current 2023 high.\n\nSo why is ETH still holding back? Well, part of the reason is that whales have been trimming their balances. Addresses holding over 1000 ETH have contributed to selling pressure since the second week of April.\n\nPrecisely, the selling pressure from whales continued especially in the second half of April. As a result, bullish expectations were curtailed, and sell pressure was fueled by leveraged long liquidations. This brings us to the question of- What to expect in the first half of May.\n\nRealistic or not, here’s Ethereum market cap in BTC’s terms\n\nWe observed a slight recovery in open interest in the last five days, as well as an increase in demand for leverage.\n\nThe recovery suggests that the market condition is improving gradually, but it also indicates low demand. As noted earlier, ETH whales are still selling. This means the bulls may still not show off their strength until the whales cease selling and contribute to bullish volumes.'}, {'id': 3, 'time': 'Mon, 01 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Phantom Solana Wallet Adds Ethereum and Polygon Support - Decrypt', 'content': 'Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub.

Vogelsteller had recently indicated that Hoskinson made no meaningful contributions to Ethereum.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nNotably, three of Ethereum’s co-founders, Hoskinson, Vogelsteller, and Gavin Wood, left Ethereum and launched their respective networks. Responding to a two-year-old tweet that compared the progress of these networks, Vogelsteller noted that the comparison is only between LUKSO, the chain he founded, and Gavin Wood’s Polkadot network.\n\nTo correct this picture a little bit:@VitalikButerin is the ethereum founder, so he doesn’t count. @IOHK_Charles was never really a founder of ethereum. He built literally nothing for ethereum that I am aware of. He was just early on at the right place, at the time, hanging… https://t.co/zHFV4zLANR — Fabian Vogelsteller (@feindura) April 29, 2023\n\nHe stressed that Hoskinson cannot be regarded as an Ethereum co-founder because “He built literally nothing for Ethereum that I am aware of.” According to Vogelsteller, Hoskinson was only fortunate to be at the right place at the right time “hanging out.”\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nTo buttress his point, Vogelsteller argued that he had been involved in Ethereum long before the network was formed and is fully aware of who made valuable contributions to the launch. He mentioned that the primary work that birthed the network was done before 2014, when most of the “co-founders” were onboard.\n\nHoskinson Responds\n\nResponding to Vogelsteller, Hoskinson employed his usual tactic of sarcasm, expressing gratitude to Vogelsteller for his comments. “[…] given my profound incompetence, I’d love to meet the people behind Cardano. Pretty cool project to just somehow self-manifest,” Hoskinson sarcastically remarked.\n\n“I suppose Switzerland just materialized out of the ether,” he said.\n\nThanks Fabian. Glad to get your opinion on my worth and contributions. I suppose Switzerland just materialized out of the ether. Also given my profound incompetence, I'd love to meet the people behind Cardano. Pretty cool project to just somehow self manifest — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) April 30, 2023\n\nIt bears mentioning that Hoskinson is regarded as one of the biggest contributors to Ethereum, helping to launch the Ethereum Foundation and the ICO in June 2014, which raised 31,000 BTC.\n\nHoskinson registered the Foundation in Switzerland and served as CEO briefly before leaving to form IOHK in 2015 and Cardano in 2017. Hoskinson left due to disagreement on whether Ethereum should be for-profit or non-profit. He had argued that the project should be for-profit, while Vitalik Buterin disagreed. While there are reports that Hoskinson left willingly, others claim Buterin fired him.\n\nThe recent incident with Vogelsteller is not the first public disagreement between two Ethereum co-founders, as Hoskinson and Buterin had also thrown subtle jabs at each other in the past. Last December, as The Crypto Basic reported, Hoskinson sarcastically swiped at Buterin over his comments on Elon Musk’s search for a new Twitter CEO."}, {'id': 4, 'time': 'Mon, 01 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'More TPS, less gas: Ethereum L2 Starknet outlines performance upgrades - Cointelegraph', 'content': 'Layer-2 blockchain protocols have been in the spotlight in 2023, bringing major performance improvements to a variety of platforms and services operating in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nZero-knowledge (ZK) proofs have been key in the roll-out of a variety of layer 2s, with the technology pioneered by the decentralized scaling network Starknet. StarkWare, the technology firm behind the scaling platform, has outlined plans to further improve its layer-2 network to meet an expected increase in users and developers through the rest of the year.\n\nCointelegraph caught up with Eli Ben-Sasson, president and co-founder of StarkWare, to unpack key points set out in a 2023 roadmap for Starknet. Chief among a list of to-dos is performance improvements that are centered around higher throughput and reduced latency of Starknet’s network.\n\nBen-Sasson highlighted the focus on performance upgrades that are expected to deliver significantly higher transactions per second (TPS) than on Ethereum’s mainnet at lower gas costs:\n\n“The most important thing is for builders and developers to have high throughput so that they can really build. Starknet is about increasing the computational abilities of Ethereum and we just want to provide this raw power to the hands of developers.”\n\nStarknet v0.12.0 is expected to be released in the next month and is the culmination of a six-month sprint that involves transitioning Starknet’s development stack to a Rust-based Sequencer as well as an open-source project that has built a Rust-Cairo virtual machine.\n\nStarkWare open-sourced its programming language compiler Cairo early in 2023, with the language aimed at driving the development of ZK-rollup and validity-proof-powered decentralized applications (DApps).\n\nRelated: Privacy, scaling drives use cases for zero-knowledge technology\n\nBen-Sasson added that Starknet continues to chase an ambitious target of processing at least 10 times the throughput of Ethereum at a tenth of the cost. He highlighted StarkEx’s ability to deliver significant TPS on the decentralized exchange dYdX. StarkEx is another layer-2 scaling engine developed by StarkWare.\n\nAt times, dYdX processes up to 54 transactions per second, while the average TPS of Ethereum is around 10–12. Ben-Sasson also noted that these dYdX transactions are roughly four to five times larger than those on Ethereum, which bodes well for the improved scaling capabilities of Starknet in the near future:\n\n“We’re often experiencing practical TPS or gas usage that is orders of magnitude greater than what Ethereum can deal with. I’m very confident that this will also be replicated on Starknet.”\n\nPerformance improvements have been prioritized as a result of developer and user feedback highlighting delays in transaction processing on Starknet. The next port of call is the reduction of transaction costs, which will be addressed by targeting the cost of storing data on Ethereum’s mainnet.\n\n“We’re going to roll out Volition, which allows users to opt as to whether they want their data on or off-chain and this will be part of the base layer of the Starknet system.”\n\nBen-Sasson said the release of off-chain data availability will complement Ethereum’s in-development improvement proposal “Proto-Danksharding” Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, which will introduce a new type of transaction that carries binary large objects or “blobs.” The EIP fundamentally aims to provide cheaper transactions.\n\nStarknet is also aiming to deliver faster finality further down the 2023 roadmap, which will produce shorter and fixed interval block times on the network. This will be carried out with the introduction of a fee market to prioritize Starknet’s network resources on users’ willingness to pay for transactions, inspired by conventional market systems:\n\n“Market mechanisms are a very good way to solve this. Blockchain didn’t invent this — blockchains adopted this from just the conventional world. That’s how you prioritize resources and allow users to signal this.”\n\nA number of Ethereum layer-2 protocols have begun rolling out ZK-rollups to further improve efforts to provide faster and cheaper transactions to the smart contract blockchain network.

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
The Ethereum price has shown vulnerability to a bigger correction as it struggled to break above key resistance levels and is currently trading below the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The recent decline in price could continue if the $1,800 support zone is breached, potentially leading to further losses towards the $1,740 and $1,700 support levels. Additionally, the increase in ETH 2.0 deposit contracts indicates growing confidence in the network, despite the price not reflecting this positive development. The introduction of Ethereum and Polygon support on the Phantom wallet may also contribute to increased user adoption and activity in the Ethereum ecosystem. Overall, the market trend for Ethereum appears to be bearish in the short term due to technical indicators and resistance levels, but the long-term outlook remains positive with advancements in layer-2 scaling solutions and network improvements.

NEWS ANALYST REPORT:
"""
The Ethereum price has shown vulnerability to a bigger correction as it struggled to break above key resistance levels and is currently trading below the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The recent decline in price could continue if the $1,800 support zone is breached, potentially leading to further losses towards the $1,740 and $1,700 support levels. Additionally, the increase in ETH 2.0 deposit contracts indicates growing confidence in the network, despite the price not reflecting this positive development. The introduction of Ethereum and Polygon support on the Phantom wallet may also contribute to increased user adoption and activity in the Ethereum ecosystem. Overall, the market trend for Ethereum appears to be bearish in the short term due to technical indicators and resistance levels, but the long-term outlook remains positive with advancements in layer-2 scaling solutions and network improvements.

Experts Sreeram Kannan and Konstantin Lomashuk go deep into all things staking, and how to understand the risks.'}, {'id': 4, 'time': 'Tue, 02 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'How to Bridge From Solana to Ethereum - Watcher Guru', 'content': 'Solana has advanced significantly in the DeFi, NFT, and Web3 markets since its launch in April 2019. Hundreds of projects are currently underway in Solana, and more are soon to follow.\n\nAccording to Solana’s website, “low cost, forever” is the company’s main selling proposition. The network is engaged in direct competition with several blockchains, including Ethereum. Even though there is competition between different blockchains, users would want to bridge from Solana to the Ethereum network. Before we dive into the detailed steps on how to bridge, let us understand what is bridging.\n\nBridging in a nutshell\n\nBridging is nothing but the process of transferring tokens or coins from one blockchain to another one. This is essential as there exist multiple blockchains with each one having their native tokens or coins. The bridge helps to move the assets from one blockchain to another, making the process easier. The process exists in general, especially for cryptocurrencies that don’t have cross-chain support. Bridging is possible through cross-chain bridges and sidechains, etc.\n\nInteroperability between Solana and Ethereum is a fascinating breakthrough in the field of blockchains. It allows users to effortlessly transfer assets between the Solana and Ethereum networks.\n\nNow that we have a basic understanding of bridging, let us focus on how to bridge from Solana to Ethereum.\n\nHow to bridge from Solana to Ethereum with Allbridge\n\nThere are a few options to look into while bridging from Solana to Ethereum. Let us look at how to do it with Allbridge. Allbridge helps to connect EVM networks like Polgon, and Ethereum with non-EVM chains like Solana, Fantom, and Near.\n\nFollow the steps below to bridge your tokens from Solana to Ethereum:\n\nGo to Allbridge.\n\nConnect your Solley, Phantom, or Exodus wallet.\n\nChoose the option from Solana to Ethereum.\n\nType in the address, select the number of tokens, and click on send to finalize the transaction.\n\nHow to Bridge From Solana To Ethereum using Portal\n\nPreviously known as Wormhole Bridge, Portal Bridge is another good option to go for to move assets between these blockchains. The portal also has better liquidity for various tokens. Here is how you can bridge tokens using Portal Bridge.\n\nVisit the Portal Bridge website.\n\nConnect your Ethereum and Solana wallets.\n\nChoose the token that you want to bridge from SOL and ETH networks.\n\nType in the number of tokens that you want to transfer.\n\nDouble-check and confirm the transaction.\n\nUsing a CEX\n\nWhile the above two options are available, it is also possible to do bridging using a CEX. But doing so also comes with the security risks of a CEX, which one should be wary of. Follow the steps below to bridge tokens from SOL to the ETH network.\n\nOpen your CEX account.\n\nGo to your wallet and transfer ETH from your wallet.\n\nOnce you receive the assets, convert your crypto to a native token, like SOL.\n\nWithdraw your SOL and then send it to your Solana wallet.\n\nWhile it is always better to use portals like Allbridge and Portal, CEX can also be considered as an option to do so. However, CEXs include the necessity to do KYC and submit personal information.'}, {'id': 2, 'time': 'Tue, 02 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ether whale population drops after Shapella — Will ETH price sink too? - Cointelegraph', 'content': 'The share of Ether held by so-called whale addresses has dropped since Ethereum\'s Shapella upgrade in mid April, suggesting that large investors may be leaning bearish in the near term.\n\nETH whale population shrinks post-Shapella\n\nThe amount of Ether (ETH) held by addresses with 1,000-10,000 ETH, or "whales," was over 14.033 million ETH on May 1, according to Glassnode data. In comparison, the count was 14.167 million ETH on April 12, when Shapella went live on Ethereum.\n\nEther whale net position change. Source: Glassnode\n\nInterestingly, a week before the Shapella upgrade, the Ether whale cohort held 14.303 million ETH, the highest amount in 2023.\n\n"Shrimps" only ones buying ETH since Shapella\n\nEther\'s price is down over 3.5% since the Shapella upgrade — suggesting that several whales may have indeed "sold the news."\n\nInterestingly, other address cohorts also showed a decline, including sharks (100-1,000 ETH), fishes (10-100 ETH), crabs (1-10 ETH) and even mega-whales (10,000+ ETH).\n\nOnly shrimps (<1 ETH) accumulated during the period, with their net position slightly increasing from 1.79 million ETH on April 12 to 1.80 million ETH on May 1.\n\nEther shrimp net position change. Source: TradingView\n\nShapella enabled investors to withdraw ETH locked via staking, which some argued would increase selling pressure.\n\nSince the Shapella upgrade, investors have withdrawn over 1.97 million ETH worth around $3.6 billion, according to Beaconcha.in. Nevertheless, no major changes in cryptocurrency exchanges\' ETH balances have been seen to date.\n\nEther whales vs. shrimps\n\nHistorically, fewer Ether whales typically means heightened downside risk for the ETH price.\n\nWhale activity typically acts as a leading market indicator. So, rich investors accumulating typically precedes a price rise and vice versa.\n\nThe price-to-whale positive correlation existed until March 2020, as shown in the chart below. Afterward, retail mania took over alongside the Federal Reserve\'s quantitative easing, and the correlation snapped.\n\nEther whale net position change. Source: Glassnode\n\nNotably, ETH rallied from $110 in March 2020 to over $4,950 in November 2021 despite the declining number of whales. The inverse correlation continued throughout the price downtrend to around $850 in June 2022.\n\nBut since then, whale holdings have risen by nearly 1 million ETH. Meanwhile, ETH\'s price has more than doubled to around $1,850, hinting at a possible return of the price-to-whale correlation, which would be a bullish sign for Ether.\n\nWhere can the ETH price go next?\n\nThe $2,000 level is an important psychological resistance level for ETH/USD that bulls have been unable to break despite multiple attempts in 2023.\n\nRelated: Ethereum price outlook weakens, but ETH derivatives suggest $1.6K is unlikely\n\nOn the daily chart, ETH/USD holds above the short-term support provided by its 50-day exponential moving average (EMA), near $1,840.

Understanding the Risks and Limitations\n\nBefore we dive into the popular methods of earning free Ethereum, it is essential to understand their risks and limitations.\n\nFirstly, earning free Ethereum does not mean you are making a passive income. It is more of a one-time reward for completing a task or participating in a program. Therefore, it would help if you did not consider it a means of earning a regular income.\n\nSecondly, there are always risks associated with cryptocurrency exchanges and blockchain networks. While some are legitimate and trustworthy, others may not be. It is essential to do your research and make informed investment decisions.\n\nLastly, some programs may require you to provide your email address or other personal information. It is crucial to read the terms and conditions and understand how your data will be used.\n\nPopular Methods to Earn Free Ethereum in 2023\n\nNow that we have discussed the risks and limitations let us move on to the popular methods of earning free Ethereum in 2023.\n\nWatch Videos\n\nMany blockchain networks and crypto exchanges offer free Ethereum for watching videos.

However, this time the Cardano founder is on the other side of criticism, targeted for his contributions to Ethereum.\n\nFabian Vogelsteller, an Ethereum co-founder, accused Hoskinson of building “literally nothing for Ethereum.” While the founder supposedly meant no harm, his words garnered quite a reaction on Twitter, even from Hoskinson himself.\n\nCharles Hoskinson Built Nothing?\n\nOn April 29, Fabian Vogelsteller stirred quite the controversy after tweeting a post about Ethereum Foundation members who built their blockchains. The post featured images of Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson, Polkadot Founder Gavin Woods, and Lukso Founder Fabian Vogelsteller with their net worths.\n\nThe post didn’t sit well with Vogelsteller, who took it upon himself to correct it. He suggested Charles Hoskinson should be removed from the picture because he was never really a founder of Ethereum and was just at the right place at the right time.\n\nTo correct this picture a little bit:@VitalikButerin is the ethereum founder, so he doesn’t count. @IOHK_Charles was never really a founder of ethereum. He built literally nothing for ethereum that I am aware of. He was just early on at the right place, at the time, hanging… https://t.co/zHFV4zLANR — Fabian Vogelsteller (@feindura) April 29, 2023\n\nWhile Vogelsteller clarified he meant no offense with his words, he buttressed that he had been involved in Ethereum long before it was formed and knows very well who contributed what and when.\n\nIn response to Vogelsteller’s accusations, many on Crypto Twitter quickly came to Hoskinson’s defense, flooding his post with memes and replies. Some took jabs at the Lukso founder, and others shared proof of the Cardano Founder donning an Ethereum shirt and spreading the word.\n\nAfter things got out of hand, Hoskinson chimed in with his casual sarcasm.\n\nThanks Fabian. Glad to get your opinion on my worth and contributions. I suppose Switzerland just materialized out of the ether. Also given my profound incompetence, I'd love to meet the people behind Cardano. Pretty cool project to just somehow self manifest — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) April 30, 2023\n\nThe Cardano founder sarcastically thanked Vogelsteller for his comments while hinting at Switzerland and Cardano. Notably, Hoskinson registered the Ethereum Foundation in Switzerland and served as CEO before leaving to build IOG and Cardano in 2015 and 2017, respectively.\n\nThe rowdy founder left Ethereum when his vision did not align with Buterin.\n\nSoon after Hoskinson’s reply, Vogelsteller again explained he meant no offense to the Cardano Founder’s work or skills. Instead, he meant Hoskinson did nothing based purely on code contributions. He added he didn’t plan to instigate blockchain drama.\n\nTo which the Cardano founder has yet to respond.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nIn March, Hoskinson shared that Crypto Twitter and cryptocurrency media content spread FUD instead of constructive information.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nCardano Founder Charles Hoskinson is one of the most influential figures in the Crypto community. Controversies related to the rowdy founder often reach a considerable audience. Vogelstellar could likely be using the controversy as a marketing ploy to generate interest in his project, Lukso.\n\nFAQs\n\nDid Charles Hoskinson work on Ethereum? Charles Hoskinson joined Ethereum in 2013 as one of the five founders with Vitalik Buterin, Gavin Wood, Anthony Di Iorio, Amir Chetrit, and Jeffrey Wilcke. He served as the CEO for a short period, after which he left in 2014. When did Charles Hoskinson leave Ethereum? Charles Hoskinson left Ethereum in 2014 over a dispute with Vitalik Buterin on whether the project should be for-profit or non-profit. Hoskinson believed Ethereum should take the commercial route and become like Google, whereas Buterin believed the project should be modeled after Mozilla, a non-profit organization. Hoskinson went on to form IOHK and Cardano. Will Cardano ever replace Ethereum? Ethereum is a long-established network and powers a wide range of Layer-2 products, giving it the second-largest market capitalization of $227 billion. In contrast, Cardano has taken an intentionally slow, dev-focused approach to its blockchain. Despite being heralded for its consistency, the project has drawn scrutiny for falling behind, which is evident in the poor growth of its market cap. At $13 billion, Cardano has a long way to go in replacing Ethereum. What is Charles Hoskinson saying about Cardano? Charles Hoskinson believes Cardano still has a lot of building to do and is about 85% complete. He explains that many delays and issues surrounding Cardano can be attributed ..."}]

This differs from other AMM designs, where assets are swapped at the price determined by the AMM curve.\n\nWhen the price of the collateral is higher, all of the user’s deposits will be in the deposited collateral, but as the price of the collateral goes lower, the oracle will convert the deposits to crvUSD.\n\nCurve deployed its initial crvUSD smart contracts yesterday, but a minor issue where fees were not flowing to the project’s DAO was noted by its team, Blockworks Research Senior Analyst Dan Smith said.\n\nThis protocol resolved this minor issue after Curve Finance redeployed an updated smart contract this morning.\n\nEven though information on Etherscan shows that Curve minted an initial 20 million crvUSD, Smith notes that this was part of the deployment process and the tokens themselves did not leave the system.\n\n“crvUSD only becomes circulating after it has been borrowed by an end user,” he said.\n\nAt the time of writing, Michael Egorov, the founder and CEO of Curve Finance, has the only open loan of $1.05 million.\n\nThe final step, Smith noted, will be to push the user interface onto the Curve website.\n\n“With two major releases during the depths of the bear market (crvUSD and upgraded tri crypto contracts), Curve is well positioned for success when liquidity and volume returns,” Smith said.\n\n“Curve now controls multiple parts of [the] DeFi stack with a DEX, lending market, and stablecoin.”\n\nTo learn more about Curve Finance and its Q1 performance, check out this detailed report by Blockworks Research.\n\nDon’t miss the next big story – join our free daily newsletter.'}, {'id': 3, 'time': 'Thu, 04 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'How to Unwrap Ethereum? - Watcher Guru', 'content': 'The Ethereum network has made the switch from proof-of-work mining to proof-of-stake mining. The transition was completed successfully on September 15, 2022. Additionally, the blockchain went through some major changes as the miners were replaced by validators.\n\nRecently, the much-awaited Shapella upgrade went live, allowing these stakers to withdraw their staked ETH. However, ETH is the second-largest cryptocurrency and was created way back before the emergence of dApps.\n\nAlso read: How To Change Slippage Tolerance on PancakeSwap?\n\nThen the real question emerges as to what it is and why it exists. Wrapped Ether was created to give Ethereum-based decentralized applications (dApps) a more standardized approach to interface with Ether, the network’s native coin.\n\nWhat is Wrapped Ethereum (wETH)?\n\nwETH is just Ether wrapped in a smart contract to provide it with a standardized ERC-20 interface, allowing it to be exchanged and utilized within decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and other Ethereum-based services.\n\nGiven that Ether lacked the most widely used standard for tokens, the ERC-20 interface, it was necessary to create wETH. The process of wrapping ether includes moving the ETH to a smart contract. wETH will then be generated in return for this process. Additionally, this is to ensure that there is a reserve backing every wETH.\n\nAlso read: Is MetaMask Safe (2023)?\n\nBefore we look into how to unwrap Ethereum, let us look at how we can wrap it in just a few simple steps.\n\nHow to wrap Ether?\n\nThere are different ways to wrap Ethereum. One method involves the swapping of ETH for wETH through a cryptocurrency exchange. Another common method is the use of a smart contract. Let us look at the step-by-step guide on how to wrap ETH using OpenSea and MetaMask.\n\nGo to OpenSea and connect your MetaMask wallet.\n\nClick on the “Wallet” option. You will see three dots in the top-right corner. Click on the three dots next to Ethereum.\n\nClick on “Wrap” from the drop-down menu.\n\nEnter the amount and click on “Wrap ETH.”\n\nOnce it is done, confirm the MetaMask pop-up for the transaction to be complete.\n\nThat’s it. You will receive wETH which will shine brightly in pink.\n\nNow that we have covered how to wrap Ether, let us look at how to unwrap Ether using MetaMask and OpenSea.\n\nAlso read: How to Buy Crypto with Western Union\n\nHow to unwrap Ethereum?\n\nUnwrapping Ethereum is also a straightforward process. It works similarly to how you convert ETH to wETH. Let us look at the steps below.'}, {'id': 6, 'time': 'Thu, 04 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum [ETH]: Decoding the possibility of a price correction as failed transactions surge - AMBCrypto News', 'content': 'The total number of failed Ethereum transactions exceeded 500,000.\n\nETH’s price craters as network activity experienced a dip.\n\nAccording to data from CryptoQuant, there was a significant surge in the total number of failed Ethereum[ETH] transactions, reaching over 500,000 as of 2 May.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nTaking a cue from ETH’s historical performance, pseudonymous CryptoQuant Analyst MACD, found an interesting fact. Whenever the total count of failed ETH transactions exceeded 200,000, it indicated “market overheating” and was often followed by price corrections.\n\n“In the past, when Ethereum’s transaction failures rise above 200,000, it shows a market overheating and has often seen a price correction.”\n\nTo brace for a price correction or not?\n\nIn the last month, ETH’s price oscillated between $2100 and $1800. At press time, the leading altcoin exchanged hands at $1,869, with a 2% price rally within the past 24 hours, data from CoinMarketCap showed.\n\nOn-chain assessment of ETH’s performance revealed a decline in network activity since 14 April. According to Santiment, the count of daily active addresses that have since traded the alt fell by 41%.\n\nAdditionally, the number of new addresses created daily on the ETH network has plummeted as well. Information from the on-chain data provider revealed the creation of 12,492 new addresses on the ETH network on 1 May. This represented an 86% drop from the 91,560 new addresses created on 14 April.\n\nWith the continued decline in the count of new and active addresses trading ETH, the coin’s value fell from $2100 on 14 April to $1,869 at press time.\n\nIn addition to a fall in its network activity, ETH’s funding rates fell to a one-month low of -0.013 on 3 May. When a crypto asset records negative funding rates, it means that most traders in the market are taking short positions or betting against the asset.\n\nAs a result, it is often taken as an indicator of bearish sentiment and sometimes precipitates a decline in an asset’s value.\n\nFurthermore, as ETH’s price fell since mid-April, holders of 1000 to 100,000 ETH coins gradually distributed their ETH holdings, contributing to the decline in value, per data from Santiment.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nInterestingly, bigger whales, that hold between 100,000 to 10,000,000 ETH coins, increased their holdings during the same period. However, with bearish sentiments still lingering in the market, this has failed to result in any significant price rally.\n\nAt press time, ETH’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) were positioned beneath their respective neutral spots, in downtrend positions. This indicated waning buying pressure and highlighted the need for new demand to drive up the alt’s value.'}, {'id': 30, 'time': 'Thu, 04 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Crypto Price Today: Bitcoin rises above $29k; Ethereum, Polygon surge up to 3% - The Economic Times', 'content': '\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cryptocurrency markets were trading higher in Thursday\'s trade after the US Fed raised its benchmark lending rate by 25 bps again to cool inflation. Bitcoin (BTC) rose 2.44% to $29,152, whereas Ethereum (ETH) was above the $1,900 level.

At present, Bitcoin is being traded at the US$29,000 level and is gradually approaching its resistance levels of US$29,420 and US$30,000," Edul Patel, Co-founder and CEO at Mudrex, said.“As the upcoming US employment figures are scheduled to be released on Friday, investors and traders are keeping a watchful eye on them,” Edul added.The global cryptocurrency market cap was trading higher around $1.20 trillion, rising 2% in the last 24 hours.The total volume in DeFi is currently 3,45 billion, 8.04% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume.

And that was a convenient way to label it. But that wasn’t the reason they were moved.”\n\nLubin’s referring to Ethereum’s infamous “Red Wedding” in 2014 when the eight co-founders and the team gathered to incorporate Ethereum as a company.\n\nFormer Ethereum CEO Charles Hoskinson (right) with creator Vitalik Buterin (left) from back in the day. (Flickr)\n\nThe meeting descended into bickering and infighting over internal politics that saw a devastated CEO Charles Hoskinson pushed out of the team, along with underperforming co-founder Amir Chetrit.\n\n“I think it’s true that I and several people on the team — like maybe everybody else — believed that you need to draw businesses in, you needed economic, commercial validation in order to build better things, even open-source software,” the 58-year-old says in his slow, measured tones.\n\n\n\n“But that wasn’t the root of why I started ConsenSys or why two people were bumped off the project.”\n\nRed Wedding and Crypto Google\n\nAs documented in Camilla Russo’s history of Ethereum, The Infinite Machine, the co-founders had gathered in Zug, Switzerland on June 7, 2014, to sign a document transforming Ethereum into a for-profit company. But instead of signing the contract, tensions boiled over Hoskinson’s management style and personality, Chetrit’s contribution to the project, Ethereum’s future direction and other internal political issues.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter much back and forth, the decisions were all left to the gangly 20-year-old math genius who’d created the project in the first place. After some time alone on the terrace, he returned to say Hoskinson and Chetrit were out, and Ethereum would become a nonprofit foundation instead of a company.\n\n\n\n“Vitalik wrote an amazing white paper — it was right place, right time, incredible vision — and it attracted lots of people of disparate backgrounds, and we worked together well for chunks of time,” Lubin says by way of context.\n\nJoe Lubin in conversation with Magazine in Tel Aviv.\n\n“We had differences of opinion, at times, those differences of opinion boiled over famously… infamously. And there was a moment where two people were bumped out of leadership, and up to that point, we were having discussions about whether we were going to be purely nonprofit, or whether we were going to pursue a nonprofit track, put it under a foundation, and then the same group of people who worked so nicely together would build Crypto Google together.\n\n“And it became apparent to all of us that we probably weren’t going to build Crypto Google. But it was also clear to all of us that nobody was even close to being able to build Crypto Google and that we’re just building the foundation and the platform for a long time.”\n\nLubin was already planning his own for-profit company to build out Ethereum’s application layer when the decision was made, and it spun into life not long afterward.\n\nWhile other co-founders, such as Gavin Wood (Polkadot), contributed more to the early protocol itself, arguably none of them, apart from Buterin, has since contributed as much as Lubin to what Ethereum is today. While ConsenSys didn’t turn into Crypto Google, its infrastructure and apps are as important to Ethereum now as Google is to the web.\n\n“ConsenSys wasn’t formed to commercialize it. It was formed to continue the vision and the mission of the Ethereum platform,” Lubin explains.\n\n\n\nRelated: The Vitalik I know — Dmitry Buterin\n\nWho is Joe Lubin?\n\nBorn in Toronto in 1964, Lubin studied electrical engineering and computer science at Princeton in the mid-1980s, where his roommate was another future crypto billionaire, Mike Novogratz of Galaxy Digital. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos was in the same faculty, though Lubin tells Magazine they never met.\n\nJoe Lubin was almost 50 before he jumped on board the Ethereum train and made his first billion.\n\nLubin has had a surprisingly diverse career, working in AI, robotics and autonomous music creation for a number of different employers. He founded a hedge fund and was the vice president of private wealth management at Goldman Sachs, but nothing world-changing, according to Novogratz, as quoted in the Financial Times in 2021.\n\n“Joe was one of the brightest among us, a forward thinker, but by 45 hadn’t done anything to stand ou...'}]

Similar frenzied activity has been seen other smaller coins. For instance, CHAD and 4TOKEN have rallied 450% and 250% in one week, while DINO has risen 500% in two weeks.'}, {'id': 5, 'time': 'Fri, 05 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Ethereum Developers Outline Plans for 'Dencun' Network Upgrade - Unchained - Unchained", 'content': 'The core feature of the Dencun upgrade is EIP-4844, or Proto-Danksharding, which will make Layer 2 transactions significantly cheaper.\n\nDencun will be the next major network upgrade after Shapella, and has the potential to lower transaction costs on Ethereum.\n\nIn a blog post published this week, Ethereum core developer Tim Beiko revealed the next set of major Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP) that have been tentatively included in the Dencun upgrade.\n\nDencun, a term coined by a combination of the star Deneb and Mexican city Cancun, follows a similar naming convention to Shapella, which was named after the Chinese city Shanghai and northern-constellation star Capella.\n\nThe upgrade will focus on bringing improvements and changes to Ethereum’s execution layer through four EIPs that have been decided upon so far. Just like most of the attention in the Shapella upgrade was centered around EIP-4895, which enabled validator withdrawals from the Beacon Chain, the focus of this upgrade will likely be EIP-4844, otherwise known as “Proto-Danksharding” or “The Surge.”\n\nThis EIP will introduce temporary “data blobs” to the Ethereum network, which Layer 2 networks can use to post the transaction/proof data currently stored elsewhere. The fact that blobs are store ephemerally means that gas costs will be significantly lower, which will lead to much cheaper Layer 2 transactions, explained Beiko.\n\n“While not quite as big as The Merge, EIP-4844 is a significant change to Ethereum: it introduces a whole new data layer to the network, which both the current consensus and execution layers must interact with,” he said.\n\nIntroducing EIP-4844 will also mean there is less room for other changes to the network, but developers have still included three other EIPs alongside it. These include EIP-1153, which improves blockspace availability, EIP-6475, that makes transaction formats forward-compatible, and EIP-6780, which deactivates the code used to terminate a smart contract.\n\nBeiko did not specify when this upgrade would be deployed, but said that the next update on Dencun’s finalized scope would likely be the first testnet fork announcement.'}, {'id': 4, 'time': 'Fri, 05 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'DCG’s Barry Silbert Sells $755K Worth of Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust Shares - Decrypt', 'content': 'Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBarry Silbert, the founder and CEO of Digital Currency Group (DCG), has sold some of his Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust (ETCG) shares, according to a recent SEC filing.\n\nDCG is one of the largest crypto conglomerates on the market and counts Grayscale Investments, the trust’s issuer, as one of its subsidiaries.\n\nAccording to the filing, Silbert has moved to liquidate nearly 120,000 ETCG shares, worth an aggregate market value of approximately $755,295 dollars. This also appears to be the first time Silbert has sold any of his ETCG shares, according to SEC filings.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe ETCG fund, which launched in 2017, allows investors to gain exposure to Ethereum Classic (ETC) through a brokerage account. ETC and Ethereum (ETH) used to be the same thing until 2016, when developers implemented a hard fork of the network to return millions worth of stolen funds to investors after a hack. The fork was notably backed by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.\n\nThe ETCG sale represents a small portion of the fund’s $225 million assets under management and 14 million outstanding shares—of which Silbert is a 10% shareholder. He’s also listed as one of the fund’s directors.\n\nThe sale was brokered by New York-based firm Cannacord Genuity on April 28 on the OTCQX, the highest tier of over-the-counter (OTC) market for trading securities, according to the SEC filing.\n\nSilbert’s shares were originally purchased during two privately negotiated transactions over the 2017-2018 period. So far, he hasn’t made any official comments on the recent transaction.\n\nIt’s a somewhat surprising development to see the crypto permabull selling his ETCG shares. Silbert has been in the crosshairs over the past months, due to a $630 million dollar debt DCG-owned lending desk Genesis owes to Gemini, a crypto exchange and custodian owned by the Winklevoss twins.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEarlier this week, the companies announced they had entered into a 30-day mediation process to settle the outstanding loan balance. “If DCG is unable to pay and/or restructure its debt, DCG risks defaulting on its obligations,” Gemini said in a statement.'}, {'id': 12, 'time': 'Fri, 05 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'PEPE Meme Coin Hysteria Pushes Ethereum Gas Fees to 1-Year High - Yahoo Finance', 'content': "Ethereum’s gas fees have surged above a one-year high as the demand for trading the PEPE meme coin continues to soar.\n\nThe average cost of a single transaction on Ethereum jumped above $15.82 on May 4.\n\nWhile Ethereum’s mean transaction fees have reached much higher levels of between $50 to $70 in 2021, things have been quiet since the market crashed in May 2022.\n\nDaily median gas price. Source: Etherscan .\n\nIt’s likely that excitement around meme coins, specifically the newly-launched PEPE, is responsible for the revival in gas fees.\n\nIn the last 24 hours, the trading volume for PEPE surpassed $150 million on Uniswap, higher than Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) and USDT stablecoin volumes.\n\nThe PEPE token also entered the top 100 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization on May 1, obtaining a valuation of over $500 million. The token has continued to surge since then, last trading at a market value of $879 million.\n\nFollowing the success of PEPE coin, numerous copycats have also emerged representing different internet memes.\n\nData from crypto analytics firm Nansen shows that the most active smart contracts on Ethereum are currently Uniswap trading pools for meme coins such as SPONGE, TURBO, BOB, and TRBNR.\n\nMost used DeFi contracts on Ethereum on May 5, 2023. Source: Nansen\n\nThe increased gas fees witnessed 9,392 in ETH burned over the last 24 hours, at par with one-year high levels.\n\nEthereum executed a hard fork in 2021 which meant that a portion of all Ethereum transactions were destroyed. Thus, as activity increases on the network, more ETH is destroyed.\n\nThe rise in Ethereum’s transaction fees has led to a rise in gas fees for Layer-2 transactions as well.\n\nAre Ethereum scaling solutions helping?\n\nThe gas fees for layer-2 transactions have also surged with mainnet fees as related data for layer-2 transactions are also posted in layer-1 blocks for security.\n\nThere are two kinds of layer-2 scaling solutions: zero-knowledge proofs and optimistic. Both use another technology called rollups, which batch transactions off of the mainnet into a single, smaller transaction before settling on the mainnet.\n\nStory continues\n\nNotably, zero-knowledge proof (ZK)-based rollups were hit relatively worse than optimistic rollups. The fees for swapping tokens on ZK-based scaling solutions like Polygon zkEVM, Starknet, and zkSync Era mainnet surged between $2 to $11.\n\nA zkSync Discord community member noted they had to pay $11 swap ETH to USDC, noting in amazement that “Is it gonna cost that much?”\n\nAnother user complained about $30 in fees for DeFi deposits on zkSync.\n\n$30 gas fee on Layer 2 $ZKS $ZKSYNC @zksync\n\nI don't understand, I thought layer 2 were made to reduce gas fees 😱😱 pic.twitter.com/Uz6k5p4bC5 — Kool Crypto ⚙️🛸 (@healthymofin) May 5, 2023\n\nAccording to L2 Fees data, the gas fees for sending ETH on Arbitrum One and Optimism, both of which are Optimistic rollup solutions, are between $0.2 to $0.6 for swap tokens, which is around ten times higher than the mean value."}, {'id': 7, 'time': 'Fri, 05 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "How Cardano's Hydra Layer-2 Is Challenging Bitcoin Lightning Network and Ethereum Sharding - DailyCoin", 'content': 'Cardano released its Layer-2 scalability solution, Hydra.\n\nHydra introduces a novel scaling solution that challenges Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others.\n\nAccording to Charles Hoskinson, Cardano’s new solution could make it the fastest, most scalable network.\n\nCardano has long been vying for a spot among the top cryptocurrency projects. Now, with its scalability solution Hydra up and running, it has solidified its position as a major player in the industry, standing alongside its more established peers, Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nHydra, the Layer-2 solution from the Proof of Stake (POS) Chain, is one of the most highly anticipated upgrades. Now that it is here, people are excited to see it deliver Cardano’s promise of being the fastest and most scalable payment network in the world, challenging the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nWhat Is Hydra?\n\nThe Hydra Head Protocol or Hydra is Cardano’s open-source Layer-2 scalability solution that, according to Charles Hoskinson, would make Cardano the fastest payment network in the world.\n\nAnnounced in September 2019, after much anticipation, delays, and hurdles, Hydra finally made it to the Cardano main chain in May 2023, thanks to engineers from the Cardano Foundation and IOHK.\n\nHydra is an isomorphic scaling solution. This means it replicates Cardano’s functionality and security guarantees on an off-chain ledger network while maintaining communication between the two layers.\n\nCardano Hydra use case. Source: Hydra Head Protocol.\n\nIt operates almost similarly to state-channel solutions such as Bitcoin’s Lightning Network and Ethereum’s Raiden Network. Users can securely and instantly perform transactions on their private networks, in this case, Hydra heads, and settle the result on the main chain, enabling faster and cheaper transactions while keeping the integrity and security of the network.\n\nWhat’s unique about Hydra is that off-chain ledgers through Head nodes can act as special dApps for developers who look to scale their apps. With Hydra, developers can independently run on-chain scripts or software stack on their private nodes and securely publish the result on the main chain instantly and at a low price.\n\nHydra brings a solid solution, allowing Cardano to compete with Ethereum and Bitcoin.\n\nIn Contrast with Other Scalability Solutions\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Ethereum have long established themselves in the cryptocurrency world, with the latter powering a myriad of Layer-2 protocols. Additionally, Ethereum’s sharding and Bitcoin’s lightning network are some of the best solutions in the space, earning the networks a collective market cap of $807 billion.\n\nAlthough Cardano is often compared with Bitcoin and Ethereum, its string of delays and issues drew much criticism from the community, leading to slow growth evident with its $13 billion market cap. However, with Hydra in the mix, it can finally sit at the table with its solution.\n\nEthereum, Cardano, and Bitcoin Compared\n\nWhile Ethereum Sharding, Bitcoin Lightning Network, and Cardano’s Hydra solution may come from the same family or operate similarly, comparing or saying one is better wouldn’t be fair. Each scalability solution has its pros and cons and addresses different challenges.\n\nSharding is a Layer-1 solution that focuses on increasing the network’s capacity and increasing the overall transaction throughput of the network. It breaks the blockchain into shards that process transactions parallel to the main chain.\n\nHowever, according to Charles Hoskinson, Sharding is “very complex.” Because of this complexity, network security and performance drastically defer because it operates on the main chain. Additionally, it requires a lot of resources and can be expensive to implement.\n\nHydra, on the other hand, creates an independent off-chain ledger network that replicates the security and functionality of the Cardano chain, allowing it to maintain both security and performance without congesting the main chain. It doesn’t rely on soft or hard forks, making it inexpensive and straightforward to implement.\n\nConversely, Bitcoin Lightning Network is a Layer-2 solution on top of Bitcoin, which uses bi-directional off-chain payment channels between users, enabling fast, cheap, and scalable transactions.\n\nHowever, because it uses payment channels, it only supports asset transfer, unlike Hydra, which allows developers to run scripts and elaborate transactions instantly off-chain as it would on the main chain.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nAn Ethereum founder accused Cardano Founder of contributing nothing to Ethereum.\n\nMany competitors called Cardano’s EUTXO design a security flaw; Hoskin replied that the model made it more secure.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nCardano’s Hydra solution brings competition to the space. The better the competition, the better the solutions, leading to greater adoption. Cardano’s new protocol could significantly elevate the network’s status in the cryptocurrency industry and attract more developers to build apps on the netwo...'}]

Major Euro Football Club Now Accepts Bitcoin & Ethereum - CCN.com', 'content': 'By CCN.com: The beautiful game just got much prettier after European football giant Benfica announced they’d be accepting bitcoin and Ethereum payments. Now, fans of the Portuguese Primera Liga champions can pay for match tickets and club merchandise using cryptocurrency.\n\nEuro Elite Benfica Accept Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nThis isn’t the first time the footballing elite has flirted with cryptocurrency, but it is the first time its been accepted as regular payment.\n\nIn the recent past, Italian champions Juventus played around with the idea of launching its own club token. Football supporters were even able to pay for match access with bitcoin during 2018’s World Cup in Russia – although that was a one-off.\n\nNow the transactional value of cryptocurrency can be employed in full around the Estádio da Luz – Benfica’s home ground. The sudden move comes courtesy of UTRUST, a crypto payments processing firm which also utilizes its own ETH-based token, UTK.\n\nAccording to Wednesday’s press release:\n\n“UTRUST’s core technology will allow Benfica to take advantage of the increased security and convenience of cryptocurrency payments while protecting the club from market volatility. It will also significantly reduce processing fees and eliminate inconvenient credit-card chargebacks and fraudulent payments.”\n\nBenfica CEO Domingos Soares de Oliveira said the decision to accept crypto payments came from a recognition that the club must “stay ahead of the curve,” adding:\n\n“[We] recognize that many of our supporters are now digital users first so we want to be ahead of the curve when it comes to accepting novel technologies.”\n\nFootball in Bed With Cryptocurrency?\n\nIt would have been difficult to imagine a more unlikely bedfellow for bitcoin than football, but no other popular industry has embraced crypto anywhere near as much.\n\nFormer Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp once pumped a cryptocurrency via his Twitter account. Footballing legend Ronaldinho even launched his own token. More names familiar to British and European football fans round up this list, which is growing by the month.\n\nIndeed, as recently as April, controversial cryptocurrency Bitcoin SV (BSV) signed a sponsorship deal with Scottish club Ayr United. The small seaside club carries the nickname of ‘The Honest Men.’ Make of that tidbit what you will.\n\nBenfica has a long, glorious history in European football and regularly fills out its 65,000 capacity stadium weekly. The club boasts 14 million followers worldwide and 7 million active fans across the internet and social media accounts.\n\nOnly bitcoin, Ethereum, and UTRUST’s UTK token will be accepted for payments to start.'}, {'id': 7, 'time': 'Sat, 06 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum [ETH]: Dipping prices, rising negative sentiments and everything in between - AMBCrypto News', 'content': 'Ethereum Proof-of-Stake network experienced a drop in active validator count since the Shapella upgrade.\n\nETH’s value has since posted a double-digit decline.\n\nSince Ethereum’s [ETH] Shapella upgrade went live on 12 April, there has been a steep decline in active validator count on the proof-of-stake (POS) network, data from Glassnode revealed.\n\nRead Ethereum’s Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nInformation obtained from the on-chain data provider put the active validator count on the network at 562,941 on 12 April. Just 24 hours after the Shanghai upgrade went live, this fell to 561,655, where it has since remained.\n\nObserved on a 30-day moving average, the total number of validators that voluntarily exited Ethereum’s validator pool since Shapella rose significantly by over 400%.\n\nThe continued decline in active validator count on the Ethereum POS network is due to a rally in the withdrawals of previously deposited ETH coins by some validators on the network.\n\nFollowing the Shapella upgrade, validators that had previously secured the network with more than 18 million ETH were free to initiate withdrawals, which some of them did. According to a Nansen dashboard, 10,675 validators were scheduled for full exit in the last hour at press time.\n\nETH prices take a plunge\n\nMany expected ETH’s value to dip significantly once Shapella went live due to increased withdrawals and sell-offs to make a profit by those who had initially staked their ETH coins. In contrast, the alt’s value rose momentarily after the upgrade.\n\nAccording to data from CoinMarketCap, ETH’s price jumped by 14% between 12 and 16 April. As of 16 April, the leading altcoin traded above $2000, after which the price descent began. Exchanging hands at $1,897.75 at press time, ETH’s price has since decreased by 11%.\n\nDespite the price fall, ETH whales that hold between 100,000 to 10,000,000 ETH coins have intensified accumulation. Per data from Santiment, since the Shapella, the count of these big whales increased by 2.5%.\n\nConversely, whales that hold between 1,000 and 100,000 ETH coins have taken a risk-averse approach and dumped some of their ETH holdings. Data from Santiment revealed that their number has gone down by 1% since Shapella.\n\nRealistic or not, here’s ETH’s market cap in BTC terms\n\nFurther, while the ephemeral jump in ETH’s value following the Shapella upgrade caused market sentiment to turn positive on 14 April, the price decline caused the alt’s weighted sentiment to return to negative territory, where it has since remained.\n\nAt press time, this was -1.172. With persistent negative sentiment lingering in the market, any significant spike in ETH’s price might be hard to come by.'}, {'id': 5, 'time': 'Sat, 06 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Vitalik Buterin and ETH Foundation Sell $30 Million in Ethereum As ETH About to Break $2,000 - U.Today', 'content': 'Disclaimer: The opinions expressed by our writers are their own and do not represent the views of U.Today.

Santiment on-chain data company believes that ETH is on the cusp of breaking above $2,000.\n\nButerin and ETH Foundation sell ETH\n\nLookonchain shared that the vitalik.eth wallet was the first to move 200 Ethereum (worth about $400,000) to the U.S.-based Kraken exchange. Following Buterin\'s transaction, the Ethereum Foundation did the same but on a much bigger scale — they shifted 15,000 ETH to Kraken as well.\n\nTogether with Buterin\'s crypto, that makes $40,000,000 USD in fiat. The second transaction was also noticed and highlighted by the popular crypto tracker Whale Alert.\n\nIt seems that Buterin just sells Ethereum from time to time in more or less the same amounts. As reported by U.Today earlier, in the middle of February, he sold 210 ETH for roughly $325,000 in the USDC stablecoin. Curiously, that chunk of ETH was also sold on Kraken.\n\nBack then, Ethereum was trading at $1,545.\n\nOn March 13, he moved another 200 ETH to Kraken, selling it at the price of $1,656 per coin.\n\nEthereum on verge of breaking $2,000: Reasons\n\nSantiment data aggregator reported on Friday that ETH had reached an eight-month high in flows to crypto exchanges. The analytics team believes that this may be a sign of an upcoming volatility increase similar to what it was like after the collapse of FTX in early November and the Merge in mid-September.\n\nIn a tweet that followed, Santiment added that while "sky-high active deposits" of ETH to exchanges are the highest since November last year, ETH is now showing signs of decoupling from BTC and may be about to break above the $2,000 level.\n\n🚀 Updating our report on #Ethereum\'s sky-high active deposits, exchange addresses interacting on the network is now at its highest level since November, 2021.

That was down to the meme coin season unwrapping at the moment — the majority of meme coins run on Ethereum and so are being actively moved with high ETH fees, providing a great opportunity to burn ETH and decrease the circulating supply.'}]

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
The recent news articles suggest a mixed sentiment in the Ethereum (ETH) market. On one hand, there are concerns about large amounts of ETH being sold by Vitalik Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation, potentially leading to a price drop as seen in historical data. Additionally, there is a decrease in active validator count on the Ethereum Proof-of-Stake network post-Shapella upgrade, contributing to negative market sentiment. However, there are positive indicators such as long-term holders accumulating ETH, the potential for ETH to break above $2,000, and increased trading volume, indicating trader interest. Overall, the market trend for ETH appears uncertain with a possibility of price fluctuations in the near term.

That further shows traders’ calm amid the Ethereum Foundation transfer.\n\nNotably, the 50-day EMA has capped Ether's downside attempts so far in 2023, barring the early March selloff that saw the price briefly falling below the red wave. Meanwhile, testing it as support has prompted the ETH price to pursue a breakout above $2,000.\n\nAs a result of this support, ETH bulls may attempt to take the price above $2,000 again.\n\nConversely, a drop below the 50-day EMA could have traders eye a support confluence comprising a multi-month ascending trendline and the 200-day EMA (the blue wave) near $1,700 as the next downside target, down about 13% from current price levels.\n\nEven with a larger decline, ETH would be maintaining its overall recovery trend when measured from its June 2022 bottom of $880.\n\nEthereum exchange reserves vs. Kraken reserves\n\nA rising exchange balance suggests potential selling pressure rising and vice versa. In Ethereum’s case, the balance remained lower across all the exchanges despite the Ethereum Foundation’s transferring $30 million into Kraken.\n\nFor instance, Kraken's Ether balance increased to 1.84 million ETH on May 6, from 1.83 million one day earlier.\n\nEther Kraken balance vs. exchange balance. Source: Glassnode\n\nNevertheless, the balance across all exchanges actually dropped to 18.15 million ETH from 18.22 million ETH on the day, indicating that any potential sell-pressure from the Ethereum Foundation can easily be absorbed.\n\nNot necessarily a ETH market top\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation’s last big transfer was 20,000 ETH in November 2021, when the price topped around $4,850, declining 80% thereafter. Similarly, the foundation sold 35,053 ETH at the local market top of around $3,500 in May 2021.\n\nRelated: Ethereum up 20% in April while Markets Pro sees 379% gain in one day\n\nMany analysts treated these fractals as a sign of another possible market top formation near $2,000, arguing that the price may fall in the coming sessions.\n\nEthereum Foundation sold another 20,000 Ethereum at the recent local top.\n\n\n\nEvery time the eth foundation / Vitalik / Consensys dumps a massive presale bag it marks the top.\n\n\n\nWhat’s the difference between ripple dumping hundreds of millions on retail vs ETH founders doing it? https://t.co/pw8ukMiR8v — Brad Mills ⚡️ (@bradmillscan) January 28, 2022\n\nBut broader data suggests otherwise. For instance, Ethereum Foundation’s large ETH sales occurred also during the 2020-2021 bull cycle, boosted by growing demand for risk-on assets in a lower interest rate macro environment.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation's large ETH transfers to exchanges since 2018. Source: Wu Blockchain\n\nIn other words, there’s little evidence to suggest that the Ethereum Foundation’s sales have any impact on Ethereum’s price trend.

Since the start of the year it is up more than 50%, and yet it is still down more than 60% from its all-time high of almost $4,900.\n\nBecause of its hot start in 2023, it can be difficult to gauge whether Ethereum is a buy or a sell today. To get an answer to this question we need to do a little digging to find data from Ethereum's network that provides some historical context on its current position in the market.\n\nThe foundation for The Merge\n\nOne of the most important developments to come out of the cryptocurrency industry recently was The Merge, an upgrade that switched Ethereum from the clunky and energy-consuming proof-of-work method of verifying transactions to the more robust and energy-efficient proof-of-stake method.\n\nHowever, although The Merge dominated headlines, there is a lesser-known upgrade that is likely more meaningful for Ethereum's price than it is given credit for.\n\nKnown as the London hard fork, this upgrade was introduced in August 2021 and included a new pricing mechanism with a fixed base fee to be burned, or permanently destroyed. Essentially, the more transactions that occur on the network, the greater the number of ether tokens that could be removed from the supply. Because the fixed base fee is permanently removed from circulation, under some circumstances the total number of ether in circulation can actually decrease.\n\nData by TradingView\n\nBecause of the London hard fork Ethereum has effectively become a deflationary asset, as the chart above shows. It can be a little difficult to see, but around the end of 2022 the line showing the total supply of ether starts to bend. It was around this time that the number of transactions on the network started to increase, causing the burn mechanism to truly start to become evident.\n\nThanks to this new feature, Ethereum's price is now highly correlated to the dynamics of supply and demand. Before the London hard fork, Ethereum had a relatively high inflation rate, but now this has all changed and it could mean great things for Ethereum's price, especially if a bull market is on the horizon.\n\nContinued growth of active users\n\nThere is another metric we can look at to get a better idea of Ethereum's current valuation versus its potential future price. It's relatively simple, but evaluation of the number of active addresses on the Ethereum blockchain can provide a useful glimpse at activity on the network. Active addresses are the number of unique addresses that have either sent or received a transaction on the blockchain during a certain period, and the thinking goes that the greater the number of active addresses, the more demand for the cryptocurrency.\n\nData by TradingView\n\nWhen taking a look at these addresses, it becomes clear that while there has been a downtrend since the market peak in 2021, there has been substantial growth in recent months. It suggests that more people are using the blockchain for various purposes, such as making payments, creating decentralized applications, and executing smart contracts. As the number of users on the Ethereum network increases, so does the amount of ether burned, thus adding more deflationary pressure.\n\nDue to the newness of the burn mechanism and recent trends in active addresses, it's more than likely that Ethereum's price has yet to realize the full potential of this combination. As such, Ethereum seems to be in a position that could benefit users for years to come.\n\nWhen considering Ethereum was able to hit an all-time high of almost $4,900 without any burn mechanism and while still operating on the former proof-of-work methodology, it's difficult to imagine what could be in store for its price as it begins to reap the rewards of its new deflationary features.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {'id': 3, 'time': 'Sun, 07 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Vitalik Buterin And Ethereum Foundation Selling ETH – Will Prices Fall? - NewsBTC', 'content': "Ethereum supporters are confident that prices will break the $2,000 level. However, recent moves by its founder, Vitalik Buterin, and the Ethereum Foundation, the team managing the smart contracting platform, raises concerns, especially from coin holders and traders, on whether the coin has what it needs to break above key resistance levels.\n\nETH Transfer Raises Concerns Among Investors\n\nOn May 5, a tracker, LookOnChain, noticed that Vitalik.eth, the domain associated with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, transferred 200 ETH, which is worth about $400,000 at current valuation, to Kraken, a cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nShortly after that, the Ethereum Foundation also made a much larger transfer, moving 15,000 ETH, worth about $30 million, to the same platform.\n\nThis has raised concerns among holders, who are worried that the dumping of such a large amount of ETH could further pressure prices.\n\nIt’s worth noting that ETH is currently down 13% from its April highs, and sliding.\n\nCoin holders, including those of ETH, typically send tokens from time to time. Even so, any transfer to a centralized exchange is interpreted as bearish. Vitalik Buterin might need funds to cover operating costs or even invest in projects. At this time, it is not known why he sells.\n\nIn the past, Buterin has sold ETH in batches without causing a significant price drop.\n\nDespite this development, some analysts, including Santiment, believe that ETH may be decoupling from Bitcoin, and that it might soon recover, breaking above $2,000.\n\nAccording to data from Santiment, a leading on-chain data company, there has been a significant increase in the amount of Ethereum being moved to crypto exchanges over the past few months.\n\n😮 #Ethereum's active deposits just hit an 8-month high. As we research the most likely cause, we can currently state that this likely will foreshadow upcoming increased $ETH volatility, similar to the result of spikes during the #merge & #FTX collapse. https://t.co/aBeHQudM52 pic.twitter.com/oHeypfUPvJ — Santiment (@santimentfeed) May 5, 2023\n\nEthereum Sees Increased Adoption\n\nDespite these concerns, there are also positive signs, based on on-chain activity.\n\nA record amount of ETH was burned at the end of this week, thanks to the meme coin craze, and specifically, PEPE. The majority of meme coins run on Ethereum and are being actively moved with higher gas fees, providing a great opportunity to burn ETH and decrease the circulating supply.\n\n31.7K $ETH has been burned in the past seven days. To put that in perspective, since the merge (231 days ago), 152K ETH total has been burned. That’s ~21% of the total burn in ~3% of the total days. This is the power of meme coins. pic.twitter.com/iFsZaDH5LU — K A L E O (@CryptoKaleo) May 5, 2023\n\nIn addition, Ethereum is seeing increased adoption from major companies and institutions, which is driving up demand for the cryptocurrency.\n\nLast week, the European Investment Bank (EIB) announced that it had issued its first-ever digital bond on the Ethereum blockchain, marking a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe increased adoption and burning of ETH due to the meme coin mania could sustain prices above key support levels in the days ahead. Still, it remains to be seen how prices will react in the days ahead.\n\nThe sharp drop on May 6, reversing gains of May 5, could anchor the next leg down, forcing even more liquidations towards the $1,500 support line.\n\n-Featured Image From Canva, Chart From TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nThe Ethereum (ETH) blockchain network is giving traders enormous concerns at this time as the incidence of skyrocketing gas fees appears to be returning. According to a shared insight from crypto analytics service provider WhaleAlert, one trader paid as much as 64 ETH worth approximately $118,600 at the time of writing in fees for a single transaction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n💸 A fee of 64 #ETH (119,121 USD) has just been paid for a single transaction!https://t.co/3w4UD0AZbw — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) May 8, 2023\n\nThe high gas fee is not a new thing on the Ethereum network; however, it is notably rare since the transition from the proof-of-work (PoW) protocol to proof-of-stake (PoS) through The Merge. While not an immediate dividend, the high gas fee was one of the major considerations for transitioning the protocol to PoS. The rationale is that a different transaction validation method can help in decongesting the network effectively.\n\nWith the high gas fees being recorded at the moment, the opposite appears to be the case. The cause may be linked to the massive meme coin hype that stirred intense network activity, causing a clog during the weekend.\n\nThis network activity reached a peak when Binance exchange listed PEPE tokens as well as Floki Inu for trading on its platform. This congestion, fueled in part by panic selling by whales and the accompanying soaring prices may reduce the gains accrued by these meme coins, especially for retail traders.\n\nPlace of Layer 2 solutions\n\nThe skyrocketing price of gas fees on Ethereum contributed to the birthing of innovative Layer 2 protocols like Polygon zkEVM, Arbitrum and Optimism. While the transaction fees on these protocols are a fraction of what it costs on the main Ethereum chain, users still bypass these L2s to carry out transactions on Ethereum.\n\nThe rationale for this remains unclear, but with innovative or community-focused protocols building on Ethereum mainnet, it generally becomes quite difficult for L2s to serve the purpose for which they are designed, lowering gas fees and championing scalability.'}, {'id': 12, 'time': 'Mon, 08 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': '3 Undervalued Cryptos to Buy On the Dip in May 2023 - Yahoo Finance', 'content': 'While cryptocurrencies can be alluring, investors should remain cautious in ensuring a safe and well-diversified portfolio.

Using optimistic rollups, a unique method, Arbitrum’s Layer-2 scaling solution promises to enhance the speed, scalability, and cost-effectiveness of Ethereum transactions.\n\nAltLayer has been chosen as the first rollups-as-a-service provider to assist Arbitrum Orbit as the Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution now moves into the Layer 3 space. Arbitrum has gained investors’ attention due to its ability to enhance the efficiency and speed of transactions on the Ethereum network.\n\nArbitrum stands out for being a fast and cost-efficient solution that sends all transaction data to the main Ethereum blockchain. With a speed of 40,000 transactions per second, Arbitrum outpaces Ethereum’s 14 TPS. Additionally, while Ethereum’s transactions can cost several dollars, Arbitrum’s transactions cost only about two cents.

While this remarkable rebound is impressive, it remains to be seen if Solana can maintain its upward momentum throughout the remainder of 2023.\n\nSolana is currently undervalued in the crypto market and offers multiple use cases as a platform for decentralized finance, NFTs, gaming, and the metaverse. Despite its significant drop in value in 2022, Solana’s potential as a Layer 1 blockchain network makes it difficult to believe that investors consider it worthless.\n\nIn other SOL news, Solana Labs announced that Saga, a crypto-focused smartphone, will be available for public purchase on May 8. The smartphone was created with the understanding that smartphone gadgets will have a significant part in the development of the crypto sector and function as specifically designed wallets for digital currencies. The idea was first teased almost 10 months ago, and Solana hopes that Saga will have a positive impact on its entire ecosystem.\n\nIn my opinion, Solana has a positive outlook, especially with its innovative crypto phone. I have been optimistic about Solana since its initial announcement.

These price shifts are beneficial for developers and users since the average fees have been decreasing over the last two years. Ethereum’s recent technological upgrades have positioned it well for future success. The switch from PoW to PoS has made it more energy-efficient and scalable. Additionally, upcoming developments such as cheaper transactions, increased security, and improved user experience make for an exciting roadmap ahead.\n\nIn summary, Ethereum appears to be a promising investment choice at present. Its growth potential is gaining attention, and its technological advancements are laying the foundation for long-term success.

The recent news articles highlight various aspects of Ethereum's ecosystem, including the surge in locked ETH, record gas fees due to meme coin mania, and changes in staking activity post-Shapella upgrade. The increase in locked ETH demonstrates growing interest in Ethereum's PoS system, indicating confidence in its long-term potential. However, high gas fees and fluctuations in staking activity may impact short-term market sentiment. Investors should monitor developments in gas fees, staking activity, and network upgrades to assess Ethereum's market trend in the near future.

"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market has been experiencing a bullish trend with increasing open prices, total value transferred, unique addresses, and successful transactions. The MACD signal also remains at a buy level, indicating a positive market trend. However, the fluctuating average gas price could potentially impact transaction costs.

On the other hand, the news analyst report presents a mixed sentiment in the ETH market, with concerns about large ETH sales by key figures and a decrease in active validator count post-upgrade. Despite these negative indicators, there are positive signs such as long-term holders accumulating ETH and the potential for the price to break above $2,000.

In reflection, it is evident that a long-term trading strategy based on on-chain data has been effective in navigating the volatile market. Short-term fluctuations driven by news sentiment have led to some profit loss, emphasizing the importance of a conservative approach.

Considering the mixed outlook, it is advisable to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains. The market trend for ETH appears to be bullish in the long term, with potential for further growth. Therefore, a cautious and conservative trading approach is warranted to manage risks effectively and capitalize on the long-term bullish trend for ETH.

Discover SCENE\n\nCryptocurrency prices rose on Wednesday after a widely-watched inflation gauge in the U.S. suggested the Federal Reserve’s fight against soaring prices is making progress.\n\nThe Consumer Price Index rose 4.9% in the 12 months through April, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said Wednesday, coming in slightly below economists' estimates of 5%.\n\nOn a month-to-month basis, the index, which tracks price movements across a broad range of goods and services, rose 0.4% in April compared to a 0.1% bump in March and a 0.4% increase in February.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin was up 1.4% over the past day, chipping away at weekly losses of 1.8% at around $27,900, according to CoinGecko.

Meanwhile, the global crypto market capitalization was sitting at $1.2 trillion—up 0.8% from the previous day.\n\n\n\nIn terms of the impact that Wednesday’s CPI print had on crypto markets, Managing Director at Wave Digital Assets Nauman Sheikh told Decrypt a lack of liquidity is likely at play, pointing to market makers like Jane Street and Jump who have scaled back.\n\n“Liquidity just fell off a cliff, so any market impact on the way up on the way down will be a little bit more exaggerated,” he said. “There's no depth to the market, which means any slight pressure on either side is just going to be exasperated.”\n\nThe index’s increase in April was largely fueled by a jump in housing prices, which grew 0.4% month-to-month, the BLS said. But the measure represented a notable decline compared to a monthly increase of 0.6% in March and 0.8% in February.\n\nThe report indicated that core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, rose 5.5% in the 12 months through April, edging down from 5.6% in March.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor the most part, inflation has steadily cooled over the past several months, down significantly from a sweltering 9.1% clip last June. Still, the latest report showed annual inflation remains far above the Fed’s target of 2%. And the U.S. central bank has jacked interest rates aggressively in response to rising prices. It’s lifted interest rates to their highest levels since 2007, delivering its 10th consecutive rate hike last week.\n\nHigher interest rates cool down the economy because of their ripple effect, impacting costs associated with credit cards and mortgages. They also weigh on stocks and other “risk” assets, such as crypto, making yields on cash reserves and U.S. Treasury Bills comparatively more attractive.\n\nThe Fed risks tipping the U.S. economy into a recession if it raises rates too quickly. And signs of stress emerged in the financial system when several banks collapsed in March. The tumult continued when First Republic Bank failed last week. Now a potential debt ceiling crisis looms.\n\nWhen the Fed decided to raise interest rates last week, Chair Jerome Powell indicated there could be a potential pause. But he said the central bank would wait and see how the economy performed before making a decision at the Fed’s next meeting in June.\n\n“The fact that [inflation] is within expectations, a bit better for the annual rate, it means the Fed will likely pause,” Kaiko analyst Dessislava Aubert told Decrypt, “Because the current banking turmoil in the U.S. is basically making traditional tightening less necessary—banks are already tightening lending standards.”"}, {'id': 3, 'time': 'Wed, 10 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum derivatives flirting with bearishness: Mind the $1,820 support - Cointelegraph', 'content': "After a brief overshoot above $2,000 on May 6, the Ether price has returned to a tight range between $1,820 and $1,950, which has been the norm for the past three weeks.\n\nAccording to the latest Ether (ETH) futures and options data, odds favor the Ether price breaking below the $1,820 support, as professional traders have been unwilling to add neutral-to-bullish positions using derivatives contracts.\n\nEther price in USD, 12-hour chart.

The average Ethereum transaction fee skyrocketed to $27.70 on May 6, the highest in 12 months, according to BitInfoCharts data. As reported by Cointelegraph, one of the main drivers behind the increase was the insatiable demand for Pepe (PEPE), among other memecoins.\n\nMoreover, the increased gas fees have driven users to layer-2 solutions, which could be interpreted as a weakness. For instance, it causes a decline in the total value locked by removing deposits from the Ethereum chain, especially in decentralized finance applications.\n\nSome analysts believe the $30 million Ether sale by the Ethereum Foundation contributed to ETH being unable to break above $2,000, as nearly 20,000 ETH were sent to the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange. The foundation’s last relevant transfer occurred in November 2021, when the price topped around $4,850 and subsequently declined by 80%.\n\nOn the macroeconomic side, the United States’ 4.9% April consumer price index (CPI) data announced on May 10, slightly below consensus, further increased investors’ expectations of stable interest rates at the next Federal Reserve meeting in June. CME Group’s FedWatch Tool showed 94% odds of stability at the current 5% to 5.25% range.\n\nTherefore, with no signs of a Fed pivot on the horizon, the demand for risk-on assets such as cryptocurrencies should remain under pressure. But if investors fear that Ether has higher odds of breaking the three-week sideways movement to the downside, i should be reflected in the ETH futures contract premium and increased costs for protective put options.\n\nEther futures reflect weak demand from longs\n\nEther quarterly futures are popular among whales and arbitrage desks. However, these fixed-month contracts typically trade at a slight premium to spot markets, indicating that sellers are asking for more money to delay settlement.\n\nAs a result, ETH futures contracts in healthy markets should trade at a 5% to 10% annualized premium — a situation known as contango, which is not unique to crypto markets.\n\nEther three-month futures annualized premium.

The news articles suggest a mixed outlook for the Ethereum (ETH) market. On one hand, the launch of an Ethereum-based carbon emission tracking platform by EY could potentially attract more enterprises to the ETH ecosystem, indicating a positive development. However, the increase in Ethereum validators' earnings due to a surge in staking rewards, driven by the trading craze of a new memecoin called Pepe, may lead to increased selling pressure as validators cash out their rewards. Additionally, the drop in OFAC-compliant blocks on Ethereum to 29% highlights the platform's censorship-resistant nature but could also raise regulatory concerns. The Ethereum derivatives market is showing signs of bearishness, with professional traders cautious about adding bullish positions, indicating a potential downside risk. Overall, the market trend for Ethereum may face some challenges in the short term, with a possible bearish bias due to these factors.

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently bullish, with positive indicators such as increasing open prices, total value transferred, unique addresses, and successful transactions. The MACD signal also supports a buy sentiment, indicating a positive market outlook.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights some mixed sentiment in the market, with concerns about potential price drops due to large ETH transfers to exchanges. However, there are also bullish signals such as increased adoption by major companies and the potential for a breakout above $2,000.

Reflecting on the recent trading performance, it is evident that long-term strategies based on on-chain data have been effective in navigating the volatile ETH market. While short-term challenges driven by news sentiment have impacted profits, focusing on long-term trends has led to successful outcomes.

Considering the synthesized reports, the overall market trend for ETH appears to be bullish in the long term, despite potential short-term volatility. It is important to prioritize long-term strategies and manage risks effectively to capitalize on the positive market outlook.

Therefore, my trading action would be to buy ETH with a confidence level of 0.8, indicating a high level of confidence in the long-term bullish trend while acknowledging the potential for short-term volatility. By adopting a more conservative trading approach and focusing on long-term strategies, I aim to maximize profits and manage risks effectively in the ETH market.

*** NEWS ANALYST RESPONSE ***
The recent incidents of Ethereum failing to finalize transactions and the temporary stoppage of the Beacon Chain have raised concerns about the network's resilience and the need for client diversity. However, the upcoming hard fork, 'Dencun,' suggests that developers are actively working to address these issues and improve the network's performance. Additionally, Santiment's analysis indicating that Ethereum may be entering an "opportunity zone" based on MVRV metrics could signal a potential bottoming out of prices. Despite these challenges, Ethereum's current price stability and slight increase in trading volume suggest a neutral sentiment in the market, with potential for price fluctuations in response to inflation data and market dynamics.

The recent data shows a consistent increase in the open price of ETH, with a slight fluctuation in average gas prices. The total value transferred has also been on the rise, indicating a growing interest and activity in the market. The number of unique addresses and successful transactions has been steadily increasing, suggesting a healthy level of participation. The MACD signal remains on a buy trend, indicating a positive outlook for the market. Overall, the data suggests a bullish trend for ETH, with potential for further growth in the near future.

NEWS ANALYST REPORT:
"""
The recent incidents of Ethereum failing to finalize transactions and the temporary stoppage of the Beacon Chain have raised concerns about the network's resilience and the need for client diversity. However, the upcoming hard fork, 'Dencun,' suggests that developers are actively working to address these issues and improve the network's performance. Additionally, Santiment's analysis indicating that Ethereum may be entering an "opportunity zone" based on MVRV metrics could signal a potential bottoming out of prices. Despite these challenges, Ethereum's current price stability and slight increase in trading volume suggest a neutral sentiment in the market, with potential for price fluctuations in response to inflation data and market dynamics.

The MACD signal remains on a buy trend, indicating a positive outlook for the market. This suggests a potential for further growth in the near future.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights some short-term challenges such as Ethereum's recent transaction failures and the need for client diversity. However, the upcoming hard fork 'Dencun' and the potential bottoming out of prices based on MVRV metrics indicate that developers are actively working to address these issues and improve the network's performance.

After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that ETH has been on a consistent uptrend with positive indicators such as increasing open prices, total value transferred, and successful transactions. The MACD signal also remains at a buy level, suggesting a bullish sentiment in the market. 

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights some short-term challenges such as record gas fees and fluctuations in staking activity that may impact market sentiment. However, the increase in locked ETH and confidence in Ethereum's PoS system indicate long-term potential for the cryptocurrency.

It is important to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains and to manage risks appropriately.

After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently bullish, with positive indicators such as increasing open prices, total value transferred, and successful transactions.

While short-term challenges may lead to some profit loss, focusing on positive on-chain data and maintaining a conservative trading approach can help navigate potential volatility and capitalize on the long-term bullish trend.

Considering the overall market trend and the need for risk management, I would take a slightly conservative approach and assign a trading action of 0.5.

The Beacon Chain serves as the consensus layer for the Ethereum network.\n\nOn May 11, Ethereum developers reported that the Beacon Chain was experiencing problems confirming transactions. Although new blocks could be proposed, an unknown issue prevented their finalization. The outage lasted around 25 minutes. A similar issue occurred on May 12, preventing block finalization for over an hour.\n\nFinality was unable to be reached for three and eight epochs, said the Ethereum Foundation in a statement shared by an Ethereum consultant on Twitter. The issue “appears to have been caused by high load on some of the Consensus Layers clients, which in turn was caused by an exceptional scenario.”\n\nThe beacon chain stopped finalizing about thirty minutes ago. I don't know why yet, but in general the chain is designed to be resilient against this, transactions will continue as usual and finalization will kick in when the problem is resolved. pic.twitter.com/utAS0uAWpG — superphiz.eth ️ (@superphiz) May 11, 2023\n\nAlthough the network was unable to finalize, live and end users were able to transact on the network thanks to client diversity, “as not all client implementations were affected by this exceptional scenario.”\n\nClient diversity relates to the number of software clients available to network validators. Greater diversity among clients means a more robust and secure network.\n\nTeky and Prysm have released upgrades that implement optimizations to prevent beacon nodes from consuming excessive resources.\n\nA similar issue occurred on March 15, delaying the Goerli testnet version of Ethereum’s “Shapella” upgrade, which was successfully deployed on April 12. Ethereum’s preexisting proof-of-work chain merged with the Beacon Chain on Sept. 15, 2022, enabling the network’s transition to proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which is faster and less energy-intensive.\n\nRecent trading hype around memecoins has increased Ethereum’s activity and staking rewards rates. According to on-chain data, validators earned $46 million in the first week of May, or 24,997 Ether (ETH), a 40% increase over the previous week’s income of $33 million, when 18,339 ETH were distributed as rewards.\n\nMagazine: Here’s how Ethereum’s ZK-rollups can become interoperable"}, {'id': 3, 'time': 'Sat, 13 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Eigen What? How EigenLayer Is Putting $34B in Staked Ethereum Back to Work - Decrypt', 'content': "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nDecrypting DeFi is Decrypt's DeFi email newsletter. (art: Grant Kempster)\n\nCrypto Twitter has been awash the past few weeks with talk of a strange new protocol called EigenLayer.\n\nSome are going as far as calling it the next Ethereum Meta, while others are already whipping up speculative airdrop guides. And at least one person is doing God’s work, helping us all pronounce the project’s name.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo, what in the hell is EigenLayer? Well, think of it as being like blockchain security-as-a-service.\n\nInstead of having to gather funds, hardware, and a series of validators to keep your newly-launched crypto project from getting 51% attacked (or worse), EigenLayer wants to put staked Ethereum back to work for you.\n\nHere’s how it works.\n\nEthereum’s proof-of-stake consensus mechanism means that the network is secured by economic incentives and penalties rather than massive warehouses of mining machines. So-called validators in such a network can join and begin earning ETH-denominated yield once they stake 32 ETH to the network. If, however, their validators go down or they behave maliciously by validating incorrect transactions, they’ll be penalized; a portion of that 32 Ethereum gets taken away.\n\nFor reference, there’s currently 19.7 million Ethereum enlisted to keep Ethereum secure, or about $34 billion today—that’s more than 16% of all Ethereum currently in circulation. Yes, it’s a lot.\n\nEigenLayer takes this a step further by rehypothecating all that staked ETH to serve the same security purposes but for other, newer projects.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRehypothecation is basically another term for using the same money twice. And because that money’s being used twice, stakers who opt-in will also enjoy an even higher yield. And the more projects that build (and gain traction), the more yield opted-in stakers can earn.\n\nGiven that the asset being staked here is also Ethereum, these other projects would also be Ethereum-based. EigenLayer’s white paper includes bridge technologies and oracle providers that could all use this double-dipped Ethereum.\n\nIn many ways, this will also make the developers’ deployment experience far easier, providing confidence that their pet project will ultimately be backed by the market’s second-largest crypto network.\n\nIt’s an odd, very crypto-native idea, but as mentioned, it’s got a lot of folks fired up. ConsenSys founder Joe Lubin said EigenLayer is “at the forefront of some of the most exciting work happening in Ethereum.”\n\nAnd in March, the project raised $50 million in a Series A round from a host of notable investors.\n\nIt’s early days, of course. For now, though, all eyes are on Eigen.\n\nDecrypting DeFi is our DeFi newsletter, led by this essay. Subscribers to our emails get to read the essay before it goes on the site. Subscribe here."}]

"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently bullish, with positive indicators such as increasing open prices, total value transferred, and successful transactions. The MACD signal also supports a buy trend, indicating a positive market sentiment. However, the news analyst report presents some challenges in the short term, such as potential selling pressure from validators cashing out rewards and regulatory concerns regarding censorship-resistant blocks on Ethereum.

In light of these reports, it is essential to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains in the ETH market. While short-term challenges may lead to some profit loss, focusing on positive on-chain data and maintaining a conservative trading approach can help navigate potential volatility and capitalize on the long-term bullish trend.

Considering the overall market trend and the need for risk management, I would take a slightly conservative approach and assign a trading action of 0.5. This reflects a moderate level of confidence in the bullish market trend for ETH while acknowledging the potential short-term challenges highlighted in the news analyst report. By balancing confidence in the market with risk management, I aim to maximize overall profit in the long run.

This was a marked departure from the all-time high (ATH) levels of 97% seen during the end of 2022.\n\nIs Shapella the reason?\n\nAs depicted, the correlation between the two cryptos has been falling since mid-to-late March. However, the rift widened after the much-awaited Shapella Upgrade went live in April, bringing some improvements unique to Ethereum.\n\nInterestingly, a similar event in September 2022, known as the Merge, which kickstarted Ethereum’s transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain, failed to bring about a considerable decoupling between the two assets.\n\nBut the recent Shapella Upgrade closed the loop on some of the key aspects of the transition that couldn’t make it to the Merge last year, thus positioning Ethereum as a full-fledged PoS network.\n\nIt is important to understand that both the assets function very differently from each other.\n\nWhile Ethereum is often used as a platform for the development of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, Bitcoin is primarily used as a store of value and a means of payment.\n\nInfact, by virtue of being a chain which hosts numerous applications, the total value locked (TVL) on Ethereum was a whopping $27 billion at the time of writing.

Steven Zheng, the Block research director, mentioned that people speculate that the reason was bugs in staking clients or MEV infrastructures.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation stated that the unfinalized blocks could lead to the re-ordering or dropping of pending transactions from the network.\n\nThe recent attack was the second one in 24 hours, with the same issue on May 11 when finality paused for about 25 minutes.\n\nYou might also like: Ethereum’s beacon chain experiences temporary halt in finalization, raising alarms\n\nAccording to an Ethereum staker, they found a production incident where all four sets of CL+EL deployed in their system were simultaneously rebooted, which is a rare phenomenon. It was then discovered that these BeaconNode Prysm suddenly doubled their memory usage, which drove the memory limit and triggered OOM.\n\nA self-proclaimed Ethereum Beacon Chain community health consultant, Superphiz.eth, clarified that transactions do not stop due to finality issues like those on Ethereum. In addition, he noted that the lack of finality had no impact on on-chain activity.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/superphiz/status/1656977820315254786?s=20\n\nAs of the time of writing, the network has fixed the issue and restored the block finalization.\n\nChanges need to be implemented on network\n\nSome services built on Ethereum may need to modify operations due to finality issues. DYdX, for example, paused deposits temporarily due to the incident and continues to investigate the matter and monitor it.\n\nSuperphiz.eth noted that he expects a third even with the second wave over. He further advised validators on the network to increase their hardware spec if they can and switch to a minority client if possible. However, he noted not to worry too much about it, even if it looks terrible. The chain keeps going and will eventually finalize.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/superphiz/status/1657106474131136512\n\nMeanwhile, it’s clear that questions about Ethereum’s stability remain and could stain its credibility in the builder’s eyes.

On May 11 and May 12, the Beacon chain, the consensus layer of the Ethereum network, was unable to reach finality on two occasions. The first occurrence lasted for 25 minutes, and the second for over an hour.\n\nAlthough the exact cause of such an incident is yet unknown, it is worth stating that this network glitch had no impact on on-chain activity and transactions were still processed.\n\nEthereum Developers Roll Out Network Patches To Tackle Finality Challenge\n\nIn response to the past week, Ethereum developers have released patches to provide a solution for network users.\n\nAccording to a tweet by Beacom Chain community health analyst superphiz, Teku and Prysm, two of Ethereum’s constitutional clients, have implemented these fixes, which will help prevent further finality issues on the Beacon chain.\n\nWe can start putting this loss of finality issue behind us, @Teku_ConsenSys and @prylabs have deployed fixes that will prevent the attestation flooding.

However, they provided assurances that the upgrades implemented by Teku and Prsym would help avoid future occurrences via optimizations that will prevent beacon nodes from high resource usage during these situations.\n\nETH Total Supply Declines Following The Merge\n\nIn other news, Ethereum’s total supply decreased in the months after The Merge.\n\nOn September 15, 2022, The Merge occurred in which the Ethereum network fully transitioned from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), leading to Ethereum 2.0.\n\nIn the 241 days after this historical event, data from the Ethereum supply analytics platform, ultrasound.money shows that ETH’s total supply has declined by 0.29%.\n\nSince The Merge, over 653,000 ETH has been burned compared to the 425,000 ETH that has been minted in the last eight months resulting in a net negative change of about -227,000 ETH.\n\nInterestingly, ultrasound.money predicts the total ETH supply to have increased at a rate of 3.244% per year had The Merge not occurred.\n\nThat said, if this deflationary trend continues, it would mean good news for long-term ETH investors. This is because a decrease in supply usually results in a rise in value.\n\nAt the time of writing, ETH is trading at $1,805.77 with a total supply of 122.89 million.

The crypto market is known for its volatility, traders and enthusiasts must keep their finger on the pulse as selecting the correct investment is critical. With the cryptocurrency market maintaining a market cap above the $1 trillion mark most of the time, many investors are constantly looking for the best cryptocurrencies to invest in.\n\nBest Cryptocurrency Investments to Buy Right Now\n\nInnovative, groundbreaking technology is the key to any successful cryptocurrency. Market movers and shakers, disrupters and enhancers provide investors with the perfect opportunity to make profits. Below are some of the best cryptocurrency investments to buy right now:\n\n1. Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin will always be on the list of the best investments, with a market cap of over $500million the once obscure cryptocurrency has become the bedrock of the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin currently has a market dominance of more than 45% with crypto experts recognising that the price of many other cryptocurrencies is dependent on Bitcoin’s price.\n\nThe leading cryptocurrency was launched in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, a person or group of people still unknown to date. Bitcoin was created to serve as peer-to-peer cash, a currency that would be independent of the government. The lack of governmental control has drawn many to the decentralized asset over the years. Another factor that has attracted users to the asset is its limited supply. The total supply of Bitcoin is limited to 21 million coins, which means that it is a deflationary asset that is resistant to inflation. This scarcity has helped to drive up the price of Bitcoin, making it an attractive option for investors looking to store value and hedge against inflation.\n\nIn 2022, Bitcoin’s price crashed violently. The crypto asset started the year trading around the $45,000 mark. However, Bitcoin ended the year below $20,000, falling as low as $15,000 at some point. Ironically, 2022 seemed to be the year when Bitcoin would reach the $100,000 milestone.\n\nPlan B, a renowned Bitcoin analyst, and proponent, deduced a system for predicting Bitcoin’s price based on supply. This unique system coined by Plan B had been effective in the past, accurately predicting the period when Bitcoin would hit the $10,000 mark and cross the $50,000 mark. The stage seemed set for the next prediction. According to Plan B’s model, BTC would reach the $100,000 mark sometime around late 2021 or early 2022. Unfortunately, that never happened.\n\nBitcoin’s price tumbled after a series of negative events in the crypto ecosystem, the most notable being the crash of LUNA and UST. After hitting unexpected lows in 2022, Bitcoin’s price is now due for some relief. Crypto investors realize that Bitcoin below $20,000 is undervalued. More so, the flagship cryptocurrency has always bounced back from black swan events and massive price crashes. In 2023, investors expect Bitcoin to bounce back from the massive fall from its peak experienced the year before.\n\nFurther, Bitcoin’s halving is expected to take place in 2024. The halving of Bitcoin would reduce block rewards to miners. This would make the crypto asset scarcer than it was. Historical price action reveals that Bitcoin always appreciates massively months after the halving. Prudent long-term investors will use the dollar-cost averaging method to invest in the asset before the next halving in 2024.\n\n2. Tradecurve – A Presale to Purchase\n\nTradecurve.io’s presale is making waves within the cryptocurrency currency market, with phase one of it’s presale rapidly selling out TCRV is showing all the signs of a profitable opportunity for investors. Designed to become the worlds first hybrid trading exchange, Tradecurve will serve as a bridge between the financial and cryptocurrency markets. Tradecurve’s unique privacy policy and disposal of KYC checks allows users of the platform to trade the financial markets in complete anonymity.\n\nTradecurve’s native utility token $TCRV powers the entire Tradecurve ecosystem and is currently priced at $0.01. Tradecurve is as an excellent opportunity for investors who are able to take advantage of its current price, a total of 40% of $TCRV will be sold during the presale.\n\nHolders of the Tradecurve token will also benefit from a number of offerings such as; access to trading academies via the metaverse, automated trading, copy trading, passive income through staking, high-leverage options, lowered subscription and trading fees. Tradecurve will also incorporate algorithmic trading, allowing users to utilize advanced algorithms and AI to execute trades with speed and precision.\n\nProviding access for investors to trade; stocks, shares, currencies, cryptocurrencies, commodities and indices all from one account, Tradecurve has set ...'}]

However, Coinbase recently received more than 53,400 ETH, out of which the majority were moved from the Coinbase’s cbETH deposit address — that may be related to the fact that ETH staking was terminated.\n\nCoinbase Witnesses Massive ETH Inflow\n\nOn Monday, the cbETH deposit address 0xc7…a019 saw a massive withdrawal of 44,000 ETH to the Coinbase 10 wallet address, as per the data obtained from CryptoQuant. This suggests that people have been terminating their ETH staking contract, which further indicates a building sell pressure for Ethereum.\n\nadvertisement\n\nA wrapped cryptocurrency, such as cbETH, is a crypto token that symbolizes another cryptocurrency that has been “wrapped” or “locked up” in a digital smart contract. Coinbase developed the ERC-20 utility token to serve as a representation of Ethereum 2.0 (ETH2) which could be obtained by staking ETH tokens on the platform.\n\nRead More: Over 1 Billion Hedera Tokens Set To Unlock On June 1, Major HBAR Price Drop Ahead?\n\nMoreover, because cbETH is a liquid token, there is no lock-up time and the token may be used for additional DeFi operations such as lending, swapping, and providing liquidity — all of which can be done directly from the Coinbase Wallet.\n\nStakers Withdraw Rewards, Not Principal\n\nThe Shanghai upgrade made it possible for Ethereum speculators to finally withdraw their funds from the mainnet. Some individuals have been holding off on doing so ever since the staking option was initially made available in December 2020.\n\nSince Ethereum’s long-awaited “Shapella” upgrade, most stakers and entities who have staked Ether have withdrawn incentives rather than their principal. According to TokenUnlocks, staking incentives accounted for more than 172,000 Ether, or more than 95% of withdrawals. Users who had completely stopped staking and would no longer take part in Ethereum’s consensus mechanism — which is used to arrange and confirm transactions — made up the remaining 5%, which was their initial stake.\n\nIn the wake of this crypto news, the price of ETH is currently exchanging hands at $1,826.91, which represents a gain of 1.31% over the past 24 hours, compared to a drop of 1.92% recorded over the preceding seven days.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin-Ether Correlation Dips Below 80% For First Time In 2 Years, What It Means?'}, {'id': 13, 'time': 'Mon, 15 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "What Is the Bitcoin Cash 'Ethereum Killer' Hard Fork? - DailyCoin", 'content': 'Bitcoin Cash will introduce a major upgrade to its blockchain.\n\nNew CashTokens will enable developers to run smart contracts on its network.\n\nOne core developer claims the network will be 100x more efficient than Ethereum.\n\n\n\nAmid major congestion on the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks, traders are begging for upgrades to boost scalability. Bitcoin Cash (BCH), one of the more successful Bitcoin hard forks, could soon deliver an upgrade to outshine both.\n\nThe Bitcoin Cash network is gearing up for its own hard fork, set for Monday, May 15. The upgrade will introduce ‘CashTokens,’ an ERC-20-like standard for the network. These tokens will enable Bitcoin Cash to run smart contracts.\n\nAccording to core developers, this decentralized Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchain will be more scalable and efficient than Ethereum.\n\nHow Will Bitcoin Cash Change After the Hard Fork?\n\nScheduled for May 15, the ‘Ethereum Killer’ is a hard fork on the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network. This means that this change to the network protocol will not be compatible with previous chain versions.\n\nThe primary feature of the latest Bitcoin Cash hard fork is the introduction of ‘CashTokens,’ which are similar to Ethereum’s ERC-20 tokens. Their introduction is a game-changer for Bitcoin Cash. The upgrade will allow developers to issue tokens directly on the BCH network.\n\nIssuing tokens (and memecoins) on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain is not the most exciting feature of the upgrade. More importantly, CashTokens will enable the blockchain to run smart contracts. This feature will allow developers to build dApps directly on Bitcoin Cash.\n\nWill Bitcoin Cash Be the Ethereum Killer?\n\nSo far, Ethereum has remained the most significant smart contract blockchain network. However, congestion issues, high fees, and other issues have led to a series of competing networks. With its latest upgrade, Bitcoin Cash will be one of them.\n\nThe hard fork will not just enable Bitcoin Cash to power smart contracts. It will also enable it to harness the built-in scalability of the network, making its smart contracts run efficiently and at a low cost. In particular, one core developer says that dApps on Bitcoin Cash will be 100x cheaper than Ethereum.\n\nBitcoin Cash developer Jason Dreyzehner claims the network owes its performance to the UTXO accounting model. UTXO stands for “unspent transaction output,” and differs from the account/balance model used by cryptos like Ethereum.\n\nTo start with the basics – Bitcoin Cash owes its performance, scalability, and privacy to the "UTXO model": funds are sent to a new contract in every transaction output, so the system never reuses "accounts", even if you re-use an address. — Jason Dreyzehner (@bitjson) June 30, 2022\n\nThe UTXO model has several features that make it potentially better than the alternative. Each transaction creates a new UTXO, making coins harder to track and boosting privacy. On the other hand, this model also enables parallel transaction processing, allowing for greater scalability.\n\nIf Bitcoin Cash becomes a scalable solution for dApps, this could help significantly boost its utility. Rather than just being a decentralized currency, BCH will power an ecosystem of decentralized applications.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nWhile Bitcoin Cash developers boast of its scalability, the network has still not seen a substantial test of its performance.\n\nDespite its similarities to BCH, including its use of the UTXO model, Bitcoin still suffers from network congestion since the creation of ordinals.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nA decentralized and scalable smart contract network would enable developers to create better dApps, boosting blockchain adoption.

Start for free\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation attributed the incident to an “exceptional scenario” which caused a high load for Teku and Prysm’s consensus layer clients. “The full cause for this is still being evaluated,” it added.\n\nTeku and Prysm’s patches include optimizations limiting resource usage during periods of network congestion.\n\nPost Mortem\n\nOn Sunday, Ben Edgington of the Ethereum Foundation and Superphiz, the Beacon Chain community health consultant, discussed the incident on YouTube.\n\nEdgington said finality occurs when at least two-thirds of validators agree on Ethereum’s state during attestations after each epoch. He said last week’s incident manifested as roughly 60% of validators failed to attest at the same time, preventing the network from reaching finality.\n\n“It [was] as if 60% of the validators went offline,” Edgington said. “To finalize the chain, we need two-thirds or 66% of validators showing up.”\n\nClient Diversity\n\nThe pair described the network’s recovery as a testament to the value of Ethereum client diversity, with only two of Ethereum’s five major clients suffering issues.\n\nEdgington said Lighthouse client users experienced no issues during the incident because Lighthouse rate-limits the reprocessing of old states. However, he said that Lighthouse’s design could cause different problems under certain circumstances.\n\n“As we’ve seen around these edge cases, it can actually strengthen things if clients take slightly different approaches because some will be able to carry the network where others fail,” he said.\n\nRecurring Problem\n\nEdgington and Superphiz agreed that it is likely that Ethereum will encounter similar issues again in the future.\n\nWhile researchers are currently unsure what exactly triggered the finalization issues, Edgington suggested the speed of the network’s growth may be driving up the computational resources needed to validate Ethereum.\n\nHe noted that Ethereum’s validator count is up by 2500% since the Beacon chain launched in December 2020, conceding that developers may have neglected large-scale stress-testing on testnets in recent years.\n\nEdgington said Ethereum’s core developers have learned their lesson and will deploy large private testnets to “stress test some of these scenarios with more realistic validator numbers.”\n\nEmergency State\n\nWhile the Ethereum network regained finalization on its own last week, Edgington and Superphiz noted that measures are in place to protect the network against a severe outage.\n\nFinalization usually occurs after two epochs, but the Beacon chain enters an emergency state called “Inactivity Leak” mode if finalization does not occur after four epochs. In this mode, validators receive no rewards for attesting but face escalating penalties for failing to do so.\n\nEdgington said the mechanism slowly drains ETH from non-performing validators until active validators come to represent a two-thirds majority and can finalize the network again.\n\nHe said the mechanism offers protection against catastrophic eve..."}, {'id': 0, 'time': 'Mon, 15 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum vs. Bitcoin: Which Crypto Is Better? - Nasdaq', 'content': 'Cryptocurrencies, also known as digital currencies, have been all the rage over the last couple of years. Coins like bitcoin have skyrocketed in recent years, and financial institutions are starting to get on board. Two of the largest and most popular coins are ethereum and bitcoin. This article explores and compares both currencies and will help you understand the pros and cons of each so you can determine which one might be right for you.\n\nRead: Looking To Diversify In A Bear Market? Consider These 6 Alternative Investments\n\nAbout Cryptocurrencies\n\nA cryptocurrency is a secure, virtual currency that is nearly impossible to counterfeit. These digital coins are assets that exist on distributed networks. The networks’ decentralized nature means that governments and other central authorities can’t control them.\n\nBlockchain technology, which is a technology based on a distributed ledger database, underpins cryptocurrencies. Cryptography and encryption techniques secure the network and prevent tampering. Every transaction is stored as a separate block on the chain, and those records are guaranteed to be accurate and immutable.\n\nEthereum vs. Bitcoin\n\nEthereum and bitcoin are arguably the most popular cryptocurrencies on the market today. They certainly are the largest by market cap. Bitcoin’s market cap is over $363 billion, while ethereum’s market cap is around $161 billion.\n\nBitcoin\n\nBitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, launched in 2009 by a crypto architect known pseudonymously as Satoshi Nakamoto. The idea for this digital currency was simple yet revolutionary. It promised an alternative to traditional currency, called fiat currency, via a decentralized and transparent financial system accessible to all.\n\nBitcoin works on a blockchain network. Transactions happen between bitcoin wallets using private keys, which provide mathematical proof of their authenticity. Cryptography ensures both the integrity and the chronological order of transactions, and a distributed consensus system confirms pending transactions.\n\nBitcoin has capped the number of coins that can be minted at 21 million. Once that number has been reached, the coins can still be traded but no more can be introduced.\n\nThe following stats from CoinMarketCap are current as of Sept. 27:\n\nBitcoin Quick Stats Price $18,973.12 Market cap $363.56 billion Market dominance 39.17%\n\nEthereum\n\nEthereum’s white paper was released in 2013, and the project officially launched in 2015. Ethereum is an open-source, community-driven project and has seen quite a bit of evolution since its inception.\n\nLike Bitcoin, Ethereum is a decentralized, peer-to-peer network that snubs censorship and surveillance. The focus of the project is to enable access to financial services and commerce for everyone. It does this by allowing for the development of other cryptos as well as the execution of smart contracts on its platform, CoinMarketCap explained.\n\nIBM describes smart contracts as programs stored on a blockchain that run automatically when predetermined conditions are met. These functionalities make Ethereum a more versatile platform than Bitcoin.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, Ethereum allows for an unlimited number of tokens.\n\nGood To Know The main difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin is the fact that Ethereum is programmable. That feature broadens the scope of Ethereum, making it more than just a digital currency. It makes Ethereum a marketplace for financial services, games and apps.\n\nEthereum Quick Stats Price $1,316.21 Market cap $161.30 billion Market dominance 17.39%\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum: Pros and Cons\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are both blockchains, but they serve different purposes, each with its own benefits and drawbacks.\n\nPros and Cons of Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin has a narrow purpose: provide an alternative to fiat currency and a system for processing transactions.\n\nPros\n\nBitcoin was the first cryptocurrency on the market.\n\nThe coin has the best brand recognition and most liquidity, which has made it the most widely accepted cryptocurrency.\n\nThere’s still huge potential growth for bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin uses blockchain technology designed to protect against fraud or identity theft.\n\nIts value is based on supply and demand, not political interference.\n\nBitcoin has a faster transaction speed than fiat currency.\n\nThe 21 million cap on bitcoins could drive prices higher by making the coin more scarce.\n\nCons\n\nBitcoin’s price is highly volatile.\n\nBitcoin has limited functionality.\n\nBitcoin uses an extreme amount of energy, which is bad for climate change.\n\nBitcoin doesn’t provide 100% anonymity.\n\nPros and Cons of Ethereum\n\nWhereas the purpose of the Bitcoin blockchain is to process transactions and store value, Ethereum is a platform that also supports the development of other projects.\n\nPros\n\nEthereum leverages blockchain technology for its decentralized, transparent system.\n\nThe technology enables functionality beyond digital currency, such as decentralized applications and smart contracts.\n\nTh...'}]

The move came as Lido launched the V2 upgrade live to mainnet on May 15.\n\nThe upgrade is the largest yet for the protocol, and it has two major components:\n\n“Lido V2 introduces two major components, with the most user-facing aspect being Ethereum withdrawals. This allows Ethereum stakers with Lido to directly unstake ETH through the protocol.”\n\nLido now has a withdrawals page where users can deposit their stETH tokens to get ETH in return.\n\nFollowing a successful on-chain vote, Lido V2 is officially here.https://t.co/36EmuagToD 🏝️ pic.twitter.com/sl4kjNpUYw — Lido (@LidoFinance) May 15, 2023\n\nLido Staking Withdrawals Live\n\nLido noted that under normal circumstances, the stETH or wstETH withdrawal period can take anywhere between 1-5 days. Furthermore, the stETH injected back into the protocol will be burnt in order to release the ETH at a 1:1 ratio.\n\nThe announcement added that the upgrade lowers a number of previous inconveniences surrounding Lido on Ethereum staking experience. Additionally, it “allows for a more efficient use of Lido’s staked ETH throughout the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem.”\n\nThe token unlocks dashboard is projecting a spike in withdrawals on May 16. It reports 45,830 ETH currently in the pending withdrawal queue, which is likely to grow once Lido stakers start withdrawing.\n\nIt estimates that almost 7,000 ETH worth around $12.6 million will be withdrawn over the next eleven hours.\n\nNansen’s dashboard is still reporting that there are more deposits than withdrawals on the Beacon Chain. It also claims a total of 20 million ETH are staked though this is likely to be on the high side since the Beaconcha.in explorer claims 18.3 million.\n\n6,274,752 ETH is staked with @LidoFinance. That’s over 29% of total deposits! And later today, Lido will enable ETH withdrawals for the very first time What will happen?

It promotes staking diversity by allowing solo stakers, DAOs, and Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) clusters.\n\nETH Price Reaction\n\nEthereum prices are marginally down on the day, trading at $1,812 at the time of writing. ETH has retreated 13% over the past month as crypto markets continue to correct.\n\nLido has 29% of all staked Ether, so withdrawals may add some selling pressure to markets in the short term.\n\nIts native LDO token has gained 7.2% on the day, climbing to $2.09 at the time of writing. Furthermore, Lido DAO tokens are up 15% over the past week.'}, {'id': 2, 'time': 'Tue, 16 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Better Buy: Cardano or Ethereum? - The Motley Fool', 'content': 'Every year, it seems, there\'s a new blockchain rival that investors think might eventually take Ethereum\'s (CRYPTO: ETH) place as the top Layer-1 blockchain. In years past, these blockchain rivals have included the likes of Solana (CRYPTO: SOL) and Avalanche (CRYPTO: AVAX). But, due to its strong track record of innovation, Ethereum has retained its market-leading position.\n\nThis year, the blockchain that everyone is talking about as a potential Ethereum rival is Cardano (CRYPTO: ADA). Year to date, Ethereum is up 53%, and Cardano is up 50%, so it\'s almost a dead heat. Let\'s take a closer look at how the two blockchains stack up to see which one is the better investment right now.\n\nEthereum\'s first-mover advantage\n\nEthereum has the first-mover advantage in just about every sector of the blockchain world. It literally invented the concept of smart contracts, so it\'s perhaps no surprise that it is still the clear leader in everything from non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to decentralized finance (DeFi). If you take a look at the top-selling NFT collections, for example, almost all of them are Ethereum-based, and it remains the top blockchain by overall NFT sales volume.\n\nBut the one drawback of Ethereum has always been its performance. There are blockchains that are faster and cheaper to use, and that has left openings for new rivals to emerge. This is the reason Solana and Avalanche first emerged as potential "Ethereum killers." Even after The Merge, Ethereum still relies on a complex network of Layer-2 scaling solutions to process transactions quickly and keep fees in check. The main Ethereum blockchain can still only process 10 to 20 transactions per second. Meanwhile, Solana routinely handles 5,000 transactions per second, and has plans to boost its capacity to 600,000 transactions per second.\n\nNew Cardano innovations\n\nThat\'s why some investors are sitting up and taking notice now that Cardano has finally introduced its long-promised Layer-2 scaling solution, Hydra. According to some Cardano developers, Hydra is the key to 1 million transactions per second. That\'s a performance benchmark that Ethereum has been promising (but failing to deliver) for years. At 1 million transactions per second, the Cardano blockchain would be nearly 15 times faster than Visa\'s credit card network, which claims to be capable of processing 65,000 transactions per second.\n\nAnd Cardano has suddenly boosted its profile in the DeFi world, where for years it was a non-player. DeFi is a new priority for Cardano in 2023, and thus far, the blockchain has delivered. It has a new stablecoin, new decentralized exchanges, and new DeFi protocols. Combined, all of these innovations could make it possible for Cardano to create a robust DeFi ecosystem. It\'s too early to say that Cardano is a serious rival to Ethereum, given that it still ranks No. 18 among all blockchains in DeFi. However, the case can now be made that it\'s no longer a so-called ghost chain where nothing ever happens.\n\nWho is innovating faster?\n\nAt the end of the day, the blockchain sector is just like any other part of the tech industry. Innovation matters, and investors are willing to pay a premium for tokens on blockchains that appear to be innovating faster. Right now, Ethereum is still riding high after pulling off The Merge last year -- a technological feat that some have compared to changing the engine of an airplane in mid-flight. So the innovation bar is high these days. Investors are looking for truly breakthrough innovations, not just incremental improvements.\n\nUltimately, the answer to the question of which blockchain is innovating faster might come down to performance in newly emerging areas such as artificial intelligence (AI). The blockchain that secures a clear first-mover advantage in AI, for example, could be the one to invest in for long-term growth. Thus far, neither Cardano nor Ethereum has emerged as the obvious market leader, although Cardano does seem to have the makings of an AI strategy.\n\nAnd the winner is...\n\nRight now, I\'m bullish on both Ethereum and Cardano. Both blockchains have seen stellar gains thus far in 2023. But, given Ethereum\'s track record of delivering performance over a longer period of time and its entrenched status as the market leader, the nod goes to Ethereum as the better buy.'}, {'id': 3, 'time': 'Tue, 16 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': '3 reasons why Ethereum price could struggle at the $1.9K level - Cointelegraph', 'content': "Since May 12, Ether’s price has been struggling to sustain its $1,800 support level, as investors face pressures from a worsening crypto regulatory environment and the Ethereum network’s high gas fees. Also negatively impacting Ether’s (ETH) price are three indicators signaling reduced demand for its decentralized applications (DApps) and a lack of leverage buying demand from professional traders.\n\nRegulators signal their plan to further limit crypto intermediaries\n\nAccording to court documents filed on May 15, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has given a formal response in court in relation to Coinbase’s petition for clear crypto regulation. The SEC stated that any rulemaking may take years and that enforcement actions will continue in the meantime.\n\nOn May 16, the Economic and Financial Affairs Council of the European Union — comprising finance ministers of all member states — approved the highly anticipated Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, which will come into effect by mid-2024.\n\nSome argue that MiCA facilitates business growth in the region. Others focus on the privacy risks for personal users’ data and the risks imposed on non-custodial solutions, including decentralized finance applications.\n\nThe drop in DApp deposits is concerning\n\nThe Ethereum network is experiencing problems caused by surging gas fees — the cost associated with transactions, including those performed by smart contracts. For the past four weeks, the average transaction fee has stood above $9, which severely limited the demand for DApp usage.\n\nTotal deposits on the Ethereum network in Ether terms plunged to their lowest levels since August 2020. Such an analysis excludes the effects of native Ethereum staking, which recently started to allow withdrawals.\n\nEthereum network applications' total deposits in ETH. Source: DefiLlama\n\nAccording to DefiLlama data, Ethereum DApps reached 14.9 million ETH in total value locked (TVL) on May 16. That compares with 16.5 million ETH two months prior, a 10% decline. As a comparison, TVL on BNB Smart Chain in BNB (BNB) terms was essentially flat in the same period, while Polygon (MATIC) deposits on the Polygon network increased by 29%.\n\nBNB Smart Chain attempts to take a lead in DEX volume\n\nEthereum might have been the absolute leader in decentralized exchange (DEX) volume since its inception, but this position is being challenged. Ethereum’s market share by volume on DEXs peaked at 75% in the week ending March 5 but steadily declined to its lowest level ever, 39.6%, in the week ending May 14.\n\nWeekly DEX volume by chain. Source: DefiLlama\n\nGainers since March 5 on DEX trading volume were Arbitrum, increasing to 14% from 7%, and BNB Smart Chain, growing to 31% from 5.6%. One might argue that the success of the Ethereum network’s scaling solutions reflects bullishness for Ether’s price, but that relationship is not so direct.\n\nRelated: Updated European tax directive requires reporting on all crypto asset transfers\n\nData shows pro traders turning bearish\n\nEther quarterly futures are popular among whales and arbitrage desks. However, these fixed-month contracts typically trade at a slight premium to spot markets, indicating that sellers are asking for more money to delay settlement.\n\nAs a result, ETH futures contracts in healthy markets should trade at a 5 to 10% annualized premium — a situation known as contango, which is not unique to crypto markets.\n\nEther 3-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nEther professional traders have avoided leverage longs (bullish bets) since early April. Moreover, the current 1% ETH futures premium is on the edge of becoming negative, known as backwardation — if confirmed, this is an alarming red flag, as bearish demand dominates the scene.\n\nIn short, these three indicators — namely, the reduced TVL, record-low DEX market share and lack of leverage buying demand — signal the $1,900 resistance will be hard to break in the short term. For now, Ether bears are in control, favoring the odds of a price correction.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

At least one firm — Kelly Strategic Management — filed for an ETF that would have invested in ether futures. Soon after, however, the firm withdrew its application.\n\nThe SEC, however, has given the green light to ETFs that invest in bitcoin futures. The now-$928mn ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) was the first to launch in October 2021.\n\nThis article was previously published by Ignites, a title owned by the FT Group.\n\nThe SEC has rejected bids for physical bitcoin ETFs due to the potential for fraud and manipulation. SEC chair Gary Gensler has called bitcoin a “Wild West” market that leaves investors less protected than stock and bond markets.\n\nIf approved by the SEC, the five ETFs will invest primarily in ether futures traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the filings show.\n\nEther is the native cryptocurrency of the ethereum network, a “decentralised network of computers that operates on cryptographic protocols”, Grayscale’s filing notes. The funds will not invest directly in ether or any digital assets.\n\nThe five ETFs’ investment strategies are largely the same, prospectuses show. They will invest in wholly owned subsidiaries organised under the laws of the Cayman Islands.\n\nRepresentatives from the issuers did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n“No news is good news for bitcoin futures ETFs, and it’s a good sign for the prospect of futures-based ether ETFs, as well,” said Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research for North America at Morningstar. “There isn’t any evidence that bitcoin ETFs were a failed experiment for the SEC, so this may be the right time for these funds to be approved.”\n\nShortly after it launched, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF amassed $1bn in assets at a faster pace than any previously launched ETF. However, its net asset value plunged 63.7 per cent in 2022. Since its inception, market depreciation has erased $1.3bn in investor assets.\n\nOther bitcoin futures ETFs, such as ones from VanEck and Valkyrie, have struggled to keep up. The VanEck ETF has just $41mn in assets and Valkyrie’s has $30mn, respectively, according to FactSet data.\n\nThere was a “good case” for the SEC to approve the ether futures ETFs for the same reason that they approved the bitcoin futures ETFs in the first place, noted Matt Apkarian, associate director for product development at Cerulli Associates.\n\n“The fact that these are digital asset futures doesn’t really change what the SEC needs to see relative to any other futures-based exchange-traded products,” Apkarian said.\n\nGrayscale might also be calling the SEC’s bluff in regard to its statements in favour of futures-based crypto ETFs, Armour noted.\n\nIn June Grayscale sued the SEC after the regulator rejected its bid to convert its Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. The firm claimed in the lawsuit that the SEC had no grounds to reject a spot bitcoin ETF after approving futures ETFs. The suit is ongoing.\n\nLatest news on ETFs Visit the ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools helping you to understand everything from performance to ESG ratings\n\nThe “rest of the pack” might just be jumping in line, in case the SEC approved these ETFs, rather than signalling increased optimism that they would be given the go-ahead, Armour said.\n\nRoundhill and Direxion do not currently offer any crypto-related products. Bitwise, meanwhile, runs a $477mn 10 Crypto Index Fund and $70mn Crypto Industry Innovators ETF (BITQ), which invests in companies that derive most of their revenue from the crypto ecosystem, not crypto directly.\n\nIn March, Bitwise launched the Bitwise Bitcoin Strategy Optimum Roll ETF (BITC), a futures ETF designed for long-term investors.\n\n“I wouldn’t be surprised to see this become somewhat of a winner-take-most scenario like we saw with BITO,” Apkarian said, referring to ProShares’ Bitcoin futures ETF. “I think the first-mover advantage is likely why we are seeing so many firms trying to launch so quickly right now.”\n\n*Ignites is a news service published by FT Specialist for professionals working in the asset management industry.

New mechanisms introduced by EIP-1559 in 2021 brought in the burning of base fees, causing deflationary conditions for the network.\n\nThis fee model contributes to the narrative of Ethereum as “ultrasound money,” reducing the supply of ETH as on-chain activity drives demand. Adam Smith might have been on to something.\n\nIn theory, a reduction in supply should increase Ethereum’s value as an asset in the long term.

Is there an investment thesis there?”\n\nEIP-1559 opened the monetary door\n\nFelman says the “best thing” Ethereum ever did for itself was the implementation of EIP-1559, which made ETH as an asset more attractive for investment.\n\n“It opened the door for so much institutional capital to come into this space,” he says.\n\n“I gave a talk last week at a conference that was filled with a lot of pension fund allocators, a lot of institutional allocators. I got an obscene amount of questions on it,” Felman says.\n\n“My job,” he says, was to “teach these guys about what crypto is, cuz these guys knew, when I say nothing, I mean literally nothing, about crypto.”\n\nFelman suggests Ethereum fee burns behave like traditional finance stock buybacks. Just as a company can buy back their own equity to indirectly increase value for shareholders, a fee burn can indirectly drive price action for anyone holding ETH. “If ETH annualizes out to $5 billion a year in burn fees, that’s a pretty substantial ‘buyback,’ right?”\n\n“And this is all during a bear market,” he adds.\n\n“That really hit home for a lot of people.”\n\nEthereum stands apart from other layer-1 protocols because of this formula, Felman says.\n\nOther layer-1s like Solana, he says, do not generate fees in the same way — and, importantly, do not burn fees to reduce supply. Alternative layer-1s as such do not “generate revenue for their shareholders in the same way that Ethereum does,” so “allocators are just way less likely to come in and buy it.”\n\n“Because all eyes are on Ethereum, because that’s where the speculative money is, because that’s where the market participants are, they’re able to charge those fees,” he says.\n\nFelman compares the current attractiveness of Ethereum to the appeal of living in New York. “Yes, Manhattan’s expensive, but it’s expensive for a reason — because everybody’s there, and everybody that you want to be around is already there.”\n\nAnd the beauty of proof of stake is that all of those fees that are burned and all the fees that are generated, Felman says, “are now paid back to owners of the asset.”\n\nDon’t miss the next big story – join our free daily newsletter.'}, {'id': 14, 'time': 'Wed, 17 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'The 3 Types of Cryptos That Could Outperform Bitcoin This Year - The Motley Fool', 'content': "Even with its recent pullback from the $30,000 price level, Bitcoin remains one of the top-performing cryptos of 2023. It is up 65% this year, and it's hard to find any large market-cap coins that can top this.\n\nBut savvy investors know it's best not to put all your eggs into one basket. If you are looking to diversify your crypto portfolio, here are three types of digital coins that could outperform Bitcoin this year.\n\n1. Potential Ethereum replacements\n\nWhile Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) continues to be the dominant Layer 1 blockchain in the crypto world, there are plenty of up-and-comers that hope to dethrone it. Three rivals that stand out are Solana, Aptos, and Fantom. Both Solana and Aptos are up more than 100% this year, and Fantom is not too far behind, at 93%.\n\nJudging from their performance, investors are not entirely convinced that Ethereum is going to retain its dominant role in so many key blockchain sectors, ranging from non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to decentralized finance (DeFi). While The Merge helped to improve the speed, efficiency, and scalability of the core Ethereum blockchain, these blockchain rivals are still much faster and cheaper. That has huge implications in areas such as DeFi, where users are looking for near-zero fees and near-instantaneous settlement of transactions.\n\nOf these Ethereum rivals, my personal pick is Solana, which has been out-innovating Ethereum of late. For example, Solana recently launched the first-ever mobile phone for a major blockchain network (the Saga) and has been exploring new initiatives to leverage all the hype and excitement around artificial intelligence, including a new plug-in for ChatGPT. For Solana to outperform Bitcoin, it will need to show that mobile crypto and crypto AI are sustainable, long-term growth catalysts.\n\n2. Scaling solutions for Ethereum\n\nIf you are looking for a less risky way to outperform Bitcoin, then blockchain scaling solutions for Ethereum could be the answer. Simply stated, these scaling solutions sit on top of the main blockchain and help Ethereum process transactions faster and cheaper.\n\nFor that reason, they are referred to as Layer 2 solutions (i.e., they are the second layer on top of the base Ethereum layer). Each scaling solution uses its own form of proprietary technology to accomplish its goals, so it can sometimes be difficult to differentiate among these different solutions.\n\nIf you buy into the idea that these Layer 2 coins are essential to the future success of Ethereum, then there are a few key prospects to target, including Immutable, Optimism, and Polygon. The name that's probably most familiar to investors will be Polygon, which has been making waves recently with new NFT initiatives, including a high-profile partnership with Nike to create an entirely new NFT marketplace for digital sneakers. However, if you are craving maximum upside potential, a better pick might be Immutable, which is up a mind-blowing 99% this year.\n\n3. Cryptos that help people stake on Ethereum\n\nLastly, there are a growing number of cryptos that help people stake on Ethereum. Now that Ethereum has transformed from a proof-of-work blockchain into proof of stake, this is tremendously important. Crypto staking is suddenly big business, and investors are always looking for ways to earn the highest staking rewards possible.\n\nThe two big names to watch here are Lido DAO, which is up 95% this year, and Rocket Pool, which is up 157% this year. Both emerged from relative obscurity after The Merge due to the popularity of staking, and both now currently rank in the Top 50 cryptos in terms of market capitalization.\n\nWhich of these is the best buy?\n\nThe common theme of all three categories of cryptos detailed above is that they somehow involve Ethereum. The first category, for example, includes all those capable of displacing Ethereum one day as the preeminent Layer 1 blockchain. The second category includes all digital currencies helping Ethereum scale bigger and faster. And the third category includes all cryptos that involve staking on Ethereum.\n\nSo if the prospect of picking winners and losers in niche areas of the blockchain space seems too daunting, the classic buy-and-hold crypto is Ethereum, which is up a not-too-shabby 52% this year.\n\nBut if you're looking for a little extra turbocharging for your portfolio, then my best picks would be Solana and Polygon. I'm long-term bullish on both of them, and I still regard both as best-in-class for their respective blockchain categories."}]

The news articles suggest a mixed market trend for Ethereum (ETH). On one hand, the emergence of a significant Ethereum whale staking 4,032 ETH after being dormant for over two years could indicate renewed interest and investment in the cryptocurrency. Additionally, the deployment of Visa's first paymaster smart contract on the ETH testnet shows continued interest from major players in exploring Ethereum's capabilities for automated programmable payments. However, the surge in users moving from Ethereum to Solana due to high transaction fees on the former could potentially impact Ethereum's market dominance and transaction volume.

Decentralised Finance (DeFi) is coming into the spotlight, and with its accessibility, affordability, and convenience, it’s no surprise to see why.Blockchain networks are the heart of cryptocurrency, and DeFi blockchains offer several altcoins the support they need. Meanwhile, the industry is also welcoming new DeFi cryptocurrencies like Big Eyes Coin (BIG) , which is wrapping up its iconic presale to launch very soon.Do Big Eyes have what it takes to take over the top DeFi blockchains like Ethereum and Avalanche? Read on to find out.Launched in 2014, the Ethereum network is the founder’s solution to Bitcoin’s inability to attach real-world assets to its blockchain and its need for a robust language to carry this process out. Ethereum has since grown to accommodate 1589 tokens, and its native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), is now the second largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalisation.Ethereum provides a highly versatile platform for building decentralised applications using the Solidity programming language and Ethereum Virtual Machine. Developers who create smart contracts on Ethereum benefit from a mature ecosystem of developer tools and best practices.The platform’s maturity also reflects in the user experience, with user-friendly wallets such as MetaMask, Argent, and Rainbow, enabling easy interaction with the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts. The extensive user base of Ethereum motivates developers to deploy their applications on the network, solidifying Ethereum’s position as the leading platform for DeFi and NFTs.Avalanche started in 2018 as a protocol to solve the issue of unreliable machine crashes. Later, it was developed by a research team. They made a start-up company that would meet the finance industry’s needs. The company introduced its native token AVAX in 2020.The Avalanche network boasts several advantages. The maximum supply of AVAX coins is 720 million, but AVAX holders who vote to adjust the reward for adding a new block to the Avalanche blockchain determine the coin creation rate. Transaction fees vary depending on transaction type and network congestion, and all fees are burned to reduce the number of coins in circulation.AVAX fees are subject to change based on user voting. Transactions on the Avalanche blockchain are confirmed using a unique method requiring random network participant subsets to confirm transactions. Network participants can earn more AVAX rewards for processing transactions by maintaining high uptime and fast response times.For a while now, the brand new DeFi meme coin, Big Eyes (BIG), has created quite a stir with its presale . This was no ordinary feat, as BIG has managed to break the presale record of Ether itself. And launching on the 15th of June, BIG is preparing to take over Ethereum’s network as an ERC-20 token.What makes the Big Eyes Coin goal plausible? It boasts an ecosystem free from buying, selling, and trading tax. The supply is limited to 200 billion tokens, but 75% will be available on launch and locked in a liquidity pool to provide stability and liquidity to the token. In other words, remember how Bitcoin’s price skyrocketed when there was high demand but limited supply?But this isn’t just about making a fortune. Big Eyes Coin has set aside 5% of its supply to create a charity wallet that supports ocean sanctuaries. A cat has got to eat. The good intentions come from a passionate community that powers this paw-dorable coin. This is evident from their ever-so-happening Twitter handle and the 26,000-member Telegram group But that’s not all. Their roadmap includes projects that cater to the broader investor base. There is an NFT Space, the Sushi Crew, under development.As they wrap up their presale on the 3rd of June, Big Eyes Coin has one last trick up its sleeve. Until the end of the presale, the team is selling BIG tokens for its Stage 3 price, which is only $0.00017 per token. Go BIG, or go home with Big Eyes!Big Eyes Coin flaunts unmatched potential with its plethora of features and offerings. With a track record of collecting over $38.3 million in the presale stage, it is on its way to taking over the best DeFi blockchains.

However, imagine a near-future scenario where computers have advanced to such a level that current cryptographic standards become insufficient.\n\nThe Quantum Resistance Corporation, Friday, May 19, 2023, Press release picture\n\nThis potential danger arises from quantum computers, a cutting-edge technology that has the potential to compromise many of the encryption protocols used in cryptocurrencies today. Although quantum computers are in their infancy and not yet powerful enough to do so, experts predict that, if current trends continue, they could threaten blockchain networks by 2030.\n\nQuantum Resistant Ledger ( QRL ) aims to address this doomsday threat as the world's first post-quantum store of value and decentralized communication network to proactively tackle the threat of advanced quantum computing. The following article will deep dive into the nature of the quantum threat, and explain how QRL could be positioned to transform the industry by providing a post-quantum solution.\n\nThe Quantum Threat to Cryptocurrency\n\nBefore delving into how QRL offers a solution to the quantum threat to cryptocurrency , it is important to understand how quantum computers work and the current risks associated with popular blockchains such as Ethereum and Bitcoin.\n\nWhat Is Quantum Computing?\n\nQuantum computers are a type of supercomputer with far superior processing power than classical computers. They are able to carry out many computations while simultaneously considering several different configurations - this makes them exponentially faster than traditional computers.\n\nOver the past few years, quantum computing has shown significant progress in various fields, including AI, weather forecasting and medical research. However, in the wrong hands, quantum computing has the potential to pose a substantial risk to cybersecurity, and consequently, to cryptocurrencies as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor example, Google's 54-qubit Sycamore processor completed a computation in 200 seconds that would have taken the most powerful classical computer in the world 10,000 years . According to a report by IBM , in theory, cryptographic protocols can be solved within a few hours with quantum computers.\n\nTypes of Quantum Attacks\n\nBroadly speaking, traditional cryptocurrencies face two primary types of threats, which are:\n\nStorage Attacks: An attack that targets individual wallet addresses, trying to break their security and steal the cryptocurrency stored in them.\n\nTransit Attacks: An attack that focuses on taking control of all transactions happening in real-time on the network.\n\nVulnerabilities of Existing Cryptocurrencies\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum, the world's two largest cryptocurrencies, account for almost 60% of the industry's total market capitalization. Bitcoin as an asset functions like digital gold, providing a decentralized, immutable and secure store of value. Conversely, Ethereum is like a publicly shared computer network that enables developers to create applications on decentralized servers.\n\nWhen it comes to storage attacks, Ethereum is at a higher risk than Bitcoin. A recent Deloitte study revealed that about 65% of all Ether is vulnerable to quantum attacks, significantly more than the 25% of vulnerable Bitcoin.\n\nTransit attacks, though more severe, are also more challenging to execute. According to Mark Webber at the University of Sussex in the U.K., breaking this level of encryption would reportedly require a quantum computer with 1.9 billion qubits of power.\n\nThis number is staggering, especially when compared to IBM's most advanced quantum computer, which has only 127 qubits in comparison. Ethereum's creator, Vitalik Buterin, tweeted in 2019 that current speculations about quantum computing are as distant from real quantum computing as hydrogen bombs are from nuclear fusion. But rapid advancements in AI-assisted technology could be changing the outlook and accelerating the quantum timeline.\n\nQRL's Quantum-Safe Blockchain Technology\n\nTraditional cryptographic methods such as RSA and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) rely on computational complexity for security. However, this model is an ineffective long-term solution since quantum computers can solve these methods. QRL says it solves this vulnerability by creating cryptography based on problems that are believed to be resistant to quantum attacks, providing enhanced security in the quantum era.\n\nOne of the key components of QRL's cryptography is the eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme (XMSS). This is a unique mathematical function that is designed to allow for secure and efficient transaction authentication when taking into account the trends of quantum computers.\n\nIn addition to securing transactions, QRL leverages advanced techniques such as on-chain lattice key storage and layer-to-internod..."}]

After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the market trend for ETH is currently bullish, with indicators such as high trading volume, active addresses, and a buy signal from the MACD suggesting potential price increases in the near future. The news analyst report presents a mixed picture, with positive developments like the staking of a significant ETH whale and Visa's interest in Ethereum's capabilities, but also highlighting competition from other blockchain networks like Solana.

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that long-term strategies based on on-chain data have been effective in navigating the volatile ETH market. While short-term uncertainties and regulatory risks exist, a moderately conservative trading approach that balances risk management with capitalizing on growth opportunities is recommended.

Considering the overall market trend and the importance of long-term strategies, I would take a slightly bullish stance on ETH and make a trading action of 0.5, indicating moderate confidence in the market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately. This decision is based on the positive on-chain indicators and the potential for further price increases in the near future, despite the mixed signals from the news analyst report.

The coin’s progenitor, Ripple, scored a small courtroom victory against the SEC in the latter’s ongoing lawsuit against the company for selling XRP as an unregistered security.\n\nOn Tuesday, Judge Analisa Torres blocked the SEC’s motion to seal documents linked to a speech by former SEC director Bill Hinman explaining why Bitcoin and Ethereum should not be considered securities. Torres said the documents in question were “subject to a strong presumption of public access.”\n\nRipple’s defense previously made Hinman’s case for XRP, but the SEC countered that Hinman’s speech represented Hinman’s personal views before unsuccessfully requesting the motion to seal the documents.\n\nRipple made headlines again on Thursday with the news that it has launched its Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) platform. The platform is pitched to central banks and governments looking to create their own centrally-issued stablecoins, alongside financial institutions that will distribute them and the users—both retail and corporate—that will trade, hold and use them.\n\nAnother big mover was Litecoin (LTC) which this week blew up 13.2% and trades for $91.29 at the time of writing.

Speaking at a keynote session, Gensler insisted “the rules have already been published” and added his agency “stands ready to help them to come into compliance.”\n\nThe SEC’s position is widely perceived as disingenuous because the regulator is simultaneously bombarding the industry with lawsuits. Even one of the SEC’s own Commissioners, Hester Pierce, has dissented a couple of times due to the lack of clarity, most recently over her agency’s decision to shut down Kraken’s staking platform and its proposal to amend the definition of “exchange” to bring crypto companies into its jurisdiction.\n\nAnother noteworthy event on Monday was the SEC’s response to Coinbase’s petition for a writ of mandamus, an order that would require the agency to clarify its rules on crypto regulations. The regulator’s lawyers urged the court to dismiss Coinbase’s request.\n\nAround the world\n\nIn the South Korean press on Monday, Samsung announced its partnership with the Bank of Korea (BOK) to jointly conduct research aimed at developing an ecosystem for a CBDC.\n\nBoth parties signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to deepen their research into offline CBDC payments, according to a Korea Herald report.\n\nSamsung previously participated in BOK’s CBDC pilot project last year, developing offline CBDC technology to enable transfers and payments through near-field communication (NFC), even when the transaction’s sender and recipient devices were not connected to the internet.\n\nOn Tuesday, European Union Finance Ministers adopted the bloc’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) bill with no objections. This marks the final step in the process of the legislation coming into force and now means that the EU has a comprehensive and uniform set of guidelines for regulating crypto throughout its 27 member states.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFinally on Wednesday, a cross-party committee of British MPs on Wednesday published a report recommending that the British government legislates crypto as gambling. The bizarre proposal envisions handing oversight to the Gambling Commission and includes possible taxes to support addiction and debt advice.'}, {'id': 8, 'time': 'Sat, 20 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'The Weaknesses of Ethereum VS Modern Blockchains: Interview With Radix - CryptoPotato', 'content': 'If the slew of smart contract hacks that netted attackers over $3 billion in 2022 has taught us anything, it’s that decentralized finance (DeFi) is still an immature industry.\n\nBesides exploits, DeFi still faces scaling issues related to the computational power needed to power complex transactions, and the throughput needed to support the worldwide financial system in the coming years.\n\nAs the current king of DeFi, the Ethereum network is worth assessing to identify the problems and limitations contributing to the industry’s current roadblocks.\n\nAt Consensus 2023, CryptoPotato sat down with Piers Ridyard – CEO of RDX Works – to discuss ways in which Ethereum is not truly optimized for DeFi. He explained some of the better-suited technology underlying modern blockchains, including the newly popular smart contract platform Radix.\n\nEthereum’s Clunky Programming Language\n\nAccording to Ridyard, DeFi in crypto is currently lacking in three major areas: user experience, developer experience, and scalability.\n\nThe first two issues largely stem from the less-than-ideal programming languages for developers to express their ideas for particular financial applications. One such language, he said, is Ethereum’s Solidity.\n\n“Solidity is like banging your head against a brick wall,” he stated. “If you want to build assets that are highly secure and you want to build financial applications that are highly secure, it’s basically impossible to make it secure in a way that is easy for developers to use.”\n\nRidyard’s company RDX Works is a core developer for Radix – a DeFi-focused blockchain whose native token, XRD, roared upwards by over 200% from early to mid-April.\n\nUnlike Ethereum and other chains, Radix uses a unique programming language called Scrypto, which is specifically focused on making financial applications easier to build and use.\n\n\n\nUnderneath Scrypto is the Radix engine which includes primitives that are part of the ledger itself, providing the essential building blocks for developers to build apps without having to start complex development from scratch.\n\n“You are not creating your own smart contract that then defines what it means to be a token, what it means to be a token transfer and tracking balances,” said Ridyard. “All of that is done by the ledger itself.”\n\nThe Radix engine also protects applications on the platform from “reentrancy attacks,” a common DeFi loophole that lets a hacker continually withdraw from a smart contract until the victim goes bankrupt. Specifically, the engine prevents infinite callbacks that lead to recursive loops which let hackers drain a contract to zero.\n\nIn February, the DeFi protocol dforce lost $3.6 million to such a bug. “A whole host of maybe half a billion dollars worth of hacks that have just been from reentrancy disappear just because of how we’ve implemented the architecture,” said Ridyard.\n\nEthereum’s Consensus Mechanism\n\nEthereum’s “Merge” upgrade in September – which changed its consensus mechanism from proof of work to proof of stake – was widely praised as the greatest technical feat in the history of crypto. However, in 2023, even proof of stake may be proving less advanced of a mechanism than what newer chains can offer – especially on the scalability front.\n\nFor example, Ethereum doesn’t allow for the parallel execution of transactions that would enable massive throughput. All transactions must be ordered, even if they are unrelated to each other.\n\nBy contrast, Radix uses the “Cerberus” consensus mechanism, which obviates the need for ordering. “They can start and end whenever they need to start and end, and you don’t need to agree between them which one came first and which one came second,” said Ridyard.\n\nRadix still comes baked in with a delegated proof of stake system that protects Cerberus. However, Ridyard doesn’t consider either proof of work or proof of stake to be “consensus mechanisms,” but rather “civil protection mechanisms.”\n\n“A consensus mechanism, is how do the nodes come to an agreement. The civil mechanism is about, how do you defend those nodes from being maliciously attacked in the process of coming to an agreement,” he elaborated.\n\nRidyard said he admired proof of stake for its energy efficiency, but noted that proof of work chains – like Bitcoin – solve certain “bootstrapping” and “randomization” problems.\n\nDeFi and the SEC\n\nBesides technological limitations, DeFi and the blockchains underpinning it are currently under immense regulatory pressure from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The agency currently seeks to regulate DeFi exchanges under existing securities exchange laws.\n\nWhile Ridyard sees a possibility that regulators “kill” DeFi in America for a period, he doesn’t envision the industry dying globally due to the overwhelming benefit it can provide certain economies. Ultimately, he believes “reading the tea leaves” of how regulators will interpret certain enforcement rules is a bit of a distraction, and that DeFi will ult...'}, {'id': 10, 'time': 'Sat, 20 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Who invented NFTs?: A brief history of nonfungible tokens - Cointelegraph', 'content': 'A brief history of NFTs: From inception to global recognition What started with Bitcoin-based colored coins in 2012–2013 became a phenomenon in 2021 and is still thriving. The Ethereum blockchain had a pivotal role in popularizing NFTs. Though 2021 turned out to be the year of Nonfungible tokens (NFTs), it wasn’t the year when the technology was invented. Kevin McCoy minted the first NFT, “Quantum,” on the Namecoin blockchain in 2014. Nonetheless, the inception of Bitcoin-based colored coins in 2012–2013 marked the beginning of the concept that led to the development of BRC-20 tokens. This idea stemmed from a paper authored by Meni Rosenfield in 2012, and it paved the way for the evolution of digital tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. The world, however, noticed NFTs in 2017. This was mainly due to the arrival of the Ethereum blockchain, which overcame the limitations in the blockchains prior to it when it came to hosting NFTs. Ethereum not only provided NFTs with a reliable solution for critical things such as token creation, storage, programming and trading but also lowered the entry barrier for launching NFT projects. A brief history of NFTs can be segregated into a timeline:\n\nThe evolution of NFTs: From colored coins to the emergence of Rare Pepes and Spells of Genesis As mentioned, the story took off with colored coins, which were created to represent and manage ownership of real-world assets on the blockchain. They were different from Bitcoin (BTC) because of the “nonfungible” element that provided them with a unique utility. Demonstrating a humongous leap in Bitcoin’s capabilities, colored coins were composed of tiny fractions of a Bitcoin, which could be as minuscule as a satoshi. Use cases of colored coins, such as the representation of property, coupons, or usage as digital collectibles, subscriptions, shares and access tokens, helped people realize the potential of blockchains for issuing assets. Bitcoin, however, was never intended to be used as a database for tokens, which meant that colored coins just remained at the concept level. However, the development did set off a series of experiments that culminated in NFTs. The first of the NFTs was “Quantum,” as mentioned before, an octagon-shaped animation. The arrival of Ethereum provided NFTs with the platform they required to flourish. A major project of this period that enabled the development of digital assets was The Counterparty platform built on Bitcoin. A spectrum of “Rare Pepes” NFTs was released on The Counterparty, initiating the use case of NFT as artwork. “Spells of Genesis,” created on Ethereum, was another big NFT project after The Counterparty.\n\nThe rise of NFTs in gaming and the metaverse: From CryptoPunks to Axie Infinity Ethereum introducing a set of token standards facilitated the steady movement of NFTs toward the blockchain. The token standard informs developers how to deploy new tokens. The success of the Rare Pepes was followed by Larva Labs, a software development company that launched CryptoPunks, its own generative series of NFTs, created by John Watkinson and Matt Hall. Inspired by London punk culture, the project has 10,000 unique pieces, with no two characters resembling each other. CryptoPunks became a huge success and was the foundation of many other NFT projects, including the Bored Ape Yacht Club, one of the biggest NFT collections. The next major launch was CryptoKitties, which came up during the ETHWaterloo hackathon, back in October 2017. The game enables players to buy, sell and create NFTs representing virtual cats with desirable traits on Ethereum. Post CryptoKitties, NFT gaming became increasingly popular. NFT gaming combined with metaverse projects to formulate a new momentum. A major project of this era was Ethereum-based Decentraland, a virtual world that allows players to explore games and build and collect assets. In October 2018, Axie Infinity, an NFT-based battle game, was released. It set the ball rolling for play-to-earn (P2E) games, which enabled gamers to earn in-game rewards while playing.

BTC has faced difficulty surpassing the $30,000 mark, while ETH has consistently struggled to exceed $2,000. Surprisingly, holders exhibited stronger convictions than selling off and held onto their assets more firmly.\n\nRead Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum struggle to…\n\nBitcoin breached the $30,000 price zone on the daily timeframe chart around 11 April, but struggled to sustain this level for an extended period. Subsequently, it dropped below $30,000. At press time, it was trading at approximately $26,900, reflecting a small gain.\n\nThe price range tool indicated that BTC has experienced a decline of over 10% since testing the $30,000 mark.\n\nFurthermore, taking a closer look at Ethereum on the daily timeframe showed that it reached the $2,000 milestone in April. Unfortunately, the upward momentum was short-lived, lasting less than six days.\n\nSince then, ETH has been unable to surpass and maintain that price range. As of this writing, it was trading at approximately $1,800, reflecting a minor gain of less than 1%.\n\nSelf-custody on the rise\n\nAs the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to fluctuate, an increasing number of holders are opting to secure their assets. Recent data from Santiment revealed a decline in the supply of BTC and ETH on exchanges.\n\nThe chart indicated that the current percentage of BTC supply on exchanges was at its lowest since December 2017. Similarly, the percentage of ETH supply on exchanges was the lowest since 2015.\n\nAs of this writing, BTC’s supply on exchanges was approximately 10%, while ETH’s supply was around 5%. This decline in supply on exchanges could signal an anticipated price uptrend and future bull run for both cryptocurrencies.\n\nCurrent Netflow and Funding Rate\n\nAnalyzing the Netflow data of Ethereum on CryptoQuant showed that there has yet to be a substantial flow in recent days. However, there were more outflows than inflows during this period. The Netflow was negative at the time of writing, indicating an outflow of over 14,000 ETH.\n\nOn the other hand, Bitcoin has experienced a more notable flow in recent days, but similar to Ethereum, the dominant trend has been outflows per CryptoQuant. As of this writing, the Netflow for Bitcoin was negative, although there had been minor positive flows on previous days.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nInvestors have maintained a bullish sentiment even with the notable movement of ETH and BTC off exchanges. Data from Coinglass revealed that funding rates for BTC and ETH have consistently been positive across various exchanges.\n\nThis suggested that most investors were placing bets on a future price increase for both cryptocurrencies.'}, {'id': 16, 'time': 'Sun, 21 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "DigiToads' TOADS outpaces ethereum in the ongoing presale - crypto.news", 'content': 'DigiToads is a new crypto project with a toad as its mascot.

However, investors are considering the project because TOADS offer more utilities than other meme coins. Moreover, TOADS is growing rapidly, attracting short and long term investors.\n\nYou might also like: PEPE losing investors after NFT scam while capital and interest flow to DigiToads\n\nAlready, over 92% of TOADS allocated for stage six of the presale have been sold. At this phase, early adopters are in profits, outpacing gains posted by top crypto coins like ethereum (ETH).\n\nDigiToads‘ success\n\nThe ongoing presale of DigiToads’ native token is proving successful.\n\nThe project has raised over $3.5m from selling 223,956,305 TOADS out of the allocated 272.5m for the project’s presale while still in stage 6, called “Lilypad 6”.\n\nConsidering this level of demand, more investors appear to be choosing the token and adding them to their respective portfolios. Since presale prices will be gradually increased through to stage 10, those who consider and buy the token in the early stages could reap more returns.\n\nDigiToads is adopting innovative technology and using a revolutionary approach to combine blockchain with real-world data, unlocking new possibilities for decentralized apps (dapps).\n\nIt also has a play-to-earn (P2E) game “Toad-Cade”. This P2E model could appeal to a bigger demographic of gaming enthusiasts that want to earn yield while playing. Subsequently, this may encourage players to use TOADS to access the game that’s based on feeding, nurturing, strengthening, and competing with digital toads.\n\nSince TOADS is a deflationary token, DigiToads’ roadmap suggests that the overall supply will gradually decline as more tokens are burnt. This strategy could support TOADS prices over time thereby appealing to investors willing to accumulate and HODL.\n\nIn addition, DigiToads hosts a monthly trade competition called “Toad vs. Toad.” These trading competitions will help the DigiToads team find good traders who will contribute to the DigiToads decentralized exchange (DEX), The Trading Post. The DEX will launch soon after the project builds a vibrant community of ToadVestors.\n\nWinners of the monthly trading contest will receive Platinum TOADS. By the end of the year, 12 winners will have been selected.\n\nPlatinum TOADS owners can access one-twelfth of the TOADS treasury and 10% of all profits made on each trade.\n\n>> Buy DigiToads Now <<\n\nEthereum price action\n\nEthereum was trading at $1,797.20 on May 14, 2023, a more than 50% drop from the $4,400 recorded at some point in 2021.\n\nLosses were even deeper in 2022 due to the crypto winter.\n\nHowever, prices has since recovered, bottoming up, catalyzed by the collapse of FTX in November 2022; an event that lifted other top coins, including bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH).\n\nConclusion\n\nAs ETH prices slowly recover, trends show that investors, including retailers and whales, are gravitating towards potential projects that can post big returns in 2023. The surging demand for TOADS even before its official listing, as a result, has grabbed the attention of investors.\n\nThe early success of DigiToads and growing market demand for its native token in the presale phase has made crypto experts believe this project can outperform top coins, including ETH, in the weeks and months to come.\n\nFor more information on DigiToads, visit the website, join the presale, or join the community for regular updates.\n\nDisclosure: This content is provided by a third party. crypto.news does not endorse any product mentioned on this page.

Will DogeMiyagi ($MIYAGI) become the meme market leader?\n\nFurthermore, would cryptocurrencies in presale garner greater interest because they are untouched by the current market trend?\n\nThe Great Crypto Cliffhanger: Bitcoin’s Precarious Position and Ethereum’s Fate in the Balance\n\nAs the crypto world holds its breath, Bitcoin’s (BTC) price is perched precariously on a stable support level, making it a compelling opportunity for eager buyers to accumulate. After several failed attempts to break free and soar to new heights, BTC is back at the notorious $27,000 barrier, like a stubborn explorer refusing to surrender to the depths.\n\nOh, the drama! After seven days of relentless selling, Bitcoin’s price has finally taken a break from the madness, settling down for a cosy consolidation around the familiar $27,000 support level. It’s like the calm after a stormy affair, where BTC is catching its breath, unsure of its following path.\n\nWill it sweep Monday’s low at $26,694, teasing us with a swift recovery and reclaiming its support level throne? Or will it succumb to the temptation of becoming a resistance barrier, shattering our bullish dreams and potentially triggering a merciless correction to $25,290 and $23,905 levels?

Picture this: a bearish divergence sells signal on the daily chart, unfolding its treacherous formation between January 14 and May 13, leaving unsuspecting investors in disbelief.\n\nStory continues\n\nLike a magician revealing their trickery, this wicked move sent ETH on a 17% freefall, leaving it gasping for air at the measly $1,735 mark. But fear not! Hope lies in the mystical realm of critical support floors, and ETH’s saviour awaits at the sacred $1,705 level. If it can summon the strength to bounce back from this abyss, a glimmer of light might shine through, guiding it on a heroic journey towards the superb $2,028 destination.\n\nBut patience, dear investors, patience! Remember, the tale of Ethereum’s fate is yet to be written, and it eagerly awaits Bitcoin’s proclamation of direction. In this mesmerising world of cryptocurrencies, where fortunes rise and fall with the flicker of a digital heartbeat, one thing remains clear: the intricate dance of Bitcoin sets the stage for its companion, Ethereum.\n\nThe Rise of Meme Coins: Exploring the Allure and Potential of DogeMiyagi in the Crypto Market\n\nThe general public is drawn to meme coins because of the possibility of rapid returns and the entertaining and dynamic communities surrounding them. While meme currencies lack the technological complexity and use cases of Bitcoin and Ethereum, their popularity stems from their ease of usage, low cost, and viral growth potential. The current crackdown on mainstream cryptocurrencies may have created a void that meme coins might fill, luring buyers looking for new investment possibilities.\n\nThe presale of meme coins is another important factor in their success.\n\nDuring a market downturn, presale cryptocurrencies provide a unique opportunity for investors. These new currencies are introduced through presales or initial coin offers (ICOs), which allow investors to purchase tokens before they are available on the general market. Because market trends do not yet influence presale coins, they enable investors to enter the market at an early stage.\n\nOverall, coins, let us welcome its highness DogeMiyagi to the meme market podium!\n\nMIYAGI is one of the most recent meme currencies, and it has the potential to become the market leader.\n\nThrough thorough audits, DogeMiyagi proudly emphasises its dedication to identity verification and risk assessment.

The Ethereum co-founder, however, warned against such a notion and explained,\n\n“It is natural for application-layer projects to attempt such a strategy, and indeed such ideas are often simply conceived without an appreciation of the risks, but its result can easily become very misaligned with the goals of the community as a whole.”\n\nIn the latest blog post titled, ‘Don’t overload Ethereum’s consensus,’ Buterin offered some potential solutions to address risks such as price oracles, either “not-quite-cryptoeconomic decentralized oracles” or validator-voting-based oracles that explicitly commit to their emergency recovery strategies being something other than appealing to L1 consensus.\n\nButerin also pointed out that more complex truth oracles could be counted as a solution as the focus would be on reporting facts more subjective than price. He added that it would be “some kind of decentralized court system” built on a not-quite-cryptoeconomic DAO.\n\nMinimizing reliance on cross-chain bridges is also important since these protocols have become an attractive target for malicious entities.\n\nMinimalism\n\nButerin said that any expansion of the “duties” of Ethereum’s consensus triggers an increase in costs, complexities as well as risks of running a validator. He argued that preserving the chain’s minimalism should be the focus which can be achieved by supporting uses of re-staking that do not look like slippery slopes to extending the role of Ethereum consensus.\n\nHe also highlighted the importance of helping developers find alternate strategies to achieve their security goals.'}, {'id': 2, 'time': 'Mon, 22 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Vitalik Buterin warns against overloading Ethereum consensus layer - Cointelegraph', 'content': "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has published a lengthy blog post warning of the dangers of “stretching” Ethereum’s consensus past its core functions of validating blocks and securing the network.\n\nEthereum consensus is the process whereby blocks are validated by the proof-of-stake mechanism implemented in September 2022 with “the Merge.”\n\nIn a May 21 blog post titled “Don’t overload Ethereum’s consensus,” Buterin warned that using Ethereum’s network consensus for other things could bring “high systemic risks to the ecosystem and should be discouraged and resisted.”\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder was essentially promoting the preservation of the blockchain’s minimalism.\n\nButerin noted that over the years, a number of proposals or ideas had floated around that suggested using the Ethereum social consensus for other purposes, such as price and data oracles, re-staking initiatives and using layer-1 soft forks to recover layer-2 projects should they have issues.\n\n“There is a natural urge to try to extend the blockchain’s core with more and more functionality because the blockchain’s core has the largest economic weight and the largest community watching it, but each such extension makes the core itself more fragile.”\n\nButerin said that a certain subset of these techniques could bring “high systemic risks” to the ecosystem, such as bugs or an intentional 51% attack.\n\nSome high-risk examples include creating ETH/USD price oracles in which ETH (ETH) holders or validators can be bribed to vote on, which may result in a “fork out the bad participants' money” if there is disagreement.\n\nHowever, he acknowledged a need for better oracles, proposing a case-by-case approach because various problems are “inherently so different” from each other.\n\nOverall, Buterin said that any expansion of the “duties” of Ethereum's consensus increases the costs, complexities, and risks of running a validator.\n\nRelated: Buterin weighs in on zk-EVMs’ impact on decentralization and security\n\nApplication-layer projects “taking actions that risk increasing the ‘scope’ of blockchain consensus to anything other than verifying the core Ethereum protocol rules,” should be treated with caution, he said, summarizing:\n\n“We should instead preserve the chain’s minimalism, support uses of re-staking that do not look like slippery slopes to extending the role of Ethereum consensus, and help developers find alternate strategies to achieve their security goals.”\n\nThe Ethereum consensus mechanism switched from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake in September last year.

However, it is crucial to note that Ethereum, as the second-largest market capitalization asset, has displayed resilience and exhibited signs of strength during this period.\n\nThis stability in Ethereum’s price suggests a certain level of confidence and investor trust in the asset. It signifies that despite the overall market fluctuations, Ethereum has managed to hold its ground, attracting potential investors and maintaining a relatively steady value.\n\nWith this in mind, Finbold has consulted the machine learning algorithms over at the cryptocurrency analytics and prediction platform Price Predictions, which set the price of ETH at $1,792 on June 1, 2023, according to the latest data accessed on May 22.\n\nETH 30-day price forecast.

These validators finalize blocks every 6.4 minutes on the Ethereum network. The process is secured and sophisticated so that the chain recovers to the correct state even if a bug hits or a 51% attack occurs.\n\nStretching the consensus system for other purposes can introduce “high systemic risks to the ecosystem and should be discouraged and resisted,” Buterin wrote. He added:\n\n“Dual-use of validator staked ETH, while it has some risks, is fundamentally fine, but attempting to “recruit” Ethereum social consensus for your application’s own purposes is not.”\n\nButerin further explained that so long as a protocol kept its losses contained to the validators and users in case of a complete collapse, it is “low-risk.” But, if the protocol is designed in a way that the original Ethereum chain has to fork or reorganize to solve its problems, then it is “high-risk, and I argue that we should strongly resist all attempts to create such expectations,” he wrote.\n\nThere could be a middle ground, Buterin suggested, if protocols in the low-risk category incentivize participants to slide into the higher-risk category. He also suggested using SchellingCoin-style techniques, a consensus mechanism where participants are asked to guess the average value of a certain parameter, like price, and those whose guesses are closest to the average are rewarded.\n\nWhat are the risks of extending Ethereum’s consensus?\n\nAccording to Buterin:\n\n“As soon as a blockchain tries to “hook in” to the outside world, the outside world’s conflicts start to impact on the blockchain too.”\n\nIn other words, if Ethereum validators start voting on things like price oracles that include the currency of a country in the middle of a political crisis, it could lead to a split of the Ethereum chain.\n\nButerin added:\n\n“…once a blockchain starts incorporating real-world price indices as a layer-1 protocol feature, it could easily succumb to interpreting more and more real-world information.”\n\nFurthermore, introducing Layer 1 price indices could change blockchains from neutral technical platforms to explicitly financial tools. This, in turn, could attract legal trouble for blockchains, Buterin said.\n\nFurthermore, it is not just price indices that pose a risk. Buterin wrote:'}, {'id': 1, 'time': 'Mon, 22 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Vitalik Buterin urges caution when it comes to re-staking on Ethereum - The Block', 'content': "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin expressed concerns about overcomplicating the Ethereum consensus mechanism beyond its original design, specifically in terms of re-staking.\n\nIn a new blog post, Buterin voiced reservations about initiatives that could unnecessarily introduce risks into the ecosystem and complicate the roles of Ethereum validators beyond their primary duty of verifying the core protocol rules. Buterin was concerned about re-staking, a mechanism being developed by Eigen Layer, among others, which broadens the responsibilities of Ethereum validators to include securing external chains. He was worried that re-staking might introduce risks that could affect the safety of the network.\n\n“We should tread lightly when application-layer projects aim to extend the ‘scope’ of blockchain consensus beyond the validation of essential Ethereum protocol rules,” Buterin stated in the post.\n\nIn Ethereum’s proof-of-stake model, validators are selected based on the number of ether they hold and are willing to stake. The network has the largest validator set among all proof-of-stake chains, both in terms of the number of validator entities and the total value of staked ether, some 18 million ETH (~$34 billion). This considerable size has prompted the development of systems to leverage this network security to secure third-party chains. However, Buterin advocated for a cautious approach.\n\nThe risk of re-staking\n\nButerin noted that while re-staking can be used for low-risk purposes, there are situations where it could compromise the mainnet’s security, such as when Ethereum validators face slashing on third-party chains. Slashing is a punitive measure for validators who engage in undesirable activities, like improperly maintaining their stake or incorrectly processing transactions.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\n“We should instead preserve the chain’s minimalism and support uses of re-staking that do not seem like slippery slopes towards extending the role of Ethereum consensus,” Buterin suggested.\n\nButerin’s comments elicited responses from Sreeram Kannan, co-founder of Eigen Layer. Kannan agreed with Buterin’s analysis and acknowledged that Eigen Layer should avoid building complex financial primitives with the help of re-staking, as they “can spiral out of control.” Nevertheless, he stated that re-staking can be used for “low-risk” scenarios.\n\nKannan agreed that Eigen Layer can extend the functionality of validators beyond Ethereum but said these should be developed without the need for “slashing,” which would introduce unnecessary complexity. He further emphasized that Eigen Layer is cautious about not impacting Ethereum’s security in any way, aligning with Buterin’s blog post.\n\nButerin discussed a 2015 proposal from Martin Köppelmann, the co-founder of Gnosis, for an “ultimate oracle,” deriving security from ETH stake. In the context of smart contracts, oracles are vital as they supply off-chain data. However, Buterin said that if the security of these data feeds were intertwined with Ethereum’s stake, it might contribute to increased complexity.\n\nButerin suggested that such expanded roles or “duties” added to Ethereum’s consensus mechanism could magnify the challenges and risks involved in operating as a validator. He emphasized, “Validators are required to exert significant human effort in terms of monitoring, running, and updating additional software to ensure their adherence to any newly implemented protocols.”"}]

*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the current market trend for ETH is bullish, with indicators pointing towards potential price increases in the near future. The high level of activity on the network, stable number of unique addresses, and the buy trend on the MACD signal all support a positive outlook for ETH.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights some cautionary notes from Vitalik Buterin regarding the expansion of Ethereum's core functionality and potential short-term bearish sentiment in the market. While these warnings should be taken into consideration, it is important to note that long-term strategies based on on-chain data have been effective in navigating the volatile ETH market successfully.

In reflection, it is evident that a moderately conservative trading approach that prioritizes long-term strategies and risk management is recommended. While short-term uncertainties and mixed signals from news analyst reports can lead to profit losses, focusing on on-chain data analysis for informed decision-making has proven to be beneficial.

Considering the synthesized reports, the overall market trend for ETH appears to be positive in the long term, despite potential short-term fluctuations. Therefore, I would recommend taking a strategic approach and maintaining a positive outlook on ETH. My trading action would be to buy ETH with a confidence level of 0.7, indicating a high level of confidence in the long-term bullish trend while also acknowledging the need for risk management.

Excluding this brief price pump, Ether’s (ETH) journey below $1,920 was initiated on April 21, over 30 days ago.\n\nOne can likely blame the Ethereum network’s $8.80 average transaction fee for investors’ diminished appetite, but the macroeconomic environment has also played an important role. On May 22, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said it is impossible to predict the outcome of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy, designed to curb inflation.\n\nAs CNN reported, Dimon added:\n\n“You’re already seeing credit tighten up because the easiest way for a bank to retain capital is not to make the next loan."\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding the United States debt ceiling standoff between Joe Biden’s administration and the U.S. Congress is the probable cause for the worsening sentiment among institutional investors toward cryptocurrencies.

Source: DefiLlama\n\nThe total value locked (TVL) in the network remained stable at 15.1 million ETH versus four weeks prior, but it is nearing the lowest levels since August 2020. As a comparison, the TVL on the BNB Smart Chain in BNB (BNB) terms was essentially flat in the same period, while TRX (TRX) deposits on the Tron network declined by 12%.\n\nBNB Smart Chain flips Ethereum’s lead in DEX volume\n\nEthereum has historically been the absolute leader in decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes, but it all changed in the week ending May 21.\n\nWeekly DEX volume by chain.

The network’s scalability issues have resulted in high gas fees, making it difficult for small investors to participate.\n\nEthereum’s Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism has also been criticized for inefficiency. On the other hand, Ethereum’s supporters argue that the network’s transition to Proof of Stake (PoS) will address these issues and ensure its longevity.\n\nDuring the cryptocurrency frenzy, skeptics are raising eyebrows and questioning the future of Ethereum and Bitcoin.\n\nThe debate heats up with critics voicing concerns about their viability, potential manipulation, environmental impact, and outdated technology.\n\nDiscover the eight reasons why some experts believe these digital assets may become relics and explore the emerging alternatives that could reshape the investment landscape.\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum: Proof of Work vs. Proof of Stake\n\nEthereum’s PoW algorithm requires miners to solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and create new blocks. This process consumes significant energy and has been criticized for contributing to climate change.\n\nEthereum 2.0, the network’s upcoming upgrade, will transition to PoS, eliminating the need for miners and reducing energy consumption. PoS allows network participants to secure the network by staking their cryptocurrency, with rewards proportional to their stake.\n\nIs Ethereum dead?\n\nDespite the criticism surrounding Ethereum, the network remains the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The Ethereum network’s decentralization and its role as a platform for decentralized applications (dapps) have contributed to its popularity.\n\nHowever, Ethereum’s high gas fees have made it difficult for small investors and dapp developers to use the network. The network’s scalability issues have also resulted in slower transaction times, further hindering its adoption.\n\nWhat the Experts Say About Ethereum’s Future\n\nSource: Business Today\n\nMany experts believe that Ethereum’s future is bright, despite its current challenges.\n\nThe network’s transition to PoS will improve its scalability and energy efficiency.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum’s role as a platform for dapps and decentralized finance (DeFi) has attracted significant investment and development. Some experts predict that Ethereum’s market capitalization could exceed that of Bitcoin in the future.\n\nThe Relationship Between Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. While Bitcoin is primarily used as a store of value and a medium of exchange, Ethereum’s platform enables the creation of decentralized applications and smart contracts.\n\nEthereum’s supporters argue that its versatility and potential for innovation make it a more valuable asset than Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin’s first-mover advantage and wider adoption have contributed to its dominance in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nEthereum vs. Competitors: Where Does Ethereum Stand?\n\nEthereum faces competition from other blockchain platforms, including Binance Smart Chain, Polkadot, and Cardano.\n\nWhile these platforms offer similar functionality to Ethereum, they have different approaches to scalability and consensus.\n\nBinance Smart Chain, for example, uses a delegated proof of stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism, while Cardano uses a proof of stake (PoS) mechanism. Ethereum’s supporters argue that its established network effect and development community give it an advantage over its competitors.\n\nEthereum’s Potential for long-term growth\n\nDespite its current challenges, Ethereum’s potential for long-term growth remains strong. The network’s transition to PoS is expected to improve its energy efficiency and scalability, making it more accessible to small investors and dapp developers.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum’s role as a platform for DeFi and NFTs (non-fungible tokens) has attracted significant investment and development. Some experts predict that Ethereum’s market capitalization could exceed that of Bitcoin in the future.\n\nWill Ethereum recover in 2023? Examining the Possibilities\n\nPredicting the future of any cryptocurrency is challenging, and Ethereum is no exception.\n\nHowever, many experts believe that Ethereum’s transition to PoS and the continued development of the network’s infrastructure could lead to a significant recovery in the coming years.\n\nAdd...'}]

Overall, the market trend for Ethereum may experience short-term challenges but could see growth in the long run.

In reflecting on recent trading performance, it is evident that prioritizing long-term strategies based on on-chain data analysis has been effective in navigating the volatile ETH market successfully. This approach has led to positive returns and a high level of confidence in the market trend. However, relying solely on news analyst reports has sometimes resulted in profit losses due to short-term uncertainties and mixed signals. Moving forward, it is crucial to continue emphasizing on-chain data analysis for making informed trading decisions and balancing risk management with growth opportunities. Key trends in the current cryptocurrency market, such as bullish indicators for ETH in the long term and potential short-term fluctuations, suggest that a moderately conservative trading approach is warranted to manage risk appropriately while capitalizing on growth opportunities.

*** TRADER RESPONSE ***
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the market trend for ETH appears to be bullish in the long term. The high level of activity, increasing number of unique addresses, and consistently high total value transferred indicate a growing interest in ETH despite the sell signal from the macd_signal.

On the other hand, the news analyst report presents a mixed outlook for Ethereum in the short term, with concerns over price stagnation, reduced demand for decentralized finance, and bearish indicators. However, the long-term potential for growth is highlighted through developments such as the transition to Proof of Stake and network improvements.

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that prioritizing long-term strategies based on on-chain data analysis has been effective in navigating the volatile ETH market successfully. While short-term challenges may exist, the overall market trend for Ethereum suggests growth in the long run.

Considering the synthesized reports and the emphasis on long-term strategies, I would take a moderately conservative approach to trading ETH. Therefore, my trading action would be 0.5, reflecting a moderate level of confidence in the long-term bullish trend of ETH while also acknowledging potential short-term challenges. This decision aims to manage risk appropriately and capitalize on growth opportunities in the cryptocurrency market.

This grand event is being held exactly 2 years since YAYO Corporation first debuted by raising $600,000 for the $YAYO Coin ILO in May 2021. This bridge comes after a remarkable display of market dominance on Canto\'s native marketplace, Alto, where YAYO NFTs have significantly outperformed all other assets.\n\nThe YAYO Man is an archetype representing various facets of masculinity, culture, industry, and themes within both fiction and history that molds the minds and hearts of young men across the world.\n\nThe YAYO NFT initially launched on the Canto chain for a mint price of 250 $CANTO, approximately $100 USD. After successfully minting out in mid-April, YAYO proceeded to completely outperform every other NFT project on the Canto ecosystem, exceeding the marketcap and floor price of Canto\'s premiere official project "Canto Longnecks" and consistently topping the 24-hour volume rankings every single day. Most recently, the YAYO NFT shot past the 10,000 $CANTO floor mark, achieving a 4,000% return on the mint price and placing it in the number one slot as the highest performing Canto NFT of all time, exceeding every other project in price, volume, and unique owners of all-time.\n\nDespite initial lower-than-expected support on Canto, YAYO NFT\'s success story is a testament to its inherent value and powerful design. The collection of 4000 figures, complete with vehicles, weapons, outfits, and backgrounds, carries meticulously accurate metadata labels mirroring real-world brands, makes, and models. The artistry, citation depth, and tasteful design make YAYO NFTs a prized asset for collectors and enthusiasts.\n\nAfter successfully reaching the number one spot on Canto and hitting every milestone the YAYO Corporation set out to achieve, they are now launching their planned Ethereum bridge on the two-year anniversary of their initial launch to find bigger fish to fry, in a one-way opt-in process which is set to further enhance YAYO\'s presence and value in the wider NFT ecosystem.\n\nStory continues\n\nAbout YAYO Corporation: The Yoshimoto Atlantic Yield Optimization Corporation is the premiere project of the Remilia Corporation, an iconic art collective and powerhouse in the fields of technology and finance.

That’s a stark contrast to withdrawal queues just last month, which stood at roughly 17,500.\n\nThe surge of new validators has helped drive the active validator count to a new high of nearly 584,000, data shows. This number has more than made up for the transient decrease in complete withdrawals that occurred when withdrawals were initially introduced.\n\nAs the number of active validators approaches the 589,000 mark, an internal protocol parameter, known as the Churn Limit, will rise, allowing for the daily activation of an extra 225 validators.\n\nHowever, even with this increased pace, individuals or staking pools spinning up new validators to join the queue today would still need just over a month to become active, Coin Metrics noted.\n\nLiquid staking tokens predicted to fuel staking value\n\nA budding narrative in the decentralized finance (DeFi) world underscores the escalating demand for Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs).\n\nThese tokens, representative of staked assets, bring a new level of liquidity to the traditionally illiquid PoS model by allowing staked assets to participate in DeFi applications while still contributing to the network’s security.\n\nThey provide a bridge between staking and DeFi by offering liquid tokens that represent staked ETH, allowing holders to freely interact with DeFi protocols while still earning staking rewards.\n\nThe growing prominence of LSTs within DeFi is intricately linked to Ethereum’s staking ecosystem. Behind every LST, there is a staking operation, providing the required security and validation for the Ethereum network.\n\nSome of the established decentralized players are jockeying for market share, such as Lido DAO (LDO), Frax (FXS) and Rocket Pool (RPL), alongside centralized staking providers such as Coinbase, and a slew of others, with new offerings cropping up regularly post-Shapella.\n\nIn essence, the explosion of LSTs within DeFi implies a parallel increase in Ethereum staking activity. As the role of LSTs becomes more integral to DeFi’s future, it may inadvertently fuel the demand for ETH, Blockworks was previously told.\n\nDon’t miss the next big story – join our free daily newsletter.'}, {'id': 6, 'time': 'Wed, 24 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Ethereum is 'woefully undervalued' but growing more powerful: DeFi Dad, Hall of Flame - Cointelegraph", 'content': 'DeFi Dad has 152,100 Twitter followers.

After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing volatility, with mixed signals such as fluctuating open prices and gas prices, as well as a potential shift towards a bearish trend indicated by the MACD signal. On the other hand, the news analyst report paints a more positive picture for ETH, highlighting developments such as the permission of retail crypto trading in Hong Kong and the increase in Ethereum staking activity.

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that while short-term news can provide valuable insights, long-term strategies based on on-chain data analysis have been more effective in navigating the volatile ETH market successfully.

That’s because Ethereum’s underlying software is seen as more versatile and better able to handle bursts of activity without getting clogged up and slowing down. Now Bitcoin finds itself playing host to crypto’s latest speculative frenzy, a frog-branded “memecoin” called Pepe, putting the original crypto network’s technology under strain.\n\nMemecoins are digital tokens depicted with an image — often an animated character or animal — that can quickly gain notoriety and soar in value. Although they have little practical use, they can draw an exuberant community of followers who hoard or trade them. (The name takes its cue from so-called meme stocks, such as Gamestop Corp., that were seized upon by retail traders during the pandemic and driven to stratospheric valuations based on social media chatter.) There are hundreds of memecoins, some worth almost nothing, others with market values of $100 million or more. Investors often leap upon a newly minted memecoin when it starts trading on a digital exchange such as Coinbase or Robinhood. Others pile in after them for fear of missing out. One famous memecoin, Dogecoin, ascended to stardom when Elon Musk tweeted memes based on the coin, which inspired a number of dog-themed memecoins such as Shiba Inu.'}, {'id': 6, 'time': 'Thu, 25 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'What Happens to Bitcoin and Ethereum If the US Defaults on Its Debt? - Decrypt', 'content': "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe United States is barreling toward a date that could have historic consequences for global markets, running the risk of its first-ever debt default. It's a potential black swan event that could have an outsized impact on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the rest of the crypto market.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned weeks ago that the government would soon run out of funds if the debt ceiling isn’t suspended or raised—possibly as early as June 1. If lawmakers remain deadlocked and can’t come to an agreement on spending, Washington won’t be able to pay its bills, she said.\n\nSimilar standoffs over the debt ceiling have rattled markets in the past, like a prolonged disagreement over the debt ceiling that sent the S&P 500 tumbling 16% in 2011, startling investors before a resolution was reached.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis time around, Wall Street has yawned. The S&P 500 is down less than 1% since Yellen issued her sobering remarks on May 1. However, Bitcoin has fallen more than 7% and Ethereum is down nearly 3% during the same period, according to CoinGecko.\n\nAmerica's “X-date”\n\nTypically, debt ceiling debacles create more noise than market-moving news, Amberdata’s Director of Derivatives Greg Magadini told Decrypt—but he acknowledged that a U.S. debt default is far from off the table.\n\n“It feels like a pretty intense game of chicken right now,” he said. “And given how crazy things have gone in the past couple of years, I think anything is possible.”\n\nIn the event that the government defaults on its debts, risk assets like stocks and crypto would face short-term pain, Magadini said. He explained that’s because a drop in the quality of government-backed debt would likely raise borrowing costs, counterintuitively increasing its yield and strengthening the dollar compared to other assets.\n\nSimilarly, the dollar could strengthen during a U.S. default as American traders tend to onshore their dollars—swapping foreign currencies and assets for the greenback—during risk-off events, CoinShares’ Head of Research James Butterfill told Decrypt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n“Technically speaking, the dollar should sell off in the event of a default, but it won't because people tend to onshore their dollars in periods of market stress,” he said. “The dollar might actually strengthen, perversely, because people are getting worried, and that actually won’t be so great for Bitcoin.”\n\nButterfill envisions the dollar will strengthen and Bitcoin will slide as the U.S. approaches what the White House has described as America's “X-date,” the official date at which the government can no longer pay its bills.\n\n“This is a really complicated scenario,” Butterfill said, noting he doesn’t think a default is likely. “It’s not that obvious what exactly will happen.”\n\nBitcoin May Bounce\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum could react differently in the event of a default, Amberdata’s Magadini said. Bitcoin may bounce alongside gold after an initial slide—as a check on government-issued currency—while Ethereum would likely remain depressed alongside tech stocks, he said.\n\nThe sentiment was echoed by Genesis’ Co-Head of Trading Gordon Grant, who told Decrypt that Bitcoin has more upside than Ethereum if the government can no longer meet its debt obligations, but both coins would face pressure initially.\n\n“Maybe there's an initial wick down, as risk assets get absolutely trounced, because the stock market is going to get decimated,” he said. “But Bitcoin is probably going higher.”\n\nFor Ethereum, Grant said that the second largest crypto by market cap is often tied to indexes tracking tech stocks like the NASDAQ, making it likely to underperform compared to Bitcoin if a default takes place.\n\n“It doesn't matter whether I think that that's a fair comparison,” he said, noting that that’s how certain models trade the relationship between things like the NASDAQ and Ethereum. “So, we would tend to expect underperformance of Ethereum.”\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSVB and Sausage\n\nAs an example of how crypto has performed during recent risk-off events, Grant pointed to Bitcoin’s outsized gains compared to Ethereum in the wake of several bank collapses in March, including Silicon Valley Bank. However, he noted that there’s zero data to suggest how cryptocurrencies could react if the government defaults for the first time in history.\n\nBoth Grant and Magadini highlighted increased activity in the options market for Bitcoin as a potential default draws closer, saying it suggests that traders—mostly institutional ones—are betting the coin will see increased volatility.\n\nAt the end of the day, Grant said he’s confident that lawmakers will exhaust their differences on Capitol Hill and reach an agreement like they always have. But, pointing to the logic of Bloomberg’s Tom Keene, Grant said the bigger question is whether events like these become more common in an ever-more-polariz..."}, {'id': 42, 'time': 'Thu, 25 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Unlocking the Potential: Best LSD Crypto Tokens to Add to Your Portfolio - The Economic Times', 'content': "Thanks to the recent Ethereum Shanghai upgrade, liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) have become the latest trend in the decentralized finance space (DeFi), offering stakers unconventional ways to unlock liquidity for their staked crypto assets and earn additional yields.\n\nLiquid staking derivatives are gaining momentum across the Ethereum network and have the potential to dominate other ecosystems, including major layer-1 blockchains like Avalanche and Polygon.\n\nRecent data from DeFiLlama shows that approximately $17.99 billion is currently locked up in LSDs, with Lido (currently the largest liquid staking protocol) dominating the space with approximately $11.95 billion total value locked (TVL).\n\nFollowing the major ethereum upgrade (also known as the Shanghai or Shapella upgrade), there has been a sharp rise in interest in LSDs, which has led to a surge in cash flow in DeFi and made staking more accessible to a lot of people who can now take advantage of both staking rewards and liquidity. The upgrade enables withdrawals from Ethereum staking contracts, significantly reducing the risk of holding staked Ethereum (stETH).\n\nWhat are liquid staking derivatives (LSDs)?\n\nLiquid Staking Derivatives (or Liquid Staking Tokens) are a unique kind of token that allows stakers to earn yield without losing the liquidity of their staked assets. These liquid tokens can be used in various ways; they can be sold, traded or used in Defi applications just like regular ETH.Staking tokens in proof-of-stake blockchains means locking tokens as collateral to secure the network and earn rewards, however, due to the lock-up nature, these tokens become illiquid.\n\nThe Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade Revolution\n\nAfter the merge in September 2022, ethereum blockchain successfully swapped from Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism. By moving from PoW to PoS, the Ethereum blockchain now relies on validators instead of miners to run it.\n\nSince the launch of Ethereum's Beacon Chain in December 2020, the first phase of the PoS transition, individuals could stake their ETH and serve as validators to process transactions and secure the network. To become a validator, stakers needed a specialized hardware and at least 32 ETH stake to run nodes themselves and receive rewards in blocks. However, they were unable to unstake their tokens and withdraw their rewards. Thanks to the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade, validators can now unstake their staked ETH and withdraw their rewards.\n\nWhy are LSD tokens on the Rise?\n\nThe recent upgrade includes a code referred to as EIP 4895, which allows Beacon Chain staked ETH withdrawals, enabling a 1:1 exchange of staked Ether for Ether. With this development, ETH holders can now stake their tokens through liquid staking pools to generate yields, thus increasing the demand for LSDs and triggering rapid growth in DeFi TVL.\n\nLiquid staking derivatives solve the problem of capital inefficiency by providing users with a liquid and usable token representing their staked asset. They also eliminate the 32 ETH entry barrier, enabling anyone to stake any amount of ETH they can afford in exchange for additional yields.\n\nBest LSD Crypto Tokens In 2023\n\nLSD tokens have quickly become the biggest crypto trend in 2023. As such, an increasing number of DeFi protocols have rolled out to offer a more flexible way to stake and earn by providing LSDs.\n\nCurrently, 18.5 million ETH (~33.40 billion) are being staked in liquid staking pools. The annual percentage rate (APR) for staking ETH currently sits at around 8.98% today.\n\nAs Ethereum staking ratio increases, the use cases for liquid staking protocols and their tokens will also increase. Here are some of the best LSD protocols and their tokens for ETH holders looking to earn yield through staking.\n\n1) Lido ($LDO)\n\nAs a crypto trader, this is one of the best LSD tokens in the market to look out for. Lido is currently the largest liquid staking protocol dominating the space with an estimated $11.95 billion TVL at the time of writing. It has a market cap of about $2 billion, 85% of the total 1 billion LDO tokens are already in circulation.\n\nLido allows users to stake their ETH and earn additional rewards - with no lock ups and daily rewards. It supports Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, Terra, Kusama and Polkadot.\n\nLDO – the native utility token, is used for granting governance rights and managing fee distribution. The token is available for trading on various exchanges, with cryptocurrency and stablecoin pairs currently available.\n\nWith LSDs on the rise, LDO has the potential to offer higher annual yield and market share than other protocols.\n\n2) Rocket Pool ($RPL)\n\nRocket Pool is one of the largest decentralized Ethereum LSD protocols after the Lido protocol. The protocol aims to reduce both the capital and hardware requirements for staking on ETH 2.0, adding to the decentralization and security of Ethereum.\n\nRPL is the ERC-20 utility token of Rocket Pool, and it's u..."}]

The news articles highlight various factors that could impact the cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum. The rise of memecoins like Pepe Frog and the potential US debt default could create short-term volatility and pressure on both Bitcoin and Ethereum prices. However, the emergence of liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) following the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade presents a positive trend for Ethereum, offering new opportunities for stakers to earn additional yields and unlock liquidity.

Source: Glassnode .\n\nBitcoin’s stats show much of the same, with the cryptocurrency’s exchange balance dropping to levels not seen since March 2018 at just above 2.23 million BTC.\n\nWhy are investors leaving exchanges?\n\nA closer look at the data reveals that the majority of the decline came in November and December 2022 following the FTX collapse. The stacked balance metric from Glassnode, which shows the individual balance on each exchange, confirms that a significant portion of the decline came from FTX.\n\nAn exodus followed shortly across other major exchanges such as Binance, Kraken, and Coinbase likely due to the contagion fears that spread across the market. This was also seen in the steep spike in sales for hardware wallet providers such as Ledger and Trezor.\n\nThe latest decline in Ethereum balances on exchanges in May also coincides with a rise in staking. The amount of staked ETH surged from 19.3 million before the Shapella upgrade to 21.2 million, rising vertically since the start of May, per Nansen data.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin’s exchange balance did not decline alongside ETH during the same period, further suggesting that staking played a role in exchange withdrawals.'}, {'id': 4, 'time': 'Fri, 26 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'No ETH to trade? Ethereum exchange balance drops to a 5-year low - Cointelegraph', 'content': 'The balance of available Ether (ETH) across crypto exchanges dropped to a five-year low on May 26, bringing the total amount of Ether held on exchanges to 17.86 million. A drastic decline in the exchange supply of ETH like this has not been seen since April 2018.\n\nAccording to Glassnode data, only 14.85% of the total Ether supply is currently held on centralized exchanges, compared with the 25–26% of supply held during the 2021 bull run.\n\nThe decline in Ether exchange balances. Source: Glassnode\n\nThe drop in ETH supply began in September 2022, dropping significantly after the FTX crisis in November. Apart from a decline in the exchange balance, Ethereum wallet addresses holding more than 100 ETH have also declined to a six-month low.\n\nTwo significant events could have influenced the decline in ETH balances on centralized exchanges in the recent past. The first is the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange, prompting many to move their crypto assets from exchange wallets to self-custody wallets; the second, and most important, is the Shapella upgrade.\n\nShapella made way for thousands of validators to withdraw their staked ETH. However, contrary to popular belief, a minority of validators decided to unstake, while the majority only withdrew their staking rewards.\n\nThe movement of assets away from exchanges is considered a bullish sign, indicating traders are not looking to sell at the current price. In Ethereum’s case, re-staking ETH is the most apparent reason for the declining exchange supply.\n\nRelated: Ethereum price metrics hint that ETH might not sell off after the Shapella hard fork\n\nMajor crypto exchanges like Binance, Bitfinex, Kraken and others that supported the Shapella upgrade saw a significant outflow of ETH from their exchange wallets, leading to the current balance decline.\n\nETH withdrawal from crypto exchanges.

It then added that it is deeply engaged in studying Ethereum’s proposal ERC-4337 for digital payments.\n\nRolled out on the Ethereum mainnet in early March, ERC-4337 is a key component of VISA’s exploration, as it adds the ability for smart contracts to transact on behalf of the user.\n\nThe firm also noted that it has successfully deployed two sets of Paymaster contracts on the Ethereum Goerli testnet, a move aimed at showcasing the potential for redesigning gas fees on the blockchain to improve user convenience. Mustafa Bedawala of Visa’s crypto department observed that the firm’s first paymaster contract is focused on investigating whether users can pay transaction fees with alternative tokens, like dollar stablecoins or, potentially, CBDCs apart from ETH.\n\n“To transact on the Ethereum blockchain today, a user needs to acquire ETH to pay for gas fees; similarly, to transact on Polygon blockchain, a user needs to acquire the native token MATIC. Is there a solution that eliminates the need to accumulate a different range of native blockchain tokens solely for the purpose of paying for gas?” wrote Visa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe other paymaster contract is aimed at completely covering gas fees for user transactions, addressing a major pain point in the crypto space.\n\n“Account Abstraction offers a solution by allowing users to bypass these costs if a third party, such as a fintech wallet provider, is willing to cover them. In this case, the wallet provider or dApps can act as Paymasters, covering gas fees for users and significantly reducing friction. The ERC-4337 Paymaster concept can be a potential way to incentivize user adoption by making it free for users to transact through their wallet platform,” the firm added.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has previously expressed his longstanding interest in gas fees Account Abstraction, calling it a dream of the Ethereum developer community. Buterin recommends the use of social recovery wallets and multi-signature wallets for crypto investors to achieve self-custody of their assets.\n\nThus, with the imminent implementation of ERC-4337 and the emergence of smart contract wallets, wallet security, as well as payments, are expected to improve significantly for VISA users opening doors to wider adoption of cryptocurrencies.'}, {'id': 0, 'time': 'Fri, 26 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Dogecoin Proves It's a Serious Blockchain, Flips Ethereum Transaction Count - Blockworks", 'content': 'Dogecoin is undergoing a surge in network spam so dramatic that it’s now processing more transactions than the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nOver the past week, the memecoin network handled more than 7.9 million transactions, up nearly 11% on Ethereum’s 7.2 million and more than double Bitcoin’s count.\n\nNot bad for a chain that has handled only 30,000 daily transactions on average since 2015 — less than 5% of Ethereum’s.\n\nThe culprit is Bitcoin Ordinals. Or more precisely, opportunistic crypto fans eager to capitalize on the inscriptions hype.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals aren’t exactly the same as the NFTs you might find on Ethereum or Solana. Those non-fungible tokens are minted via smart contract and adhere to their own token standards enforced by wallets, marketplaces and other key infrastructure across Web3.\n\nOrdinals are instead defined by data “inscribed” into individual satoshis (sats for short). Sats are BTC’s smallest denomination: 0.00000001 BTC currently worth $0.00027. A craft developer recently figured out how to forever imbue sats with special properties, such as enough data to render a JPEG or DOOM clone.\n\nBRC-20 tokens — a play on Ethereum’s ERC-20 standard for run-of-the-mill tokens — quickly followed Ordinals. Hype for Bitcoin-powered altcoins and collectible sats triggered a renaissance for blockspace demand, driving up fees while pushing transaction counts and mempool backlogs to record highs.\n\nIf we consider Ordinals in the same genre of digital asset as Bored Apes, Bitcoin is now the number-two blockchain for NFTs behind Ethereum.\n\nDogecoin’s transaction count exploded past other prominent blockchains over the past few weeks\n\nDoge see, Doge do\n\nDue to similarities between Bitcoin and Dogecoin (a code fork of a code fork of Bitcoin), it didn’t take long for developers to code methods for minting Dogecoin tokens in much the same way as Ordinals and BRC-20s — except with a “D” instead of a “B.”\n\nBut Bitcoiners have multiple platforms on which traders can swap Ordinals and BRC-20s, including crypto exchange wallets. Dogecoin doesn’t.\n\nBitcoin’s BRC-20s in particular have been helped by an experimental token standard, something akin to Ethereum’s ERC-20s.\n\nThe standard set enough technical parameters so that infrastructure (wallets, marketplaces and the like) can facilitate trading and whatnot without running into headaches, like duplicate listings and overtly broken code.\n\nBRC-20 and Ordinals individually have recently made up more than half of all Bitcoin transactions, and it’s unclear just how many DRC-20-related transactions are flowing through Dogecoin right now. No tools have been built to sort DRC-20 outputs from others, which makes it difficult to quantify exactly how many Dogecoin tokens are being minted every minute.\n\nIn any case, it’s surely an impressive chunk. Multiple DRC-20 token transactions are found in practically every single block right now (which occur every one minute on average). They are easy to spot, as they usually come with a 0.001 DOGE fee attached ($0.000071).\n\nPseudonymous Dogecoin developer inevitable360 told Blockworks that they classify DRC-20 transactions like these as spam because anyone can clone or replicate the exact same token.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, there is no DRC-20 token standard for Dogecoin. So, many tokens are being minted under the same name, making it practically impossible to form a legitimate market around them.\n\nThere’s still legitimate Dogecoin activity alongside speculators minting Dogecoin tokens via the one or two wallets that support them in their current form (which have been caught boosting fees to apparently profit from the hype).\n\nThe median transaction value is nearly 77 DOGE ($5.46). If DRC-20s were truly the overwhelming majority, then that figure would be far lower.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals already have their own marketplaces\n\nIt might be spam, but it’s honest work\n\nFor what it’s worth, much of the recent Bitcoin activity has also been labeled spam: effectively worthless transactions with no reason to exist but to exist; abundant purely because creation is cheap and the potential payoff is large.\n\nGranted: Ethereum layer-2 networks such as Arbitrum and Optimism are each processing tons of transactions. More than a million per day for the former, in fact. If we add those in with Ethereum, then the blockchain dominates Dogecoin by far.\n\nEthereum fees are also high right now. High enough to apparently dissuade a portion of useless trade, particularly NFTs. But there’s something to be said for Dogecoin in this instance.\n\nMany deride Dogecoin as a joke carefully crafted to trap crypto newbies into gambling on memecoins during bull runs.\n\nThere may be some element of truth to that. But historically, Dogecoin has served as a lucrative alternative for bitcoin miners at times when mining BTC was simply not profitable. An unsung hero, in those cases.\n\nDogecoin is also merge-minable with Litecoin, allowing miners to share hash rate between the two to provi...'}]

Several analysts suggest that building a strong crypto portfolio starts with Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Avorak AI (AVRK).\n\nWhy you should hold Bitcoin\n\nWith several banks collapsing and the FED raising interest rates, the traditional financial systems are clearly unstable, and this could lead to cryptocurrencies becoming increasingly popular. Bitcoin (BTC) is the largest and most valuable cryptocurrency by market cap. It is also the first-ever cryptocurrency and has already seen massive worldwide adoption. Bitcoin (BTC) has a maximum supply of 21 million, and more than 19 million are already in circulation. And by laws of demand and supply, BTC is expected to increase in value over time. Additionally, Bitcoin is nearly a year away from its halving event, which is usually a catalyst for a spike in its value.\n\nWhat’s next for Ethereum?\n\nAfter Ethereum’s recent Shapella upgrade, many in the crypto community wonder what is next for the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. It can seem like Ethereum is always in a state of development, and that is because its team is working on what they call Ethereum 2.0. Opponents of Ethereum have often criticized the network’s scalability, pointing to its high transaction costs, slow speeds, and energy usage. Ethereum 2.0 aims to provide a more scalable network by offering safer, faster, cheaper, and more energy-efficient transactions. Analysts suggest that Ethereum’s developmental success could see its value increase significantly.\n\nAvorak AI (AVRK): Better for 100x\n\nAvorak is a new AI crypto project running on the BNB Smart Chain. The project includes a suite of AI products and services that can streamline human-led processes. For example, Avorak’s digital assistants and chatbots can enhance customer service by providing accurate and immediate answers to customers’ queries. The Avorak Trade bot can optimize the trading of any asset, including crypto, fiat, and stocks. The bot uses AI algorithms to analyze market trends, provide predictions on future prices, and find the best possible trades. The trade can be easily programmed to automate trades on multiple exchanges.\n\nAvorak’s suite of AI solutions can be used in many fields, including content creation, data analytics, online shopping, and security. AVRK is Avorak’s native utility token and functions as a credit for accessing the Avorak AI services. AVRK can be staked or traded on various centralized and decentralized exchanges once the project goes live. Avorak also distributes a share of its profits to AVRK holders through its revenue feedback system. There is a maximum supply of 40 million AVRK, and Avorak AI has burn mechanics that ensure continuous deflation of the AVRK token.\n\nEvery cryptocurrency investor seeks to find a 100X gem, that is, a coin that will skyrocket in value and turn a small investment into a fortune. Well, AVRK provides just that. Avorak has an ongoing ICO (initial coin offering) event, selling AVRK at a comparatively low price and offering a number of advantages to its investors. AI crypto is expected to generate substantial profits in 2023, and several analysts believe Avorak AI could lead this bull run once it’s launched.\n\nFor more information on Avorak AI:\n\nWebsite: https://avorak.ai\n\nBuy AVRK: https://invest.avorak.ai/register\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates'}, {'id': 19, 'time': 'Sat, 27 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Can Blockchain Technology be Used for Rural Development? - Analytics Insight', 'content': 'Explore the impact of leveraging blockchain technology for empowering rural development\n\nIn recent years, blockchain technology has gained significant attention for its potential to revolutionize various sectors. While often associated with cryptocurrencies, the underlying technology offers much more. One promising application lies in rural development, where blockchain can empower marginalized communities by enhancing transparency, efficiency, and trust. This article explores the transformative potential of blockchain technology for rural development and presents a compelling example of its successful implementation.\n\nBlockchain for Transparent Land Governance:\n\nLand governance is a critical aspect of rural development, as it directly impacts access to resources and livelihoods. Unfortunately, many rural areas suffer from insecure land tenure systems, leading to disputes, corruption, and exclusion. Blockchain technology can address these challenges by providing transparent and immutable land registries. Through decentralized finance and tamper-proof databases, land ownership records can be securely stored, ensuring trust among stakeholders. For instance, Bitland, a blockchain-based land registry in Ghana, has successfully enabled small-scale farmers to secure their land rights, reducing disputes and unlocking access to credit and other development opportunities.\n\nEnhancing Supply Chain Management\n\nBlockchain technology can transform the supply chain management of agricultural products, benefiting both farmers and consumers. By creating a transparent and immutable record of every stage of the supply chain, from production to distribution, blockchain ensures that the quality and authenticity of products can be verified. This is particularly crucial for rural communities that heavily rely on agriculture as their primary source of income. For example, coffee farmers in remote regions can use blockchain to track the journey of their coffee beans, ensuring fair prices and minimizing the risk of fraud throughout the supply chain. This not only improves the farmers’ income but also assures consumers of the product’s origin and quality.\n\nSmart Contracts and Agricultural Insurance\n\nSmart contracts, powered by blockchain technology, enable the automation and execution of agreements without intermediaries. In the context of empowering rural development, smart contracts can streamline agricultural insurance processes. By using predefined conditions and triggers, smart contracts can automatically trigger insurance payouts when specific events, such as crop failure due to adverse weather conditions, occur. This eliminates the need for manual claims processing and reduces administrative costs, making agricultural insurance more accessible and affordable for farmers in rural areas. Such initiatives have the potential to safeguard farmers’ livelihoods and foster sustainable agricultural practices.\n\nFinancial Inclusion and Microfinance:\n\nAccess to financial services is a crucial driver of rural development, yet many rural communities lack formal banking infrastructure. Blockchain technology can facilitate financial inclusion by enabling secure and low-cost transactions without the need for traditional banks. By leveraging mobile devices and digital identities, blockchain-based platforms empower rural populations to access microfinance services, make payments, and build credit histories. The BanQu project in Kenya exemplifies this potential, offering a blockchain-based platform that enables smallholder farmers to create a verifiable economic identity, access loans, and improve their economic prospects.\n\nCase Study: Blockchain-based Supply Chain for Rwandan Coffee\n\nOne notable example of blockchain technology’s impact on rural development is the partnership between the Rwandan government, technology company Bext360, and the coffee industry. Through a blockchain-based supply chain platform, coffee farmers in Rwanda can trace the entire journey of their beans, from harvest to export. This has significantly improved transparency and accountability in the supply chain, ensuring fair prices for farmers and enhancing the reputation of Rwandan coffee in international markets. By directly connecting farmers to buyers and facilitating instant payments, blockchain technology has empowered rural coffee farmers, contributing to poverty reduction and sustainable economic growth in the region.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nBlockchain technology holds immense promise for rural development, offering innovative solutions to address the challenges faced by marginalized communities. By providing transparent and immutable records, blockchain can enhance land governance, empowering farmers with secure land rights. Furthermore, blockchain can revolutionize agricultural supply chains, enabling fair compensation for farmers and connecting them directly with consumers. Lastly, by promoting financial inclusion and microfinance, blockchain can empower rural populatio...'}]

The news articles suggest a mixed outlook for the cryptocurrency market, with a focus on Litecoin, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. The upcoming halving of Litecoin is expected to keep the altcoin bullish, potentially leading to a breakout. However, Ethereum is facing record-high liquidations in long positions, indicating a bearish trend. Bitcoin and Ethereum are predicted to trade in a range for a while before potentially breaking down, although the plunge may take some time. Additionally, the flat prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum over the past four weeks, along with the surge in TRON and Tether, indicate a relatively stable market with some altcoins showing positive momentum. Overall, the market trend appears to be uncertain with potential for both bullish and bearish movements depending on the specific cryptocurrency.

"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing volatility, with mixed signals such as fluctuating open prices and gas prices, as well as a potential shift towards a bearish trend indicated by the MACD signal. On the other hand, the news analyst report paints a more positive picture for ETH, highlighting developments such as the permission of retail crypto trading in Hong Kong and the increase in Ethereum staking activity.

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that while short-term news can provide valuable insights, long-term strategies based on on-chain data analysis have been more effective in navigating the volatile ETH market successfully. The recommendation for a moderately conservative trading approach aligns with the need to balance risk management with growth opportunities in the cryptocurrency market.

Considering the synthesized reports, the overall market trend for ETH appears to be uncertain in the short term but bullish in the long term. Therefore, it is advisable to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains to capitalize on the potential growth opportunities in the market.

Based on this analysis, I would take a slightly bullish trading action with a confidence level of 0.3. This decision reflects a cautious approach to managing risk while still taking advantage of the long-term growth potential of ETH.
ACTION:
0.3
DAILY RETURN:
0.0028153794247129937
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing uncertainty with potential price fluctuations in the near future. The data indicates volatility in transaction costs, fluctuating total transactions and gas used, and a switching MACD signal, all pointing towards an uncertain market trend.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights both short-term volatility factors like memecoins and potential US debt default, as well as positive developments such as the emergence of liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) following the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade. This presents a mixed outlook for the market, with short-term fluctuations expected but long-term potential through LSDs.

In reflection, it is evident that prioritizing long-term strategies based on on-chain data analysis has been effective in navigating the volatile ETH market successfully. While short-term news reports can sometimes lead to mixed signals and potential profit losses, a moderately conservative trading approach that balances risk management with growth opportunities is recommended.

Considering the synthesized reports, the overall market trend for ETH appears to be uncertain in the short term but potentially positive in the long term due to developments like LSDs. Therefore, it is advisable to focus on long-term strategies and prioritize on-chain data analysis for making informed trading decisions.

Based on this analysis, I would take a slightly conservative approach and assign a trading action of 0.3, reflecting moderate confidence in the long-term positive trend for ETH while also acknowledging the short-term uncertainties in the market.

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing volatility and unpredictability. The fluctuations in gas prices, total value transferred, and MACD signals indicate a lack of clear direction in the market trend.

The exploration of smart contracts for payments by VISA further highlights the growing interest in Ethereum.

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a long-term strategy based on on-chain data analysis is crucial in navigating the current market conditions successfully. By prioritizing risk management and growth opportunities, traders can capitalize on the potential for increased demand and price appreciation in the future. It is important to monitor key trends such as transaction costs, total transactions, and MACD signals, as well as upcoming developments like liquid staking derivatives and network upgrades.

In conclusion, the overall market trend for ETH appears to be positive in the long term, despite short-term fluctuations and uncertainty. Therefore, a moderately conservative trading approach is recommended to manage risk effectively while taking advantage of long-term growth opportunities in the cryptocurrency market.

The attack resulted in the loss of 4,000 Ether (ETH), worth approximately $7.5 million at the time.\n\nSpecifically, the attacker took advantage of the lack of slippage control on liquidity conversions.

However, the Collateral Network (COLT) is gaining recognition due to its promise of high returns. This network is both emerging and innovative. With Collateral Network currently in phase one of its presale, investors are keen to participate in this exciting opportunity.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nLitecoin (LTC): Could It Replace Ethereum?\n\nLitecoin (LTC) has made considerable progress in the crypto world, with recent developments sparking interest among investors. As a faster and more scalable alternative to Bitcoin, Litecoin has long been considered a robust investment. The Litecoin foundation has many benefits. However, they face intense competition from other projects, like the Collateral Network (COLT) which is growing quickly.\n\nDespite its numerous advantages, The Litecoin foundation faces stiff competition from other projects in the market, such as the rapidly growing Collateral Network (COLT). While the Litecoin network has a loyal following, it remains uncertain whether it can genuinely unseat Ethereum as the go-to platform for developers and users or outshine the potential returns of Collateral Network (COLT).\n\nThat being said, Litecoin has been working diligently to stay ahead of the ethereum blockchain and other competition by improving its technology and forging partnerships with prominent players in the industry. These efforts are aimed at bolstering the Litecoin ecosystem and ensuring that it remains an attractive option for investors and users alike and grows market capitalization.\n\nEthereum’s (ETH) Latest Developments Could Solidify its Position\n\nEthereum (ETH) remains a dominant force in the cryptocurrency space, even as new challengers like Litecoin and Collateral Network emerge. Its latest developments, including the ongoing transition to Ethereum 2.0, promise increased growth, efficiency, and security, which could potentially solidify its position as the leading platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications.\n\nHowever, Ethereum is not without its challenges. High gas fees and network congestion issues have led some users to seek out alternatives like Litecoin and the promising Collateral Network. In response, the Ethereum network is working tirelessly to address these issues and maintain its largest cryptocurrency market dominance.\n\nFailure to address these issues could lead to a decrease in market share and a loss of popularity. Therefore, it is important for Ethereum to continue innovating and responding to the needs of its users in order to maintain its relevance and keep competitors like Litecoin (LTC) and Collateral Network (COLT) at bay. For those looking to invest in the future of Ethereum, now is the time to purchase COLT tokens before they become too expensive.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nCollateral Network (COLT): a Disruptive Lending Project\n\nCollateral Network (COLT) is an avant-garde decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that aspires to transform the lending industry. With its on-chain approach using smart contracts, the platform enables users to borrow cryptocurrency against their physical assets without intermediaries or cumbersome paperwork. This is the first and only lending protocol currently on the blockchain that is bringing off-chain assets onto the blockchain to utilize them in this manner.\n\nThese assets are then tokenized into tangible NFTs and then fractionalized. Lenders on the platform can then mint portions of the NFTs to provide funding for the borrower’s loan and get paid an agreed interest for doing so. This unique approach to asset-backed lending has generated a lot of excitement in the industry, prompting several crypto investors and blockchain enthusiasts to invest heavily in the platform.\n\nThe native token of Collateral Network is $COLT, and this token has dual tokenomics features. It serves as a governance token that gives holders the right to vote and participate in important decisions and updates regarding the network. Also, it is a utility token that will be used to perform transactions on the platform.\n\nCOLT is currently in stage 1 of its presale, and over 125 million tokens have already been sold. The price of COLT has been projected to increase by 3500% during its presale, reaching a price of $0.35. With these projections, industry experts have said now is the best time to buy into the Collateral Network ecosystem.\n\nFor more information on Collateral Network visit the website, join the presale or join the community for regular updates.\n\nFind out more about the Collateral Network presale here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.collateralnetwork.io/\n\nPresale: https://presale.collateralnetwork.io/register\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/collateralnwk\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Collateralnwk\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates'}]

The Ethereum (ETH) market is showing signs of bullish momentum as the price has gained less than Bitcoin (BTC) by 0.93% and is currently trading at $1,844. The price is expected to potentially break out to $1,880 if it closes near the resistance at $1,860. Additionally, VanEck predicts that ETH could reach $51,000 in less than seven years under certain conditions. However, the market also faces challenges such as the recent hack on the Arbitrum-based Jimbos Protocol, resulting in a loss of $7.5 million in Ether. Despite competition from Litecoin (LTC) and the emerging Collateral Network (COLT), Ethereum remains a dominant force in the cryptocurrency space with ongoing developments like the transition to Ethereum 2.0.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing uncertainty with potential price fluctuations in the near future. The data indicates volatility in transaction costs, fluctuating total transactions and gas used, and a switching MACD signal, all pointing towards an uncertain market trend.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights both short-term volatility factors like memecoins and potential US debt default, as well as positive developments such as the emergence of liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) following the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade. This presents a mixed outlook for the market, with short-term fluctuations expected but long-term potential through LSDs.

In reflection, it is evident that prioritizing long-term strategies based on on-chain data analysis has been effective in navigating the volatile ETH market successfully. While short-term news reports can sometimes lead to mixed signals and potential profit losses, a moderately conservative trading approach that balances risk management with growth opportunities is recommended.

Considering the synthesized reports, the overall market trend for ETH appears to be uncertain in the short term but potentially positive in the long term due to developments like LSDs. Therefore, it is advisable to focus on long-term strategies and prioritize on-chain data analysis for making informed trading decisions.

Based on this analysis, I would take a slightly conservative approach and assign a trading action of 0.3, reflecting moderate confidence in the long-term positive trend for ETH while also acknowledging the short-term uncertainties in the market.
ACTION:
0.3
DAILY RETURN:
0.012820205135291474
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing volatility and unpredictability. The fluctuations in gas prices, total value transferred, and MACD signals indicate a lack of clear direction in the market trend. Additionally, the news analyst report suggests a bullish sentiment among investors due to the decline in Ethereum balances on exchanges and the increase in staking activities following the Shapella upgrade. The exploration of smart contracts for payments by VISA further highlights the growing interest in Ethereum.

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a long-term strategy based on on-chain data analysis is crucial in navigating the current market conditions successfully. By prioritizing risk management and growth opportunities, traders can capitalize on the potential for increased demand and price appreciation in the future. It is important to monitor key trends such as transaction costs, total transactions, and MACD signals, as well as upcoming developments like liquid staking derivatives and network upgrades.

In conclusion, the overall market trend for ETH appears to be positive in the long term, despite short-term fluctuations and uncertainty. Therefore, a moderately conservative trading approach is recommended to manage risk effectively while taking advantage of long-term growth opportunities in the cryptocurrency market.

Based on the synthesized reports and the emphasis on long-term strategies, I would take a trading action with a confidence level of 0.7, indicating a moderately positive outlook on the market trend.

REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain, news, and reflection analyst reports, it is clear that the ETH market is currently experiencing volatility and uncertainty. The on-chain data indicates fluctuations in key metrics such as gas prices, total value transferred, and MACD signals, suggesting potential for both upward and downward movements. The news analyst report highlights mixed outlooks for various cryptocurrencies, with Ethereum facing bearish trends due to record-high liquidations in long positions. However, the reflection analyst report emphasizes the effectiveness of long-term strategies based on on-chain data analysis in navigating the volatile market successfully.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is evident that a moderately conservative trading approach focusing on long-term growth opportunities and risk management is warranted in the current market environment. Short-term news reports may result in mixed signals and potential profit losses, making it crucial to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains.

Therefore, I would recommend taking a cautious approach and focusing on long-term growth opportunities in the ETH market. My trading action would be to buy ETH with a confidence level of 0.5, indicating a neutral stance with a slight inclination towards a positive market trend. This decision reflects a strategic approach to manage risk effectively while capitalizing on potential long-term growth opportunities in the ETH market.

On that day, its owner began with a cautionary transfer of 1 ETH to a new wallet. One minute later, they transferred the remaining 7,999 ETH to the new wallet address.\n\nAt the time of writing, the ETH stash is worth approximately $14.7 million.\n\nThis transaction was first noticed by blockchain analytics service Lookonchain, which informed its 219,000 Twitter followers of the transfer.\n\nAn Ethereum ICO participant who has been dormant for 8 years woke up today.\n\n\n\nHe transferred all 8000 $ETH($14.7M) to a new address.https://t.co/1griKB9Te9 pic.twitter.com/1bvQh3zsqY — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) May 28, 2023\n\nIn the comments section of the post, there was some community speculation around the reason for the transfer. One commenter suggested that the owner had just been released from prison, while another made a humorous remark that they were transferring funds from an old Ledger — a pointed comment about the company’s controversial new Recover upgrade.\n\nAt the time, the 8,000 ETH was purchased at a price of just $0.31 per token, which places the initial investment amount at around $2,500.\n\nAt today’s prices of $1,917, this marks a staggering 590,000% gain for the owner.\n\nThis isn’t the only ICO-era Ether wallet to re-awaken in recent months. On April 24, another wallet that received 2,365 ETH ($4.5 million) made its first transaction in nearly eight years, with the owner transferring 2,360 ETH to a new wallet address.\n\nOn March 5, another ETH wallet transferred 10,226 ETH ($19.6 million) out to new wallet address after remaining dormant for five years.\n\nThe new wallet address is also one with little in the way of any significant transaction history. The only other ETH transaction recorded in the new wallet is a 207 ETH ($380,000) incoming transaction that was made just a few minutes prior to the most recent transfer. Notably, the additional 207 ETH were sent from another wallet that had remained completely inactive since June 12, 2017.\n\nRelated: Arbitrum-based Jimbos Protocol hacked, losing $7.5M in Ether\n\nInterestingly, the new wallet also contains $46 worth of a memecoin called Gensler (GENSLR), and just $0.24 worth of a dragon-inspired token called Dejitaru Tsuka (TSUKA), according to data from Web3 wallet tracker DeBank.\n\nTotal allocation of token holdings in the owner’s new wallet. Source: DeBank\n\nThe Ethereum ICO occurred raised $18 million in two stages between July and September of 2014. The going exchange rate for the pre-sale was 1 Bitcoin for 2,000 ETH. The Ethereum blockchain was not launched until July 30, 2015, meaning that investors had to wait for more than a year to be able to redeem and use their Ether.\n\nDormant wallets with vast sums of crypto can awaken for a variety of reasons. Sometimes dormant wallets reawaken because they’ve been hacked. Other times, it's simply because the owner may have forgotten about it and upon its re-discovery, have decided that it's possibly a good time to sell.\n\nCrypto City: Guide to Osaka, Japan’s second-biggest city"}, {'id': 17, 'time': 'Mon, 29 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: XRP becomes an outlier as outlook turns bullish - FXStreet', 'content': "Share:\n\nBitcoin price shows a classic Power of Three (PO3) setup in play, forecasting a potential decline to $25,296.\n\nEthereum price could attempt a rally to $2,028 if the bullish outlook persists.\n\nRipple price has set up an inverse head-and-shoulders setup, forecasting a 10.76% increase to $0.515.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price has surprised investors with a quick uptick over the weekend, but it is unclear if this is a spurt in buying pressure or a reentry of sidelined buyers. Judging by the price action, the cause of the uptick is unclear and the bearish outlook explained in previous articles is still valid.\n\nAlso read: Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: BTC set to punish greedy bulls\n\nBitcoin price ready to collapse\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price breached its two-week consolidation on May 28 and collected the buy-stop liquidity resting above May 10 swing high at $28,293. This liquidity run was soon followed by a retracement, which is underway and signals a Power of Three (PO3) setup in play.\n\nThis technical formation has three phases – accumulation, manipulation and distribution. As the name indicates, the asset usually moves sideways in the first phase and is often followed by a sweep of a critical level, which is termed manipulation.\n\nThe third or the last phase is distribution, which leads to volatile rallies in the opposite direction of manipulation. In Bitcoin’s case, BTC swept a local top at $28,293 and is trading at $27,879, signaling the next move should favor bears.\n\nIf this setup plays out, Bitcoin price could reach the $25,764 support level to collect the sell-stop liquidity. Should the selling pressure persist even after this 7.6% decline, BTC price could hit the next critical support level at $25,296.\n\nThese levels are key accumulation levels, as seen in previous articles.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin Weekly Forecast: BTC delays inevitable crash to $25,000\n\nBTC/USD 4-hour chart\n\nOn the other hand, if Bitcoin price continues to tread above the $28,051 level, it could attempt an extension of this weekend's rally.

If this level fails to hold, ETH will invalidate the bullish thesis and could trigger a correction to $1,703.\n\nRipple price flips bullish amid confusing times\n\nRipple price has set up an inverse head-and-shoulders set up on the four-hour chart. This technical formation contains three swing lows, with the central one lower than the other two. The ones on each side are defined as the shoulders, while the central one is the head. Connecting the peaks using a trend line reveals a declining resistance level known as the neckline.\n\nThis setup forecasts a 10.76% upswing to $0.515, determined by measuring the distance between the right shoulder’s peak and the head’s lowest point, adding it to the breakout point at $0.465 (see chart below).\n\nSo far, Ripple price has not only breached the neckline but has also rallied nearly 4%, currently trading at $0.481. If the bullish trend continues, XRP price could rally another 7.30% before it hits the theoretical target.\n\nXRP/USD 4-hour chart\n\nInvalidation of the inverse head-and-shoulders setup will occur if Ripple price slices the neckline at $0.465. If this bearish outlook continues, XRP price could slide towards the May 24 low at $0.442."}, {'id': 5, 'time': 'Mon, 29 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Does This New Ethereum Rival Really Have 400x Upside Potential? - The Motley Fool', 'content': "Ethereum (ETH 0.03%) remains one of the great all-time crypto investments. If you had invested in Ethereum way back in 2015 when things were just getting started, you'd be up a head-spinning 63,500% today.\n\nSo it's perhaps no surprise that the arrival of what some are calling the next Ethereum is cause for celebration in the crypto world. We've seen that already with the likes of Solana and Avalanche -- both were tagged as potential Ethereum killers almost as soon as they launched. And we are starting to see the same phenomenon with Sui (CRYPTO: SUI), a highly touted Layer-1 blockchain that just launched in May.\n\nWhat is Sui?\n\nSui is a super-fast, super-scalable proof-of-stake Layer-1 blockchain with a nearly impeccable pedigree. Many of the developers at Sui worked on Diem, the big blockchain project from Meta Platforms. And the founders of Sui have already lined up more than $330 million in venture capital from some high-profile names, including Coinbase Ventures.\n\nThe big draw right now seems to be Sui's transaction processing speed. The blockchain claims to be able to process up to 300,000 transactions per second (TPS), which is way beyond what even Solana (65,000 TPS) can offer. Moreover, the developer team behind Sui claims the blockchain is optimized for digital assets and the brave new world of Web3, due in large part to the programming language they use.\n\nHow high can Sui go?\n\nA little market cap comparison will give you a good idea of how high Sui could soar. Right now, it has a market cap of slightly over $500 million. So if it does a 10 times return on investment, it would give Sui a market cap of approximately $5 billion -- that's Solana and Avalanche territory. Currently, Solana has a market cap of $7.7 billion, and Avalanche's is $4.7 billion.\n\nBut let's say Sui eventually replaces Ethereum simply based on its superior performance characteristics. That's when things will really get interesting. Ethereum has a market cap of more than $200 billion right now, so if Sui ever catches up to Ethereum, that would be a 400-fold return on investment. You can start to see why investors love the concept of the next Ethereum -- the numbers get very big quickly.\n\nIn many ways, this same logic has already played out with Aptos (APT -1.04%), which was introduced in October 2022. Aptos was the other major blockchain project spun out of Diem, and like Sui, it came with an impeccable pedigree, top developer talent, and high-profile venture capital backing. Despite practically launching into the eye of a tornado (the FTX debacle in November 2022), Aptos is now up a staggering 125% year to date and is already one of the top 40 cryptos in the world by market capitalization.\n\nBut do we really need another Ethereum?\n\nThe big question, of course, is whether the blockchain world needs another Ethereum. At one time, we did, because Ethereum was still a slow, old-fashioned proof-of-work blockchain. But then came The Merge last year, and as a result, I'm not convinced we really need another Ethereum. Many speed and performance issues have now been addressed, and Ethereum pulled off The Merge without a hitch.\n\nSo for Sui to hit all its grandiose growth targets, many things would have to go right. For one, developers would have to perceive a real need to abandon Ethereum and switch to another blockchain for all their future development projects. I don't think that's going to happen. Moreover, Sui would have to beat out not just Ethereum but also a long list of previous Ethereum-killers, including (but not limited to) Solana, Avalanche, and now Aptos. That's a big ask.\n\nIt's still Ethereum, and it's not even close\n\nFor now, I cannot recommend Sui as a long-term investment. It's certainly interesting because of its price (still trading for around $1) and pedigree. But I just don't think faster speeds are enough to win over developers, users, and investors.\n\nAt the end of the day, people want to see what's built on top of the platform, and right now, you just can't beat Ethereum, which is dominant in many key areas of the blockchain world. Ethereum is still the world's premier Layer-1 blockchain. As a result, I remain bullish on Ethereum, both short-term and long-term."}, {'id': 8, 'time': 'Mon, 29 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Ethereum nears Visa in processed transaction volume, what this means - FXStreet', 'content': "Share:\n\nEthereum almost caught up with Visa in processed transaction volume, recording $3.01 trillion vs. $3.08 trillion respectively.\n\nThe popular blockchain is already the network of choice for many established players looking to utilize the novel technology, Visa included.\n\nNotably, Ethereum is far younger than the traditional payments giant.\n\nThe report attests to growth in mainstream adoption of crypto and blockchain, despite association with scammers, drug dealers, and cybercriminals.\n\nEthereum (ETH), though younger than traditional payment moguls like Visa, has shown that blockchain has become a formidable force in the financial market for the second time in three years. The news comes after a Coingraph report indicating that the Ethereum blockchain recorded a trading volume of $3.01 trillion against Visa's $3.08 trillion.\n\nJUST IN: $ETH almost caught up with Visa in processed transaction volume - $3.01 trillion vs. $3.08 trillion, respectively. — Coingraph | News (@CoingraphNews) May 29, 2023\n\nEthereum premiered in 2016, 58 years after Bank of America (BofA) founded Visa as the BankAmericard credit card program.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum ZK rollups eye Arbitrum's market share as adoption rises\n\nEthereum almost caught up with Visa in processed transaction volume\n\nEthereum (ETH) blockchain has recorded a massive $3.01 trillion trading volume, only about 0.07 trillion less than Visa. The competition is remarkable, especially for Ethereum, because of the bearish market since mid-2022.\n\nWith this information, Ethereum testifies to the growth in blockchain technology so much that it can now rival established players within the payments technology space. It also evidences the growth in mainstream adoption of a budding technology often associated with an enabler of crime. This is because scammers, drug dealers, and cyber criminals are now more inclined to digital assets than traditional finance.\n\nBased on Etherscan data, Ethereum daily transactions hit 968,996 on May 28, with the all-time high being 1,932,711 transactions on December 9, 2022.\n\nAlso Read: Ethereum worth $7.5M stolen in Arbitrum-based Jimbos Protocol exploit\n\nAs the second-largest blockchain in the world, Ethereum powers a wide range of financial technology solutions committed to revolutionizing the finance market on a global scale. These solutions include staking, lending, flash loans, and decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nFurther, the Ethereum blockchain has become a wealthy, agile, and dynamic environment with a wide provision for further development. This is another advantage of Ethereum over traditional financial layers.\n\nEthereum foray into TradeFi\n\nThe famous blockchain is already the choice network for most established traders and investors like Visa, who want to use the novel technology. A May report about Ethereum's economics indicated that Visa employed Ethereum's Goerli testnet to try transaction-free payments using account abstraction.\n\nIt leveraged a smart contract christened 'Paymaster,' which allowed the company to capitalize on account abstraction to perform complex tasks on behalf of accounts and manage transaction costs. Citing Head of Crypto Cuy Sheffield at Visa at the time:\n\nExcited to see Visa deploy our first paymaster smart contract on testnet as we continue to research and experiment with account abstraction and ERC-4337.\n\nERC-4337 is an Ethereum standard that performs account abstraction without a consensus-layer alteration. This allows users to bundle and automate transactions on the network.\n\nEthereum previous triumph over visa: A deep dive into the factors\n\nThis is not the first time Ethereum has shown its gusto against Visa. The blockchain network had outperformed the payments giant in 2021, recording $11.6 trillion against Visa's $10.4 trillion trading volume.\n\nIn 2021, VISA moved $10.4 trillion in payments volume, Ethereum moved $11.6 trillion. — Blockworks (@Blockworks_) January 19, 2022\n\nThis was attributed to the second largest crypto recording 4.5X as many daily transactions as Visa and was corroborated by Ethereum Foundation's Josh Stark.\n\nFUN FACT: #Ethereum processed 4.5x times more transactions than Visa in 2021. — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) May 6, 2022\n\nDespite the difficult conditions in the crypto market, Ethereum survived through regulatory clampdowns, a myriad of bank crises amidst turbulences in traditional finance, and the ensuing Fear, of Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD). The role of developments and upgrades cannot be ignored as these are the major reasons for ETH high volume transactions. The Merge upgrade and Shanghai/Capella (Shapella) upgrade are among the major upgrades, as they reduced the gas fees and spiked the number of transactions between 2022 and 2023."}, {'id': 15, 'time': 'Mon, 29 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Ethereum's Shanghai upgrade made it easier to detect criminals - Cointelegraph", 'content': 'With its historic Merge event in September, Ethereum has become a proof-of-stake blockchain. The mechanism now used to confirm transactions relies on validators staking their Ether (ETH). Ethereum’s March upgrade, codenamed Shanghai, finally enabled stakers to withdraw their locked Ether.\n\nThe Ethereum ecosystem’s “investment themes” have included a) decentralized finance (DeFi) b) stablecoins c) Bitcoin (via wrapped versions of BTC) and d) non-fungible tokens (NFTs). With the upgrade, the network also began providing fixed-income assets.\n\nThere are currently several ways people make money on or using Ethereum. Broadly, they can be grouped into “investment themes,” including: a) decentralized finance (DeFi); b) stablecoins; c) Bitcoin (BTC) (via wrapped versions of BTC); and d) nonfungible tokens (NFTs). Following Shanghai, the network began to offer fixed-income assets.\n\nRisk-free rate\n\nYield is one of the core pillars of traditional finance (TradFi). A rise or fall in yield leads to an increase or decrease in the perceived risk of other financial assets. Thus, movements in the benchmark rate set by the United States Federal Reserve provide the rationale behind investment decisions, in general.\n\nRelated: Ethereum is going to transform investing\n\nAccordingly, compliance professionals use trends in the risk-free rate to detect irrational movement of funds in capital markets, as such fund flows might be attempts to launder money. The reasoning here is that launderers of illicit funds do not actively chase financial gains like regular investors, as the sole purpose of money laundering is to obfuscate the trail of dirty money.\n\nWith Ethereum’s staking yield denoting the “risk-free rate” of the crypto ecosystem, the Shanghai upgrade may have enhanced the state of crypto forensics.\n\nTradFi forensics focuses on activity — crypto forensics focuses on entities\n\nFinancial crime risk in TradFi is managed using automatic systems that alert institutions to probable illicit use of financial assets. While data scientists design and deploy models to raise red flags over suspicious transactions, investigation teams still must assess resultant leads and evaluate if Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) need to be filed.\n\nAn interesting point of contrast between forensics for TradFi and crypto is that the latter focuses more on the criminal entity than the activity itself. In other words, investigators analyze networks of crypto wallets to identify transfers of criminal assets.\n\nMoney laundering occurs in three stages: a) Placement: proceeds of crime enter the financial system; b) Layering: complex movement of funds to obscure the audit trail and sever the link with the original crime; and c) Integration: criminal proceeds are now fully absorbed into the legal economy and can be used for any purpose.\n\nFor crypto assets, it is convenient to design solutions to detect the placement of illicit assets. This is because most laundered money originates from crypto-native crimes such as ransomware attacks, DeFi bridge hacks, smart contract exploits and phishing schemes. In all such offenses, a perpetrator’s wallet addresses are readily available. Consequently, once a crime has been committed, relevant wallets are monitored to analyze asset flows.\n\nIn contrast, forensic experts working for, say, a bank do not have any visibility into the offense — such as human or drug trafficking, cybercrime or terrorism — when criminal proceeds are being injected into a bank’s ecosystem. This makes detection extremely difficult. Hence, most Anti-Money Laundering (AML) solutions are designed to identify layering.\n\nEthereum’s staking rewards make it easier to detect unusual activity\n\nTo design solutions to detect layering, it is imperative to think like criminals, who craft complex flows of funds to obfuscate the money trail. The time-tested approach to exposing such activity is to spot the irrational movement of assets. This is because money laundering does not have the goal of generating profit.\n\nWith Ether’s post-Shanghai staking yields providing benchmark interest rates for crypto, we can formulate baseline risk-reward structures. Armed with this, investigators can systematically spot financial behavior running counter-intuitive to trends in the benchmark rate.\n\nRelated: Thanks to Ethereum, ‘altcoin’ is no longer a slur\n\nTo illustrate, there might be a pattern where an address or a group of addresses that points toward an entity that consistently takes on high risk while earning below the risk-free rate. A situation like that would almost certainly be investigated at a bank.\n\nCase in point, such a transaction surveillance architecture can be used to detect the wash trading of NFTs. Here, multiple market participants collude to carry out numerous NFT trades with the goal of layering criminal assets or manipulating prices. Since earning profits is not the intention behind the vast bulk of these transactions, such activity will raise a red flag.\n\nSimila...'}]

[{'id': 1, 'time': 'Tue, 30 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': '100000 Addresses Are Helping Ethereum Scale — You Can Too - Blockworks', 'content': 'To scale Ethereum, researchers came up with a plan to make storing data from layer-2 rollups much cheaper. The first phase entails the introduction of EIP-4844 — known as proto-danksharding — to Ethereum mainnet, anticipated to happen with the Dencun upgrade by year’s end.\n\nBut to do that, they needed some entropy — random data, or “secrets” if you will — and preferably lots of it.\n\nEIP-4844 will introduce a new “blob-carrying transaction” — a temporary data storage mechanism for layer-2’s to pass data to Ethereum mainnet validators.\n\nBlockspace on Ethereum is at a premium, so to cut down on the requirements for verifying layer-2 data, Ethereum will use a polynomial commitment scheme known as KZG commitments, which is necessary for data availability sampling under proto-danksharding.\n\nKZG commitments, in turn, require a “trusted setup” — a way to generate a common set of parameters that provers and verifiers use to function. For the setup to be trusted, there needs to be a set of random values used as inputs that nobody knows. When done improperly, it can compromise the proof system, as famously happened to Zcash in 2018.\n\nWithout getting too deep into the technical nuances of Merkle Trees and Kate proofs (the “K” in “KZG”), it’s important to know just one thing:\n\nYou only need one honest participant to guarantee the validity of the trusted setup for everyone.\n\nEthereum researchers devised a way to let anyone with an Ethereum address participate, with some history of using the network required to join in. It’s a goodwill gesture — you get nothing in return except for peace of mind.\n\nAs a participant, you only need to trust yourself and no one else, because each contribution contributes to the randomness of the system — effectively guaranteeing that there can be no collusion in the trusted setup. It’s easy and takes just a minute of work and some waiting at ceremony.ethereum.org.\n\nWhen opened to the public on April 17, contributions were limited to Ethereum users with a lot of transaction history to cut down on the wait time. But those limits were gradually reduced such that today you can contribute with only 16 transactions.\n\nThat lowered bar is one reason why the number of total contributions has been on the up and up, recently passing 100,000 unique contributions.\n\nThat doesn’t necessarily mean 100,000 individuals — one person can have more than one address — but only one contribution per address is allowed, and each one contributes a small measure of security to the rollup-centered future of Ethereum.\n\nDon’t miss the next big story – join our free daily newsletter.'}, {'id': 24, 'time': 'Tue, 30 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "If You Invested Your 3 Stimulus Checks In Bitcoin, Dogecoin And Ethereum, Here's How Much You'd Have Now - Benzinga", 'content': "The COVID-19 pandemic hit businesses and consumers with items like business closings, job cuts and layoffs. The aftershocks continue today, with higher inflation and a tight job market coming on the back end of the pandemic.\n\nThe U.S. government gave out several stimulus payments during the height of COVID to help individuals and families deal with rising costs and job losses.\n\nThose who received the stimulus checks were free to do with the money as they wished, including potentially investing it if they did not need the money for bills or savings.\n\nWhat Happened: In 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Act (CARES Act) was signed into law. Under the law, Americans received three rounds of stimulus payments. While some used the money for bills and to boost their savings, others chose to invest in stocks and cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe CARES Act paid out $1,200 to eligible adults and $500 more for those with qualifying children for its first stimulus payment.\n\nThe subsequent Tax Relief Act of 2020 paid out an additional $600 per eligible adult and up to $600 more for those with qualifying children in December 2020. The American Rescue Act of 2021 provided an additional $1,400 payment to eligible adults and up to $1,400 for those with qualifying children.\n\nHere's a look at the return a consumer would have if they put their stimulus checks ($1,200, $600 and $1,400) into leading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin BTC/USD, Dogecoin DOGE/USD and Ethereum ETH/USD.\n\nThe hypothetical results are based on the dates of April 11, 2020; December 29, 2020; and March 12, 2021 for the stimulus checks.\n\nRelated Link: 2021 Was The Year Of Dogecoin: A Month By Month Retrospective With Top Stories\n\nStimulus Checks in Bitcoin: Investing in Bitcoin with a portion of the stimulus checks may have been a popular option for investors and people looking to store some of the payment away from the U.S. government.\n\nBitcoin traded at $6,926 on April 11, 2020, $27,370 on December 29, 2020 and $57,996 on March 12, 2021. A person who put all $3,200 from the stimulus checks into Bitcoin would have been able to purchase a total of 0.219 BTC.\n\nBased on a price of $27,719.72 for Bitcoin today, that $3,200 would now be worth $6,070.62.\n\nStimulus Checks in Dogecoin: The meme cryptocurrency known as Dogecoin gained interest and value in 2021 thanks to retail investors and vocal public supporters like Mark Cuban and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Here’s how stimulus checks in Dogecoin would have fared.\n\nDogecoin traded at $0.0020 on April 11, 2020, $0.0046 on December 29, 2020 and $0.0570 on March 12, 2021. A person who put all $3,200 from the stimulus checks into Dogecoin would have been able to purchase 754,996 DOGE. Based on a price of $0.07243 today, that $3,200 would now be worth $56,043.35.\n\nStimulus Checks In Ethereum: One of the fastest-growing cryptocurrencies in 2021 was Ethereum, thanks to its connection to non-fungible tokens. Here’s a look at how stimulus checks invested in the second largest cryptocurrency would have fared.\n\nEthereum traded at $161.17 on April 11, 2020, $737.95 on December 29, 2020 and $1,839.50 on March 12, 2021. A person who put the $3,200 into Ethereum would have been able to purchase 9.02 ETH. Based on a price of $1,905.18 for Ethereum today, that $3,200 investment would now be worth $17,184.72 today.\n\nStimulus Check In All 3 Cryptocurrencies: A more diversified approach from an investor could have seen investments in Bitcoin, Dogecoin and Ethereum. Splitting the $3,200 into equal investments of the three cryptocurrencies on the respective stimulus payout days would have given an investor 0.0731 BTC, 251,665 DOGE and 3 ETH. The three cryptocurrencies would be worth $25,969.95 today based on equal investments from the three stimulus checks.\n\nRead Next: How To Buy Cryptocurrencies\n\nPhoto: Wikimedia Commons, freepngimg.com."}, {'id': 6, 'time': 'Tue, 30 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'The Flippenings: Bear to Bull Market and Ethereum NFTs to Bitcoin Ordinals - Yahoo Finance', 'content': 'Change is in the air. Crypto and non-fungible tokens (NFT) have been in a pretty brutal bear market for almost exactly a year now, which many, myself included, had projected to last for years.\n\nBut now, there are signs of life springing up all around, being driven by Bitcoin NFTs, and recent news of China opening the door for citizens to engage the blockchain again. The bear market may be over sooner than we had thought, so let’s get into what’s making me think that NFTs might just be back.\n\nNoteworthy Happenings\n\nChina is coming into NFTs and crypto, and Russia will use crypto to settle payments across borders. These two major announcements are bringing excitement back to the NFT and crypto markets and lead many to believe that these alone can turn the market around.\n\nCollectors are eying high-priced NFTs ahead of a potential incoming pump from Chinese investors looking to snatch NFT grails like CryptoPunks, BAYC and Azuki. An x-factor that not enough people are talking about yet is, what if they decided to dive into the mostly unexplored world of Bitcoin NFTs where opportunities may be even greater than the already expensive Ethereum ecosystem?\n\n9c5633eec1494d4082106924f68b42e7\n\n6cb7e0d5822d4f94890b7c0403522c78\n\nBitcoin NFTs are really starting to cook, and just yesterday the 10 millionth Ordinal was inscribed . This massive milestone many thought improbable just a few months ago, but believers in Bitcoin NFTs never had a doubt. At this point, no one can deny that Bitcoin’s NFTs are here to stay, but the question of ‘Will Bitcoin NFTs flip Ethereum NFTs?’ is another story. I think they will.\n\nA new token standard was created on Bitcoin yesterday called BRC-721E . This will let traders bridge their Ethereum NFT over to Bitcoin by “burning” the Ethereum NFT and re-creating it on Bitcoin. Now we’ll get to see traders’ convictions on the Bitcoin ecosystem play out in real time.\n\nA new meta is emerging in NFTs which is to drop a new cryptocurrency (an ERC-20 or BRC-20 token) and then build an ecosystem around it, likely with NFTs. $OXBT is the new hottest BRC-20 collection on Bitcoin, and there are teases of upcoming utility for this token. Fun fact , $OXBT is now held by more wallets than any other individual digital asset on the Bitcoin blockchain other than BTC itself and its smaller denomination, Satoshis.\n\nStory continues\n\na4599e0a4dd145aeb61cc2d24f2dd35b\n\nThis hot new meta recently took off with new meme coins like $PEPE, $TURBO, $BEN, and $PSYOP looking for ways to drive more users to the token, and the concept now seems destined to shape the NFT scene for the foreseeable future.\n\nGaming on the cusp of taking over Web3\n\nGaming is on the cusp of taking over Web3. Epic Games, the creator of Fortnite, now has over 20 blockchain games listed on their store with some like Defimons now entering a closed beta.\n\nIf Mythos Chain’s DMarket, and ImmutableX’s Gods Unchained are any indication of what’s to come (they are), we’re in for a meteoric rise in NFT adoption. Just look at how the buyers/sellers and transactions compare to a typical PFP project.\n\n\n\n2a9870b110894ef6afe55c2126bd4afc\n\nSales from these two projects have propelled them into the top five for the past seven days, foreshadowing what’s to come as blockchain games begin to enter the mainstream.\n\nd8d1482d3ccc4c458ecb33ecf14db76e\n\nPeep the charts\n\nI don’t know about you, but I’m fascinated to see who Bitcoin’s growth impacts more, Ethereum and its layer 2s, or Solana? Take notice of which chains aren’t in the top 10 NFT Collection Rankings by Sales Volume for the past 7 days, and you’ll see who it may be.\n\nNakamigos have had a sudden surge, as have Jack Butchers’ art project Openens, pushing both ahead of Milady Maker and into the Top 10. Milady Maker continues to hang around with the big dogs, now with extra action that revolves around the new BRC-721E bridge that originated in the Milady project.\n\n\n\n\n\n5c6fad5d8fee4767872aa5e437fb3e7f\n\nBitcoin continues to fall from its previous seven-day highs, but other ecosystems like Solana and Ethereum are on the upswing. I expect this tug-of-war to continue until new users come into the space, and bring liquidity to be able to push both up at the same time.\n\n(Disclosure: The author of this commentary holds $OXBT)'}]

As these use cases continue to grow in popularity, it could lead to increased demand for Ethereum and a higher price.”\n\nGoogle Bard was sure to qualify that although possible, the ETH flippening may not happen:\n\n“Overall, it is possible that Ethereum could flip Bitcoin in the next 5 years.

The recent movement of over $650 million in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, and XRP by crypto whales indicates significant activity in the market, potentially influencing price movements. Ethereum's price analysis suggests a breakout towards the $2K resistance level, with bullish sentiment prevailing. Additionally, the prediction that Ethereum could potentially surpass Bitcoin in market cap within the next five years adds to the positive outlook for Ethereum. However, the shift in focus from Ethereum to Dogecoin by a crypto miner post the Merge raises questions about asset management strategies.

In reflecting on the reports, it is important to consider the effectiveness of long-term strategies based on on-chain data analysis in navigating the volatile market successfully. While short-term news reports may provide mixed signals, prioritizing risk management and growth opportunities has led to positive outcomes. Therefore, it is crucial to continue prioritizing on-chain data analysis, risk management, and key trends to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities while managing risk effectively.

Considering the conflicting perspectives and the importance of long-term strategies, I would take a moderately conservative approach in this scenario. Given the potential for growth and ongoing innovation in the Ethereum market, I would lean towards a slightly bullish outlook. Therefore, my trading action would be to buy ETH with a confidence level of 0.3, indicating a cautious but optimistic stance on the market trend.
ACTION:

DAILY RETURN:
0.003888676957126025
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the market trend for ETH is currently bearish, with a potential for further decline in price. The decrease in open price, increasing gas prices, and the sell trend indicated by the MACD signal all point towards a negative outlook for ETH in the short term.

On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights positive developments for Ethereum, such as advancements in scaling, community support, and potential market shifts towards a bullish trend. These factors suggest a more positive outlook for ETH in the long term.

Considering the reflection analyst report, which emphasizes the effectiveness of long-term strategies based on on-chain data analysis and risk management, it is clear that a moderately conservative trading approach is warranted. Balancing cautious optimism with a strategic mindset is crucial to capitalize on potential growth opportunities while managing risk effectively.

In conclusion, while short-term indicators may point towards a bearish trend, the positive long-term developments and the effectiveness of long-term strategies suggest a more optimistic outlook for ETH. Therefore, I would take a slightly bullish stance and buy ETH with a confidence level of 0.3 to reflect my strategic decision to manage risk appropriately and capitalize on potential long-term growth opportunities.

DAILY RETURN:
-0.013878150131861444
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently bearish, with a downward trend in prices and a sell signal indicated by the MACD. The high gas prices and fluctuating total value transferred further support the notion of a continued downward trend. 

On the other hand, the news analyst report suggests that there is potential for a rally in Ethereum if key resistance levels are broken, leading to a price increase towards $2,000 and beyond. However, the overall market conditions, including sell-offs and concerns over a U.S. debt default, are contributing to volatility.

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a combination of on-chain data analysis and risk management strategies have been effective in guiding trading decisions. Long-term trends and growth opportunities based on on-chain data analysis have been more successful compared to short-term fluctuations influenced by news reports.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is advisable to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains in the ETH market. While there may be potential for a rally if key resistance levels are broken, the overall bearish trend indicated by on-chain data suggests a cautious approach is warranted.

Therefore, my trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.7, reflecting a moderate level of confidence in the bearish market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.

The recent movement of over $650 million in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, and XRP by crypto whales indicates significant activity in the market, potentially influencing price movements. Ethereum's price analysis suggests a breakout towards the $2K resistance level, with bullish sentiment prevailing. Additionally, the prediction that Ethereum could potentially surpass Bitcoin in market cap within the next five years adds to the positive outlook for Ethereum. However, the shift in focus from Ethereum to Dogecoin by a crypto miner post the Merge raises questions about asset management strategies. Overall, the market trend for Ethereum appears optimistic, with potential for growth towards the predicted price targets by the end of 2023.

To some extent, when measuring for risk-adjusted returns over the long-term, that argument holds water, as there are several high potential cryptos better than Bitcoin worth considering.\n\nHowever, not all investors are looking at crypto with the same investing time horizon or frame of reference. Over the near-term, a number of other top tokens have performed very well, and may outperform these top two cryptos over time.\n\nAmidst the backdrop of a domestic banking crisis and looming concerns over a U.S. debt default, investors are increasingly considering cryptocurrencies as potential safe haven assets to navigate the economic challenges ahead. This shift in thinking marks a significant departure from just six months ago when the prevailing belief was that the “crypto winter” would persist well into 2023.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut, the question arises: Are there any genuinely secure cryptocurrencies to invest in at present? If so, which ones should investors consider adding to their portfolios this month? Here are three cryptos on the top of my list of projects that could potentially outperform Bitcoin and Ethereum over the next 2-3 years.\n\nSymbol Cryptocurrency Price XMR-USD Monero $145.68 AVAX-USD Avalanche $14.44 SOL-USD Solana $20.50\n\nMonero (XMR-USD)\n\nA concept coin for Monero (XMR) has a sparkly gold background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIntroduced in 2014, Monero (XMR-USD) is a decentralized cryptocurrency and blockchain network that prioritizes privacy. With its advanced features like stealth addresses and ring signatures, Monero ensures user anonymity. Nonetheless, this commitment to privacy has also attracted heightened regulatory attention globally. This makes it one of those high potential cryptos better than Bitcoin.\n\nMonero is a leading privacy coin, offering complete anonymity and untraceability for its blockchain transactions. By employing advanced technology, Monero conceals the sender, recipient, and transaction amount, providing a high level of privacy. Encapsulating its ethos, with its motto “secure, private, untraceable,” Monero has garnered global user appeal. The rising demand for privacy coins has propelled XMR’s price up by 16% over the past six months.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother key point is that despite regulatory and legislative scrutiny due to its potential involvement in illicit activities like international money laundering, Monero remains popular among users who are undeterred by such criticisms. The usage and value of XMR have consistently increased, with a remarkable 76% rise since 2017. Crypto enthusiasts believe that the ongoing regulation of cryptocurrencies will further drive users toward the privacy provided by Monero, indicating promising prospects for continued growth.\n\nMonero relies on Proof-of-Work for decentralized consensus and offers private, secure, and untraceable transactions through an opaque blockchain. With a default privacy setting, Monero utilizes ring confidential transactions, ring signatures, and stealth addresses. As a fungible and secure digital currency, Monero prioritizes user privacy, leading to a promising future ahead.\n\nAvalanche (AVAX-USD)\n\nGraphic of various cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum resting on a United Kingdom Union Jack flag\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/rawf8\n\nAvalanche (AVAX-USD) started May 2023 on a bullish note, trading at $16.66. Despite the bears maintaining a price of $14 since May 18, Avalanche is now edging toward the $15 mark, aiming to regain its positive price trend. The surge in trading volume indicates increased activity on the network.\n\nRecently, Avalanche has established significant support at the $14.29 price level, acting as a pivotal point for the asset. Currently, it is trading above this immediate resistance level. However, the presence of bearish market forces persists, aiming to prevent AVAX from surpassing the next resistance level at $15.21. Despite its bearish nature in the short-term, it’s still one of those high potential cryptos better than Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the integration of the Ethereum Virtual Machine sets Avalanche apart as a favored platform. Developers can now create decentralized applications on a broader scale while leveraging the advantages of a faster and more economical blockchain. The Avalanche Bridge further enhances convenience and accessibility by facilitating seamless asset transfers across multiple blockchains.\n\nThe bottom line is that Avalanche stands out as a superior choice in terms of security compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Its unique feature of subnets allows the creation of both private and public blockchains, adding versatility to its network. With practical applications in the real world, Avalanche exhibits immense potential for value and growth. Despite facing a significant downturn in the 2022 bear market, Avalanche h...'}]

Validators secure the network now, and the path to becoming one is supposed to be tremendously simplified – deposit 32 ETH to the staking contract and run the appropriate software.\n\nBut it turns out that there’s quite a queue for validators lined up, and becoming one might take some time.\n\n45 Days to Become an Ethereum Validator\n\nYou read that right – if you have ETH to spare and you want to invest in securing the network and earn rewards for this important task, you’d have to wait… a lot.\n\nIt appears that becoming a validator is something so sought after that the queue keeps on increasing.\n\nData from WenMerge shows that there are 92,536 validators currently waiting to enter the network. This will take approximately 45 days to clean up.\n\nThe competition is so high, and it appears that practically nobody wants to exit. The exit queue currently consists of only 4 validators.\n\nCelsius Enters the Queue\n\nThe embattled cryptocurrency lender is part of the reason why the queue is stretched out.\n\nThroughout the past couple of days, Celsius Network has moved some $600 million worth of ETH into the staking contract and this rate shows no signs of slowing down, according to Arkham Intelligence.\n\nCelsius is making moves to stake all the ETH they currently hold, representing movements totalling almost $1B in on-chain flows. Over the past 24 hours, they have staked over $600M of ETH, with their rate of deposits showing no sign of slowing. 👇 pic.twitter.com/8bW3xB15UH — Arkham (@ArkhamIntel) June 2, 2023\n\nAt current prices, the above is made up of around 316K ETH added to the validator enter queue.\n\nRecall that back in April, CryptoPotato reported that leading US-based cryptocurrency exchanges – Coinbase and Gemini – joined the bid for the lender’s assets.'}, {'id': 9, 'time': 'Sat, 03 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Celsius’ $800M ETH Staking Extends Ethereum Queue - CoinGape', 'content': 'Bankrupt crypto lender Celsius Network has made an $800 million ether (ETH) staking move that has caused significant delays in the Ethereum validator queue.

Although he cannot call himself a "fan" of technical analysis, he is sure that two trends are obvious: Bitcoin\'s (BTC) domination shrinks while the Ethereum (ETH) one grows.\n\nNot a fan of technical analysis but it\'s hard to argue against long-term trends.\n\n\n\nIf the trend continues, $ETH will flip $BTC within the next 2-3 years. pic.twitter.com/CSFtnjwgnF — Mo (@MorganTBennett) June 2, 2023\n\nShould both trend lines be valid, the "flippening" might happen in the next two or three years. On the chart by Bennett, it takes place in Q4, 2026. Thanks to the growing size of the altcoin market, both cryptocurrencies will be responsible for 23-24% by the moment of "flippening."\n\nEthereum (ETH) can surpass Bitcoin (BTC) "gently," "gradually," "suddenly" or both cryptocurrencies can fall victim to the "Digital Gold" narrative disappearing.\n\nBy press time, Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency, is in charge of over 46.2% of cryptocurrency market capitalization, while Ethereum\'s (ETH) share exceeds 19.5%. The third largest cryptocurrency, the U.S. Dollar Tether (USDT) stablecoin, totals 7.36% of net crypto market cap.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), two largest cryptocurrencies, were at the closest point to "flippening" six years ago, in mid-June 2017. Bitcoin (BTC) was in charge of 37% of the market, and Ethereum\'s (ETH) capitalization comprised 32%.\n\nBy contrast, in September 2019, Bitcoin\'s (BTC) market cap was 10x larger than that of Ethereum (ETH) since the latter was much more affected by the Crypto Winter of 2018-2020.\n\n"Flippening could happen, but line is ridiculous," crypto veteran Chris Blec says\n\nThe followers of Bennett agreed with his calculations. However, some of them stressed that they are tired of "flippening" narratives that have been discussed here and there since the launch of Ethereum (ETH) in June 2015.\n\nProminent DeFi analyst and influencer Chris Blec, author of the Blec Report project, says that in general, Bitcoin (BTC) has all chances of being surpassed by Ethereum (ETH), but the accuracy of the aforementioned model should not be overestimated:\n\nI don\'t disagree that the flippening could happen but that line is really ridiculous.. you just completely ignored all of the data points between 2016 and today\n\nBennett agreed with this point of view, but added that it is impossible to find a function that does not predict the flippening even if Ethereum\'s (ETH) dominance at the start was considered 0.'}, {'id': 3, 'time': 'Sat, 03 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Rapid growth in DeFi-focused Ethereum liquid staking derivatives platforms raises eyebrows - Cointelegraph', 'content': 'Ether’s (ETH) decentralized finance (DeFi) activity has declined in the bear market, and the sector faces further competition from Ethereum’s annual staking reward of 4%, according to Glassnode analysts. However, a DeFi narrative is building around liquid staking derivative (LSD) tokens, which could revive Ethereum’s network activity.\n\nThe percentage of gas consumed by DeFi protocols has dropped from 34% in 2020 to between 8% and 16% presently, with nonfungible tokens (NFTs) commanding the maximum share of 25–30%, according to a recent report from Glassnode.\n\nEthereum gas usage by transaction type.

Moreover, DeFi protocols also come with smart contract risk, which is eliminated with proof-of-stake validators.\n\nStaking has become popular among Ethereum investors, especially after the Shapella upgrade in April 2023, which enabled redemptions from the staking contract.\n\nBy the end of May, Ethereum users staked 21.63 million ETH worth $40.021 billion, representing 18% of Ethereum’s total supply.\n\nLSD platforms like Lido and Rocket Pool account for one-third of this massive market. These applications offer a tokenized representation of staked ETH, allowing investors access to the staking yields without compromising liquidity.\n\nA growing trend among Ethereum investors is interacting with LSD financialization (LSDfi), which aims to put the liquidity offered by the LSD tokens to use in DeFi applications.\n\nRelated: LSD for DeFi: Tenet, LayerZero partner to drive cross-chain liquid staking adoption\n\nIs LSDfi the solution?\n\nLSDfi leverages the liquidity of LSD tokens into DeFi-like lending protocols and liquidity on exchanges for higher yields.

"""
REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is clear that the ETH market is currently bearish, with a downward trend in prices and a sell signal indicated by the MACD. The high gas prices and fluctuating total value transferred further support the notion of a continued downward trend. 

On the other hand, the news analyst report suggests that there is potential for a rally in Ethereum if key resistance levels are broken, leading to a price increase towards $2,000 and beyond. However, the overall market conditions, including sell-offs and concerns over a U.S. debt default, are contributing to volatility.

Reflecting on the reports, it is evident that a combination of on-chain data analysis and risk management strategies have been effective in guiding trading decisions. Long-term trends and growth opportunities based on on-chain data analysis have been more successful compared to short-term fluctuations influenced by news reports.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is advisable to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains in the ETH market. While there may be potential for a rally if key resistance levels are broken, the overall bearish trend indicated by on-chain data suggests a cautious approach is warranted.

Therefore, my trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.7, reflecting a moderate level of confidence in the bearish market trend and a strategic decision to manage risk appropriately.
ACTION:
-0.7
DAILY RETURN:
-0.0048784542330910785
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the short-term market trend for ETH is bearish due to the downward price movement, high gas prices, and the sell signal on the MACD indicator. On the other hand, the news analyst report paints a more optimistic picture for ETH, highlighting potential price breakouts, positive sentiment, and growth predictions. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of on-chain data analysis, risk management, and a focus on long-term trends for successful trading outcomes.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is clear that while short-term indicators may suggest a bearish trend, the long-term outlook for ETH appears optimistic. Therefore, it is crucial to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains in order to capitalize on potential growth opportunities in the cryptocurrency market.

Given the current market conditions and the emphasis on managing risk, I would take a moderately conservative trading approach. Therefore, I would assign a trading action of 0.5, reflecting a neutral stance with a slight bias towards a positive market trend in the long term. This decision allows for flexibility to adapt to market fluctuations while maintaining a strategic focus on long-term growth potential.

Therefore, a breakout above the overhead barrier of $1922 indicates the next significant resistance is directly at $2000 followed by $2138.\n\nIn addition, the low of the June 2nd candle stands as a important support, and therefore breakdown below it will offset the bullish thesis.\n\nWill Ethereum Price Ready to Hit $2000?\n\nThe wedge pattern breakout was a sign of a trend reversal which set the ETH price on a recovery path.

The Ethereum price analysis suggests that ETH is poised for a bullish breakout, with a potential rise to $2000 if it successfully flips the $1922 resistance into support. However, a whale selling off a large amount of Ethereum-based altcoin The Graph has caused a price correction, indicating some selling pressure in the market. Additionally, the introduction of Mr. Narco, a memetoken on the Ethereum blockchain, adds a new dynamic to the market, potentially attracting more investors.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the short-term market trend for ETH is bearish due to the downward price movement, high gas prices, and the sell signal on the MACD indicator. On the other hand, the news analyst report paints a more optimistic picture for ETH, highlighting potential price breakouts, positive sentiment, and growth predictions. The reflection analyst report emphasizes the importance of on-chain data analysis, risk management, and a focus on long-term trends for successful trading outcomes.

Considering the synthesized reports, it is clear that while short-term indicators may suggest a bearish trend, the long-term outlook for ETH appears optimistic. Therefore, it is crucial to prioritize long-term strategies over short-term gains in order to capitalize on potential growth opportunities in the cryptocurrency market.

Given the current market conditions and the emphasis on managing risk, I would take a moderately conservative trading approach. Therefore, I would assign a trading action of 0.5, reflecting a neutral stance with a slight bias towards a positive market trend in the long term. This decision allows for flexibility to adapt to market fluctuations while maintaining a strategic focus on long-term growth potential.

The on-chain analyst report indicates a bearish short-term trend for ETH, with the MACD signal on sell and potential for further price declines. On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights positive market trends, with various cryptocurrencies showing resilience and potential for growth in the near future.

In reflecting on these reports, it is important to consider the long-term strategies that have proven effective in guiding successful trading decisions. While short-term fluctuations influenced by news reports can lead to losses, a focus on long-term trends and on-chain data analysis has yielded positive outcomes. Therefore, it is crucial to prioritize a moderately conservative trading approach that capitalizes on long-term growth potential while effectively managing risk.

Taking into account the conflicting reports and the emphasis on long-term strategies, it is advisable to maintain a cautious approach in the current market environment. Despite the bearish short-term indicators for ETH, the positive long-term developments and growth opportunities in the cryptocurrency market suggest that a strategic and patient approach is warranted.

Therefore, my trading action would be to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.5, reflecting a cautious stance in light of the conflicting reports and the emphasis on long-term strategies over short-term gains. This decision aims to manage risk effectively and capitalize on potential growth opportunities in the long run.

REASONING:
Based on the on-chain analyst report, it is evident that the short-term trend for ETH is bearish, with a consistent decrease in open price and a bearish MACD signal. The market appears to be volatile, with high gas prices and fluctuating total value transferred. On the other hand, the news analyst report highlights bullish developments such as the surge in Ethereum staking activities and the growth of DeFi-focused platforms, which could potentially drive up demand and market value for ETH.

Reflecting on the reports, it is clear that a focus on long-term trends and on-chain data analysis has been more successful in guiding trading decisions compared to short-term fluctuations influenced by news reports. Effective risk management strategies are crucial in managing market volatility. Therefore, a moderately conservative trading approach that prioritizes on-chain data analysis and long-term growth potential is warranted.

The SEC identifies these “crypto asset securities” as including (but not limited to) Solana, Cardano, Polygon, Filecoin, Cosmos, The Sandbox, Decentraland, Algorand, Axie Infinity, and Coti.\n\nToday’s filing contains some of the SEC’s most explicit language to date in clarifying its judgment, but once again avoids taking on the big question: is Ethereum a security or not? If so, why is the SEC silent on it? And if not, what is it?\n\n“Crypto Asset Securities”\n\nThe SEC’s argument for designating these tokens as “crypto asset securities” is exhaustively outlined in Section VIII of the complaint (pages 85 through 123). Notable patterns emerge from the filing: the process of initial coin offerings (ICOs), vesting of tokens, allocations for the core team, and the promotion of profit generation through ownership of these tokens, are all repeated themes.\n\nBut Ethereum is not listed among these. Gensler has remained consistently vague on the question of whether Ethereum and its namesake coin count as securities. ETH is commonly held as an investment, suggesting it could be classified as a security, but it is also extensively used day-to-day as a medium of exchange across protocols, making its function more akin to cash or ACH settlement.\n\nGensler has previously suggested that “everything other than Bitcoin” in the crypto space could be seen as a security, but has notably refused to clearly state as much about Ethereum. When pressed to say the words, “I believe Ethereum is a security,” the Hon. Chair just will not do it. Gensler’s reluctance to classify Ether is curious when his SEC is so eager to claim as much for others. Why?\n\nThe Ethereum problem\n\nIt might be a simple matter of intragovernmental contention. Ethereum could potentially fall under the purview of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which regards Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether as commodities, not securities. Not only do the two categories differ wildly from one another, this overlap could create a regulatory tug-of-war that would Gensler’s public stance on Ethereum while trying to avoid the appearance of infighting within the federal government.\n\nAnother analysis from Protos, argues that Gensler’s evasion on the matter may be a consequence of the SEC’s earlier inaction following the infamous DAO hack, which saw the blockchain fork into Ethereum Classic and put the entire ecosystem at risk. However, at the time the SEC did nothing, and now Gensler finds himself in the unenviable position of making up for his predecessors’ oversights. Now that the Ethereum ecosystem has spent years recovering and building credibility, retroactively declaring it an unregistered security would have unforeseen, but no doubt disastrous, consequences for investors.\n\nIn other words, protecting investors in this case would mean protecting them from the protector.\n\nHowever, perhaps another reason could lie beneath Gensler’s reluctance to clearly classify Ethereum: he may not know.\n\nCryptocurrencies and their underlying technologies are innovative and novel. They represent a fundamental shift in how we understand finance and asset ownership, and in the case of decentralized ecosystems like Ethereum, they introduce entirely new paradigms.\n\nIf this is true, it’s not unreasonable to suspect that most people—even those deeply involved in the space—may not fully understand the implications of these innovations just yet. Anything that is fundamentally new will resist categorization, and Ethereum does so—this lack of a concrete “concept” that both defines Ethereum but fits into previous understandings is the core problem around regulating it.\n\nThis regulatory ambiguity presents a complex challenge for Ethereum, but it does not lessen the urgency to address it. The advancement of the crypto industry hinges on obtaining clear legal definitions for Layer 1 (L1) tokens, such as Ethereum, that function simultaneously as mediums of daily exchange and investment vehicles within their respective ecosystems. The ambiguity in their status poses a significant hurdle, stalling progress and fostering uncertainty in a space that is ripe for growth and innovation.\n\nThe dichotomy of these tokens’ roles blurs the boundary between conventional asset classes, forcing us to confront inadequacies in existing legal structures. To propel the crypto industry forward, regulators must acknowledge and address this nuanced reality. Until a refined framework emerges that accurately captures the dual functionality of these L1 tokens, regulatory ambiguity will continue to shroud the industry, stifling its full potential and deterring mains...'}]

Additionally, South Korea has shown a preference for trading XRP over Ethereum, indicating a unique market trend in the region. Despite Bitcoin and Ethereum experiencing declines in price, the overall market remains range-bound with a lack of clear trend control.

If you’re a crypto enthusiast, you may wonder, “Can you Buy Ethereum on Cash App?”\n\nWith its potential for smart contracts and decentralized applications, Ethereum is quickly becoming a favorite among investors and developers alike.\n\nBut with so many options out there, it can be tough to know where to start.\n\nIn this guide, we’ll take a look at how you can buy Ethereum on the Cash App in 2023 and whether it’s the right choice for you.\n\nSource: CNBC\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum and its Potential in 2023\n\nBefore we dive into the specifics of buying Ethereum on the Cash App, let’s take a look at what makes Ethereum so special and why it’s worth investing in.\n\nEthereum is a blockchain platform that allows developers to build and deploy decentralized applications, or dapps, on the blockchain. These dapps can be anything from financial applications to social networks, and they’re all built on top of Ethereum’s blockchain.\n\nOne of the most exciting things about Ethereum is its potential for smart contracts. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts, with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code.\n\nThis means that once the contract conditions are met, the contract is automatically executed. Smart contracts can potentially revolutionize many industries, from finance to real estate. In 2023, we can expect to see even more innovation in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nWith the continued growth of decentralized finance, or DeFi, investors will have more opportunities to earn passive income through lending and staking. Additionally, we can expect to see more dapps being built on Ethereum as developers continue to explore the potential of this powerful blockchain platform.\n\nCan you buy Ethereum on the Cash App in 2023?\n\nSource: Pixabay\n\nYes, you can buy Ethereum on the Cash App in 2023.\n\nCash App is a mobile payment service that allows users to send and receive money and buy and sell Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. While Cash App started as a way to send and receive money, it has since expanded to include cryptocurrency trading.\n\nTo buy Ethereum on the Cash App, you must have a Cash App account and some fiat currency in your bank account or linked debit card. From there, you can easily convert your fiat currency into Ethereum and start investing in this exciting cryptocurrency.\n\nHow to Buy Ethereum on the Cash App in 2023: A Step-by-Step Guide\n\nIf you’re new to Cash App or cryptocurrency trading, the process of buying ETH on Cash App may seem intimidating.\n\nBut don’t worry; it’s quite simple. Here’s a step-by-step guide to buying Ethereum on the Cash App in 2023:\n\nDownload the Cash App from the App Store or Google Play Store and create an account. Link your bank account or debit card to your Cash App account. Go to the “Investing” tab on the home screen and select “Cryptocurrency.” Select Ethereum from the list of available cryptocurrencies. Enter the amount of ETH you want to buy and confirm your purchase. Congratulations! You now own Ethereum on the Cash App.\n\nSetting up your Cash App account for buying Ethereum\n\nYou’ll need to set up your account before you can start buying Ethereum on the Cash App.\n\nHere are some tips for setting up your Cash App account for buying Ethereum:\n\nMake sure your account is verified. To verify your account, you must provide some personal information, including your full name, date of birth, and social security number. Link your bank account or debit card. This will allow you to convert your fiat currency into Ethereum. Enable two-factor authentication. Two-factor authentication adds extra security to your account and helps protect your funds from hackers and scammers. Familiarize yourself with the app. Take some time to explore the different features of the Cash App and get comfortable with the interface.\n\nTips for buying Ethereum on the Cash App in 2023\n\nSource: Paxful\n\nNow that you know how to buy Ethereum on the Cash App, let’s take a look at some tips for making the most of your investments:\n\nDo your research. Before you invest in any cryptocurrency, it’s important to do your research and understand the risks involved. Invest only what you can afford to lose. Cryptocurrency investing is highly volatile, and there is always the risk of losing your entire investment. Consider using dollar-cost averaging. Dollar-cost averaging is a strategy where you invest a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the asset’s price. This can help you avoid buying at the top of the market and potentially losing money. Keep your cryptocurrency in a custodial wallet. While Cash App provides a crypto wallet, keeping your investments in a separate, custodial wallet is generally safer. Stay up-to-date on the latest news and developments in the Ethereum ecosystem.

The news articles suggest a mixed sentiment towards Ethereum (ETH) in the market. On one hand, there are positive indicators such as the potential launch of the GHO stablecoin on the Aave lending protocol, VanEck's prediction of ETH reaching $11.8k by 2030, and machine learning algorithms forecasting a price increase towards the end of June. On the other hand, there are concerns raised by Jack Dorsey's controversial comments on ETH being a security, potential SEC scrutiny on Ethereum, and fluctuations in Ethereum's price due to regulatory actions against major crypto exchanges. Despite these challenges, key metrics like Ethereum's network usage data, DApps activity, and derivatives markets suggest resilience and a potential for ETH to hold above the $1.8k level. Overall, the market trend for Ethereum appears to be cautiously optimistic with a potential for price growth in the long term, but short-term volatility may be influenced by regulatory developments and market sentiment.

You are an ETH cryptocurrency trading analyst. Your analysis and action history is given in chronological order:
"""
REASONING:
After reviewing the on-chain, news, and reflection analyst reports, it is clear that there are conflicting perspectives on the current market trend for ETH. The on-chain analysis indicates a bearish trend with decreasing trading activity and prices, while the news analysis suggests a short-term bullish breakout potential with caution due to selling pressure from whales and the introduction of new tokens. The reflection report emphasizes the importance of long-term trends and on-chain data analysis in guiding trading decisions, highlighting the need for effective risk management strategies.

Considering the information provided, it is evident that a focus on long-term trends and on-chain data analysis is crucial for making informed trading decisions. While short-term fluctuations and news reports can influence market sentiment, prioritizing long-term growth potential and effective risk management strategies is key to maximizing overall profit in the cryptocurrency market.

Therefore, I would adopt a moderately conservative trading approach, placing more emphasis on on-chain data analysis and long-term growth opportunities. Given the conflicting signals in the reports and the emphasis on managing risk, I would take a cautious approach and assign a confidence level of 0.3 for the market trend. This reflects my strategic decision to prioritize long-term gains and navigate potential market fluctuations effectively.

DAILY RETURN:
-0.028722548328287578
REASONING:

The news report highlights regulatory uncertainties and market preferences favoring other cryptocurrencies over Ethereum. Additionally, the reflection report emphasizes the importance of long-term trends and effective risk management strategies in navigating market volatility.

Considering these factors, it is evident that a cautious and long-term approach is necessary in the current market environment. Short-term fluctuations influenced by news reports may not provide a reliable guide for trading decisions.

In response to a tweet asking him if he believed Ethereum (ETH) was a security, he tweeted, “Yes.”\n\nThe Twitter user raised the initial question in response to Jack’s other tweet, where he shared a screenshot of a 2015 post from Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, which suggests Coinbase should focus on Bitcoin and referred to all altcoins as “distraction.”\n\nTesla CEO and Dogecoin Evangelist Elon Musk also weighed in on the debate to promote his favorite memecoin Doge. Bitcoin Ordinals developer Udi Wertheimer lashed out against Jack and called him a “clown.”\n\nJack later accentuated his pro-Bitcoin stance by retweeting a video of Jack Mallers reprimanding Brian Armstrong’s business model for Coinbase. The online altercation comes in the wake of the SEC’s latest lawsuit against Binance and Coinbase this week.\n\nMany experts have chimed in with their thoughts on the matter. One such comment came from Pierre Rochard, vice president of research at Riot Platform, on Bitcoin maximalism.\n\nIt's understandable why some might perceive #Bitcoin maximalism as cult-like due to the community's staunch conviction in Bitcoin's potential. However, this is a misconception primarily based on misunderstanding the principles that underpin Bitcoin maximalism.

The development team seeks to attract new Web3 projects to build their communities on the platform.\n\nPolkadot Decoded chat room on Grill.chat. Source: Grill.chat\n\nThe integration means that users can now connect their Subsocial wallets to their EVM wallets by signing a transaction verifying that they are the wallet’s owner. This prevents them from needing to own SUB tokens to donate to other users, and it allows them to prove their Ethereum identities to users in chat rooms. In the future, the developers plan to use this integration to allow nonfungible token (NFT) collections to be shown to other users.\n\nIn a conversation with Cointelegraph, Subsocial content lead Zachary Edwards stated that Grill.chat is targeting crypto projects as potential sponsors of chat rooms. Currently, many crypto communities are built around Discord servers and Telegram channels. These channels cannot be integrated into the developer’s website, which means that users need to load a separate program to join the community or interact with it, creating what Edwards sees as unneeded friction for users.\n\nBy contrast, chat groups on Grill.chat can be integrated into a development team’s website or application interface. Edwards pointed to the example of Zeitgeist, a blockchain-based predictions market app. Its interface features a “chat” icon that opens directly into a Zeitgeist chat room on Grill.chat.\n\nZeitgeist user interface with Grill.chat window open. Source: Zeitgeist\n\nHowever, the app’s users previously encountered friction from another source, Edwards said. Many of the biggest crypto projects are on EVM-based networks such as Ethereum, Polygon and Avalanche. Crypto users are accustomed to using wallets from these networks and don’t necessarily want to download a new wallet to use a chat app.\n\nRelated: Decentralized social media: The next big thing in crypto?\n\nTo partially solve this problem, the team implemented a feature that lets users create a Subsocial wallet directly from the app’s interface. They also paid for users’ gas fees via a system that can delegate signing privileges for a limited number of functions.\n\nBut this still didn’t completely solve the problem, as it siloed the user’s Ethereum identity from their Grill.chat posts. The team implemented EVM compatibility to make it easier for Ethereum users to switch to the app, Edwards explained.\n\n“The cool thing is it's sort of using this off-chain signer technology because, at the end of the day, it’s all running on Substrate [Polkadot parachain technology], and EVM wallets aren’t compatible with Substrate,” Edwards stated. “But we can still connect those two accounts together so you can chat on the substrate chain, but your EVM account is linked, so you can have identity, donations, NFTs, all of this sort of stuff.”\n\nGrill.chat isn’t the only social media app trying to entice crypto projects into building communities on it. OpenChat is a chat app on the Internet Computer network. Its team told Cointelegraph it’s working on a similar feature to show OpenChat chat rooms on a project’s website.\n\nWeb3 companies are racing to create a blockchain-based social media app that will see mass adoption. On April 26, the Polygon-based Lens network announced a new scaling solution that it said would allow for “instant posts.” The same day, MeWe said it would move its 20 million users to the Polkadot parachain network Frequency."}]

Are you a member of ExampleDAO, which lives on Optimism? Then you have an account on Optimism! Are you holding a CDP in a stablecoin system on ZkSync? Then you have an account on ZkSync… The days of a user having only one address will be gone,” he said.\n\nThis must be achieved at the same time as the further development of smart contract wallets and privacy.\n\nBlockchain solutions are beginning to look more alike\n\nThese three transitions are not completely new to the blockchain ecosystem at large, and definitely not unique to Etheruem.\n\nCross-chain solutions that can help different networks communicate with one another, for example, has been explored in depth by the Cosmos ecosystem — a network of individual layer-1 app chains.\n\nIn an interview with Blockworks, Dougie DeLuca, an investor at Figment Capital, noted that rollup ecosystems are beginning to resemble Cosmos in a lot of ways.\n\n“There’s conversations right now about how blockchain design is just going to be commoditized, and they’re going to look kind of similar. This is honestly the earliest sign of this that I’ve seen, where the Cosmos has proliferated the idea of app chains. And rollups right now are moving more and more towards app specific rollups, which is similar to an app chain,” DeLuca said.\n\nCosmos layer-1 blockchains, for example, communicate with each other through an inter-blockchain communication protocol (IBC). A more Ethereum-native solution to resolving the interoperability between layer-2s would be Connext, a team building out chain abstraction.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nSimilarly, with smart contract wallets, Etheruem is designing account abstraction solutions that will enable users to have self custody over their own wallets. In Cosmos, this is currently being explored by Authz.\n\nAlthough fundamentally different, the end goal is similar.\n\n“I think it would be great for the Cosmos and rollup teams to work closely together…Ethereum has been focusing on one set of problems for a long time, and Cosmos another set. If we combine our knowledge, I think we actually have a pretty great solution that we can work towards,” DeLuca said.\n\nDon’t miss the next big story – join our free daily newsletter.'}, {'id': 5, 'time': 'Fri, 09 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "'Ethereum Fails' Without These 3 Changes, Says Vitalik Buterin - Yahoo Finance", 'content': 'If Ethereum is to expand how it\'s used, it will need to undergo three major transitions or risk undermining its own future, said Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.\n\nIn a blog post published on Friday, Buterin laid out his ideas for what it will take to help Ethereum mature if it is to expand in use. Calling them “The Three Transitions,” Buterin said they would need to evolve around transitions in layer-2, or “L2,” scaling solutions, a move to smart contract wallets, and greater privacy for fund transfers.\n\nButerin’s proposals bump into what has been called the "blockchain trilemma." A blockchain\'s most important traits are being decentralized, secure, and scalable, but it can only usually achieve two of these three.\n\nTo overcome this, Buterin said that it is acknowledged that these transitions would be challenging to coordinate, but said they were needed for Ethereum to survive.\n\nOf the three, Buterin singled out a need to expand use of L2 solutions called “rollups” as an important part of this transition. An ordinary L2 function processes transactions off of the main Ethereum blockchain, or the L1.\n\nA rollup is a scaling solution that bundles these transactions and then validates a proof of them as a much smaller piece of data on the mainnet to keep it from getting too clogged. As a result, the cost of an Ethereum transaction can be lower.\n\n"Layer 2s are critical to the success of Ethereum’s vision of the world computer. Without L2s, Ethereum won’t scale," CEO of OP Labs and co-founder of Ethereum scaler Optimism Karl Floersch told Decrypt. "Without scale, Ethereum will never be able to support the world’s compute demand, and until the world’s compute is fully supported, we can’t fully realize Ethereum’s vision."\n\nCritically, said Buterin, the version of Ethereum that does not address the move to rollups "fails," adding that transaction costs would only surge in the face of a bull run and encourage more centralization on its blockchain.\n\nStory continues\n\n"The solution isn\'t simply \'move users off of mainnet.\' Rather, the solution lies in extending the capabilities of the Ethereum network," Floersch said. "This means that instead of thinking about it as a migration from mainnet, we can think about it as load balancing the demand for Ethereum mainnet with other highly secure OP chains."\n\nBringing Ethereum from the edge\n\nEli Ben-Sasson, co-founder of the Israeli-based company StarkWare behind layer-2 scaling solutions StarkEx and StarkNet, said Buterin was “right” in his diagnosis of what it would take to see an expanded Ethereum.\n\nHe said his company was already using the smart contract wallets as part of its StarkNet, and believes more of this type of scaling is “over the horizon.”\n\n“Having the leadership from Vitalik which both appreciates the excitement of this moment and urges the community to get on board is a big part of what will propel Ethereum’s success,” Ben-Sasson told Decrypt.\n\nButerin said the move to smart contract wallets has some "technical issues" to work through but is "not a large burden" to address.\n\nWith a smart contract, contracts automatically execute their terms when predefined conditions are met, and Buterin said they would make some processes easier like covering transactions for non-ETH tokens.\n\nBinance to Delist Monero, Zcash in 4 European Countries\n\nOf the three transitions, Buterin expressed concern that meeting privacy concerns would be among the bigger challenges. He said that without enough data privacy measures in place, users concerned about this will stay away from Ethereum.\n\n“Without [privacy], Ethereum fails because having all transactions available publicly for literally anyone to see is far too high a privacy sacrifice for many users," said Buterin.\n\nTo address this, Buterin suggested using "stealth address" to help protect user identities, but these methods are still maturing because of issues around cost and functionality.'}]

Recently, in the “All Core Developers Consensus Call”, many details of the update were finalized.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Ethereum Profit Calculator\n\nDevelopers come to an agreement\n\nThe main topic of discussion was about blobs. Blobs are chunks of data that can be added to the Ethereum blockchain. An Ethereum developer named Dankrad Feist conducted an experiment to test how well the Ethereum network can handle large blocks with additional data.\n\nFeist found that the Ethereum network successfully processed blocks with 128 kB to 1 MB of extra data without causing any problems. He tested factors like bandwidth usage, block speed, and missed attestations. Everything remained stable regardless of block size.\n\nHowever, there was one instance where a block carrying 1 MB of additional data caused a temporary reorganization of the blockchain.\n\nBased on the experiment, Feist suggested making some changes. He recommended increasing the maximum number of blobs per block from 4 to 6, as specified in EIP 4844. He also suggested reevaluating the deadline for receiving blocks within a certain time frame.\n\nNext, the participants discussed making modifications to EIP-4788. This EIP allows the Beacon block root to be visible in the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine). The suggestion was to restrict the quantity of block roots stored on the EL (Execution Layer) to control the growth of the blockchain’s state.\n\nThough implementing this change would require EL clients to perform additional disk writes, everyone in the discussion agreed that it was a necessary adjustment.\n\nThe team made plans to launch a new testnet called Holesky, which will serve as an alternative platform for implementing changes to the beacon chain. The main goal of Holesky is to run a larger number of validators compared to the mainnet. This will enable them to perform stress tests and evaluate any modifications related to the Beacon chain.\n\nState of ETH\n\nThese developments could have a positive impact on the price of ETH in the future.

Discover SCENE\n\nIf Ethereum is to expand how it\'s used, it will need to undergo three major transitions or risk undermining its own future, said Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.\n\nIn a blog post published on Friday, Buterin laid out his ideas for what it will take to help Ethereum mature if it is to expand in use. Calling them “The Three Transitions,” Buterin said they would need to evolve around transitions in layer-2, or “L2,” scaling solutions, a move to smart contract wallets, and greater privacy for fund transfers.\n\nButerin’s proposals bump into what has been called the "blockchain trilemma." A blockchain\'s most important traits are being decentralized, secure, and scalable, but it can only usually achieve two of these three.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo overcome this, Buterin said that it is acknowledged that these transitions would be challenging to coordinate, but said they were needed for Ethereum to survive.\n\nOf the three, Buterin singled out a need to expand use of L2 solutions called “rollups” as an important part of this transition. An ordinary L2 function processes transactions off of the main Ethereum blockchain, or the L1.\n\nA rollup is a scaling solution that bundles these transactions and then validates a proof of them as a much smaller piece of data on the mainnet to keep it from getting too clogged. As a result, the cost of an Ethereum transaction can be lower.\n\n"Layer 2s are critical to the success of Ethereum’s vision of the world computer. Without L2s, Ethereum won’t scale," CEO of OP Labs and co-founder of Ethereum scaler Optimism Karl Floersch told Decrypt. "Without scale, Ethereum will never be able to support the world’s compute demand, and until the world’s compute is fully supported, we can’t fully realize Ethereum’s vision."\n\nCritically, said Buterin, the version of Ethereum that does not address the move to rollups "fails," adding that transaction costs would only surge in the face of a bull run and encourage more centralization on its blockchain.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n"The solution isn\'t simply \'move users off of mainnet.\' Rather, the solution lies in extending the capabilities of the Ethereum network," Floersch said. "This means that instead of thinking about it as a migration from mainnet, we can think about it as load balancing the demand for Ethereum mainnet with other highly secure OP chains."\n\nBringing Ethereum from the edge\n\nEli Ben-Sasson, co-founder of the Israeli-based company StarkWare behind layer-2 scaling solutions StarkEx and StarkNet, said Buterin was “right” in his diagnosis of what it would take to see an expanded Ethereum.\n\nHe said his company was already using the smart contract wallets as part of its StarkNet, and believes more of this type of scaling is “over the horizon.”\n\n“Having the leadership from Vitalik which both appreciates the excitement of this moment and urges the community to get on board is a big part of what will propel Ethereum’s success,” Ben-Sasson told Decrypt.\n\nButerin said the move to smart contract wallets has some "technical issues" to work through but is "not a large burden" to address.\n\nWith a smart contract, contracts automatically execute their terms when predefined conditions are met, and Buterin said they would make some processes easier like covering transactions for non-ETH tokens.\n\nOf the three transitions, Buterin expressed concern that meeting privacy concerns would be among the bigger challenges. He said that without enough data privacy measures in place, users concerned about this will stay away from Ethereum.\n\n“Without [privacy], Ethereum fails because having all transactions available publicly for literally anyone to see is far too high a privacy sacrifice for many users," said Buterin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo address this, Buterin suggested using "stealth address" to help protect user identities, but these methods are still maturing because of issues around cost and functionality.'}]

Although ETH’s dominance in the smart contract space has been unwavering, liquidation in the crypto market arm reached $11 million.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 ETHs worth today?\n\nAccording to Parsec Finance’s data, this liquidation was the highest recorded since 12 May. However, market participants might need to exercise more caution as DefiLlama data shed light on potential threats.\n\nDeFi: Wary of the possibilities\n\nAt the time of writing, the multi-chain DeFi aggregator showed that the total liquidatable assets amounted to $1.7 billion. This metric describes the overall worth of DeFi assets with open futures or contract positions which could suffer losses depending on the market direction.\n\nBased on DefiLlamas’ data, most of the liquidation in the last 24 hours occurred via the MakerDAO [MKR] protocol. However, there were several open staked Ether [stETH] and Wrapped Bitcoin [WBTC] positions at risk of suffering the same fate.\n\nSo, this could prompt market participants to carefully evaluate the risks involved with their sentiment.\n\nOver the last 24 hours, it has not been rosy for the broader crypto market. For instance, ETH’s value decreased by 5.93%. DeFi tokens like Arbitrum [ARB] and Lido Finance [LDO] lost 12.49% and 18.16% respectively.\n\nWith the falling prices, DefiLlama revealed that another 20% aggregate decrease in value could take another $161 million out of the market.\n\nAlthough 20% might seem like a lot, the press time market state does not take away the possibility. This is because more than half of the cryptocurrencies in the top 50 by market capitalization have experienced double-digit decreases in the last 24 hours.\n\nTVL in the drain\n\nInterestingly, the Total Value Locked (TVL) has not been exempt from the widespread gloomy picture of the market. Out of almost 200 chains in the sector, only one—zkSync Era—recorded growth in the last 24 hours.\n\nAs an indicator of whether a DeFi asset is undervalued or overvalued, the TVL measures the worth of tokens temporarily deposited into a protocol.\n\nRealistic or not, here’s MKR’s market cap in LDO’s terms\n\nEthereum, which has the highest TVL of $25.28 billion, lost 4.36% of smart contract deposits within the said period. Thus, the decrease implies that liquidity has been hoarded and flown out of the ecosystem by investors. So, Ethereum might not be performing at its highest capacity.\n\nUnder the Ethereum blockchain, Lido Finance continues to lead the pact with a TVL of $12.65 billion. Other projects, including MakerDAO, Curve Finance [CRV], and Aave [AAVE], trailed behind.'}, {'id': 32, 'time': 'Sun, 11 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Are Avorak AI and Ethereum The Safest Investments For 2023? - Analytics Insight', 'content': 'Every investment demands careful consideration, foresight, and a comprehensive evaluation of the potential risks and rewards.

According to forecasts, the first quarter of 2023 was expected to be weak, potentially leading to further losses. However, contrary to expectations, the first three months of 2023 saw crypto assets recover.\n\nDuring this period, bitcoin dominated, surpassing the $22,000 resistance level in January and recording a 36% increase. However, it is essential to note that Bitcoin still faces notable challenges that require attention. Despite initial expectations, Bitcoin has yet to transform into a widespread global payment system as anticipated.\n\nWhile Bitcoin has merits, alternatives like Ethereum and DigiToads are worth considering.\n\nEthereum, renowned for its smart contract capabilities and diverse ecosystem, has experienced an upward trajectory this year. For investors contemplating how to enter the crypto market, Ethereum can present an enticing option due to its distinct features and potential.\n\nOn the other hand, DigiToads, a meme coin project with utility, has disrupted the world of digital collectibles with immersive gaming experiences.

Regardless of their performance in the game, 10% of the collected funds are airdropped to token holders.\n\nFurthermore, a staking mechanism is available to generate passive income. Participants must purchase and stake non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to receive rewards.\n\nThe DigiToads token is also deflationary. Long-term investors may find it appealing that the system incorporates built-in token-burning mechanisms. As the supply decreases, the value of the tokens could increase.\n\nInvestors and gamers are supporting the project. DigiToads has already raised over $4.7 million in its ongoing presale, with the token price rising from $0.01 to $0.036.

Source: Vitalik Buterin’s website\n\nIn addition to wallets securing crypto assets, Buterin explained that wallets would need to secure data in order to truly transition into an on-chain world with zero-knowledge rollups:\n\n“In a ZK world, however, this is no longer true: the wallet is not just protecting authentication credentials, it\'s also holding your data.”\n\nThe last of Buterin’s three transitions — privacy — will need to come in the form of improved identity, reputation and social recovery systems.\n\n“Without the third, Ethereum fails because having all transactions (and POAPs, etc) available publicly for literally anyone to see is far too high a privacy sacrifice for many users, and everyone moves onto centralized solutions that at least somewhat hide your data,” he said.\n\nThe Ethereum co-founder suggested that stealth addresses could be implemented to resolve this issue.\n\nRelated: Vitalik Buterin reveals 3 ‘huge’ opportunities for crypto in 2023\n\nButerin said that achieving all three will be “challenging” because of the “intense coordination” involved between them.\n\nHe admitted that each of the three transitions “weaken” the “one user — one address” model, which, in turn, may complicate the way transactions are executed.\n\n“If you want to pay someone, how will you get the information on how to pay them?”\n\n“If users have many assets stored in different places across different chains, how do they do key changes and social recovery?" he added.\n\nButerin concluded by stressing the need to build infrastructure that ultimately improvers user experience:\n\n“Despite the challenges, achieving scalability, wallet security, and privacy for regular users is crucial for Ethereum\'s future. It is not just about technical feasibility but about actual accessibility for regular users. We need to rise to meet this challenge.”\n\nMagazine: ZK-rollups are ‘the endgame’ for scaling blockchains, Polygon Miden founder'}, {'id': 30, 'time': 'Mon, 12 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Crypto Price Today: Bitcoin falls below $25,900; BNB, Shiba Inu shed up to 5% - The Economic Times', 'content': '\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cryptocurrency markets were trading mixed on Monday ahead of key inflation data later in the day.

This may sound good, but it poses significant risks to the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nLido Staking Risks Exposed\n\nLido provides liquid staking services for Ethereum as an alternative to self-staking, which is highly technical, and involves exchanges that take substantial commissions.\n\nIt has rapidly become the market leader with 7.18 million staked ETH, or 36% of the total 19.6 million staked.\n\nOn June 13, Ethereum advocates at ‘Bankless’ sounded the alarm on Lido, calling for the prevention of its domination of ETH staking.\n\nA continued SEC crackdown on exchanges is likely to push more staked Ethereum to Lido, it noted.

For a full disclaimer, please click here.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market remains prone to extreme bearishness after the SEC sued Binance and Coinbase for illegal operation and sale of unregistered securities, while also labelling a select number of major coins are securities.\n\nDespite Ethereum not being explicitly named in the lawsuit, it has received an enormous brunt of the negative outlook. The token has fallen over 6% in the past week as pre-FOMC fears also make matters worse.\n\nAs ETH and other major tokens struggle, Investors are already flocking to new tokens not targeted by the SEC that can offer better immediate prospects. Let’s take a look at Ethereum’s chances of recovering from the crash and which new tokens traders are backing to defy the bear market.\n\nEthereum Price Prediction Remains Bearish for June\n\nThe security versus commodity debate has now become the overarching narrative of the crypto market. In its lawsuit, the SEC labelled several major altcoins such as Cardano, Solana and MATIC as unregistered securities. These tokens plummeted by as much as 30% following the filing.\n\nOn the surface, the SEC’s lawsuit could have been beneficial for Ethereum. Both the Solana and Cardano communities have not shied away from calling themselves “Ethereum Killers”, and both blockchains are designed to replace Ethereum as the leading platform for smart contract technology. Thus, a bearish outlook for ADA and SOL could have been bullish for Ether.\n\nAs it turns out, Ethereum may soon find itself on the SEC’s target as well. SEC chairman Gary Gensler has said multiple times that Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that he is comfortable deeming a commodity. In a tense exchange with Representative Patrick McHenry during his congressional hearing, Gensler hesitated in clarifying whether ETH is a security or not.\n\nSeveral other key figures have taken a strong stance against Ether as well. New York Attorney General Letitia James sued KuCoin for offering the sale of ETH, which she labelled as an unregistered security.\n\nThe token may soon face a double whammy as the Federal Reserve is set to decide on a major interest rate hike next week. Several key officials including Fed chair Jerome Powell have taken an uncompromising stance in their fight against soaring inflation levels. If the Fed indeed proceeds with another interest rate hike, ETH prices could take another major hit.\n\nA recent report by CoinShares highlighted that Ethereum-based assets saw outflows totalling $36 million in just the last week. The report believes that most of the outflows are a result of the Fed’s unending hawkish monetary policy.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain also needs significant improvements to ensure long-term user retention. In his blog, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin explained that the blockchain will simply die without three key transitions of scalability, privacy and wallet security. Buterin’s biggest fear is that with ETH transactions costing a lot of fees, users will simply move to other options like Solana and Cardano. While these blockchains are more centralised than Ethereum, they are also significantly faster.\n\nTradingView, a technical analysis platform, gives a sell signal to the token in the daily time frame. With ETH underperforming 12 of the 15 most important moving average indicators, its price prediction remains bearish for June.\n\nWhich Tokens are Outperforming the Beark Market?\n\nDespite the struggles of major tokens several new tokens are providing hope to traders.\n\nTwo of these include Wall Street Memes and Ecoterra, both of which are sailing through their respective presales.\n\nWall Street Memes Token Raises $6.5 Million in Bid to Be the Next Big Meme Coin\n\nThe Wall Street Memes token has become one of the hottest commodities in the meme coin market. Investors are losing confidence in tokens such as Pepe and Doge due to their inability to perform in the bear market. But the $WSM token has become one of the most consistent performers as it has raised over $6.5 million in less than 3 weeks.\n\nThe token is a result of the same community spirit that inspired the historic GameStop short squeeze in 2021. In fact, the Wall Street Memes group considers it its mission to disrupt the traditional financial landscape. The group also has a strong track record in the crypto space as well. It sold out its Wall St Bulls NFT collection in 32 minutes, netting a cool $2.5 million. It has also recently announced its own Bitcoin ordinal NFTs.\n\nThe group is not resting on its laurels as the Wall Street Memes token has adopted community-driven tokenomics. The entire $WSM supply is available to the general public, with no cuts for any private sales. 50% of the tokens are available during the presale itsel..."}, {'id': 21, 'time': 'Tue, 13 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "SEC officials pushed Hinman to clarify ETH wasn't a security: Court docs - Blockworks", 'content': 'The SEC released hundreds of documents, including emails and notes, after a judge ordered the documents to be unsealed as part of the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the securities regulator.\n\nThe highly-anticipated documents related to a June 2018 speech from former SEC Division Director William Hinman were released on Tuesday, June 13.\n\nThe documents show how Hinman’s speech — which clarified that the SEC didn’t believe that ether was a security at the time — evolved prior to the SEC targeting XRP as a security.\n\nIn his speech, Hinman said, “And putting aside the fundraising that accompanied the creation of Ether, based on my understanding of the present state of ether, the Ethereum network and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of ether are not securities transactions.”\n\nThe released documents show conversations between SEC employees at the time — including the trading and markets department’s comments — and Hinman.\n\nIn an email, Hinman said the language around ether “would be used if we all are in agreement. We also have a call with [Vitalik] Buterin later this week to confirm our understanding of how the Ethereum Foundation operates.”\n\nBrett Redfearn, the director of trading and markets at the time, told Hinman via email his original language on ETH and whether it was a security remained “vague.” Redfearn suggested that Hinman use “stronger” language.\n\nGoogle Document comments show an unnamed editor saying, “As we discussed, as written, referring to the sentiment within this section of the speech. We think the relevant question as discussed throughout the rest of the speech is whether a digital asset meets the legal standards of a security, not whether it warrants regulation as a security.”\n\nThe comments also show the SEC saying that “we do not want to suggest that BTC is a security.”\n\nAn additional comment left on the document says:\n\n“We thought you were going to say that you don’t believe ETH is a security. We think that is a helpful message. This statement, on the other hand, appears likely to create more confusion about the status of ETH. To the extent you don’t say ETH is not a security, please consider confirming the policy rationale to the disclosure regime of the federal securities laws, as you did with respect to Bitcoin earlier in the paragraph.”\n\nEmployees also noted that they had “reservations” about including a direct statement on ether in the speech because “it seems that it would be difficult for the agency to take a different position on ether in the future. Further, the rest of the paragraph strongly implies the thinking applies to ether.”\n\n“Without the sentence about ether, those implications might generate a useful reaction about ether (from purchasers or those in the FinTech space). With the sentence, the reaction seems less likely to focus on the analysis, and more likely to focus on the potential fallout of making a direct statement about ether’s status as a security.”\n\nIn another comment, SEC officials acknowledged that “the fact that tokens on a sufficiently decentralized network are no longer securities — and no longer are required to register with all the benefits to investors of registration — seems to point out what might be considered a “regulatory gap” that exists in this space.”\n\n“In other words, this speech acknowledges that there is an “other” category,” the comments said. “It’s not a security because there’s no “controlling group” (at least in the Howey sense) yet, like many other things (medication, credit cards) there may be a need for regulation to protect purchasers.”\n\nKnown conflicts of interest\n\nA first batch of emails between Hinman and Shira Pavis Minton, the designated agency ethics official at the SEC, was released in April 2022 after Empower Oversight, a nonprofit whistleblower organization, successfully filed a Freedom of Information Act request.\n\nMinton warned Hinman that he is not to engage in any SEC matters that could impact law firm Simpson Thacher, where he worked before the SEC, due to his financial interest in the firm. He was also advised not to meet with anyone from Simpson Thacher.\n\nHinman met with Josh Bonnie, a partner at Simpson Thacher, several times after being warned about the conflict of interest, Empower Oversight said in an April 2022 statement. The former SEC director also met with the co-founders of and investors in Ethereum ahead of the speech he gave in 2018 declaring ether a token, not a security.\n\nThe April 2022 email release suggested that Hinman and the SEC had an interest in promoting and protecting ether over other, similar tokens. If this were found to be true, it would be a significant win for Ripple.\n\nShortly after these documents revealed the agency may have acted inconsistently with their classification of crypto tokens, a judge ruled that the SEC would not be able to edit or clarify any of the content in the emails ahead of the XRP case, which had already been underway for over a year when the f...'}]

First, the Ethereum protocol continues to move in this direction and will particularly do so with its next upgrade, including proto-danksharding, which expands Ethereum’s data availability capabilities. Moreover, not only is the base layer itself improving, but so, too, are the layer 2s, with improved decentralization and new paradigms around interconnectivity and shared security ahead. And these base and secondary layer improvements will come together to enable new use cases and functionality, creating a virtuous cycle. Portended by rising ecosystem transaction counts, Ethereum is perhaps on its way to becoming the world’s settlement layer.'}, {'id': 8, 'time': 'Wed, 14 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': "Ethereum Can Reach $50000 in 2030? Let's Find Out - Watcher Guru", 'content': 'Ethereum (ETH) surpassing Bitcoin (BTC) as the largest crypto ecosystem, has been a major topic of debate over the past few years. The event is sometimes dubbed “the flippening.” However, regardless of ETH becoming the number one crypto, a report by VanEck said that the token could reach $50,000 in 2030. In the first six months of 2023, ETH has risen by around 45%, which is quite impressive. BTC, on the other hand, has increased by as much as 57%.\n\nVanEck’s valuation method is based on a number of fundamental components. The first part is Ethereum’s business model, which mainly depends on transaction fees. The second part is the ETH coin supply, which falls over time and supports the crypto’s price to increase. Additionally, the third part is what VanEck referred to as the “broad market capture strategy.” In essence, it means that Ethereum is currently involved in almost everything blockchain-related.\n\nCan Ethereum realistically reach $50k?\n\nETH is one of the most development-heavy blockchain projects in the industry. This is a fundamental metric for future growth. Although rival networks have appeared, none are as significant as ETH. Moreover, the recent pressure from regulators has greatly affected rival networks like Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Polygon (MATIC). All three were named by the U.S. SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) in its suit against Coinbase. However, Ethereum (ETH) was said to not be a security. This keeps ETH at a fairly safe distance from the recent chaos.\n\nAdditionally, ETH has a lot of room to grow. The difference between the largest and second-largest crypto projects is massive, and the gap could be lessened in the future. Moreover, ETH has a lot more use cases than BTC. Therefore, it could see even greater adoption in the years to come. In fact, the “flippening” might very well happen within a few years. Therefore, VanEck’s forecast of ETH reaching $50k by 2030, seems very possible. At press time, ETH was trading at $1,745.50, down 0.5% in the last 24 hours.'}, {'id': 11, 'time': 'Wed, 14 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'The Graph ditches Ethereum, migrates to Arbitrum in anticipated move - Blockworks', 'content': 'The Graph, a blockchain indexing protocol founded in 2018, is fully migrating to the Arbitrum network from Ethereum on Wednesday.\n\nThe Graph’s move to the popular layer-2 was initiated by network participants in an attempt to lower gas fees, accelerate transactions, and increase the protocol’s accessibility, according to a press release from The Graph Foundation.\n\nEdge & Node CEO Tegan Kline said users weighed the options among layer-2 networks and Arbitrum ultimately came out on top.\n\n“The Graph users have continually searched for solutions to improve gas efficiencies and enhance other aspects of the network,” Kline said in a statement. “After careful consideration of all options on the market, the ecosystem selected Arbitrum as the Layer 2 scaling solution that will bring speed and affordability to protocol developers and network participants.”\n\nThis has been long in the making, with plans to move being known as far back as April 2022 via a governance proposal that suggested creating a set of contracts that would bridge GRT transactions to Arbitrum. Discussions about moving to a layer-2 network because of prohibitively expensive gas prices date back to November 2021 on The Graph’s forums.\n\nA June 2022 proposal was the first to present a deployment of The Graph on Arbitrum. Its proposers, Edge & Node software engineers Pablo Carranza Vélez and Ariel Barmat, suggested it wasn’t a good idea to migrate in “one go.”\n\nSince then, The Graph has gradually taken more steps to exit the Ethereum network, including enabling indexing rewards on Arbitrum and deploying transfer tools enabling users to move tokens to Arbitrum. Both proposals were passed unanimously.\n\nThe statement from The Graph Foundation further explained that its users should start receiving transition prompts today.\n\n“Protocol users will be presented with an option to transition to Arbitrum across The Graph’s suite of products.

Discover SCENE\n\nIf you’re on the hunt for a casual, free-to-play mobile game that pays you cryptocurrency along the way, Ethereum Blast might do the trick.\n\nWhile I wouldn’t go so far as to say I had a “blast” playing through the simplistic color-matching puzzle stages, it’s a decently fun diversion that can put a little bit of Ethereum or Bitcoin into your wallet while you play.\n\nBling Financial’s free iOS and Android game is a simple color-matching puzzle game with a vibe that’s best described as “sci-fi meets Ethereum.” All that really means is that you’ll see the familiar Ethereum symbol floating around the menus and interface here and there, and people who aren’t crypto die-hards shouldn’t be turned off by that modest window dressing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEthereum Blast is a straightforward puzzler, tasking you with tapping two or more connected, like-colored stones to clear them from the board. As you clear stones, new ones fall from above to fill the space and potentially sets up larger matches that can earn you power-ups in the process. Each level provides certain targets of stones or items to clear within a limited number of moves.\n\nScreenshots from Ethereum Blast on iOS. Image: Decrypt\n\nIt’s all easy to grasp and control, with simple taps used to clear blocks or activate power-ups. But it’s also largely unchallenging and mostly mindless, and you'll earn plenty of power-ups to get you out of any binds. I played through nearly 50 stages and only lost once along the way. But as a simple on-the-go distraction, it’s pleasant enough—much like Tetro Tiles, another mobile puzzler with crypto rewards.\n\nHow much can you reasonably earn by playing? Your mileage may vary, but I earned about $0.20 worth of crypto in about two hours of play. Bling’s games reward you with Bling points that you can then convert into Ethereum or Bitcoin, and then cash out to a Coinbase or PayPal account. I cashed out in ETH, but it would’ve been the same USD value in Bitcoin too.\n\nIt’s not much—but it’s more than I earned playing Bling’s Bitcoin Solitaire, which earned me about $0.09 worth of Bitcoin in a two-hour span. However, your earning potential in Ethereum Blast diminishes the more you play, as the amount of Bling points offered for playing each stage appears to dwindle over time. The game may not hold your interest for long anyway.\n\nAnd to be clear, the amount of ads you’ll watch to earn even pennies’ worth of crypto is pretty overwhelming. You’ll face a full-screen video ad after nearly each completed level, and these typically last for a minute or more before you’re able to tap your way out of them. Given how short the levels are, that means you’ll spend about as much time playing as watching ads.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIs that worth it to make about $0.10 per hour? Honestly, I’d rather spend my time playing a more engaging mobile puzzler without crypto rewards—like Threes or Grindstone, or my on-and-off guilty pleasure, Candy Crush Saga. But if you’re intent on “stacking sats” or eking out ETH while playing games, Ethereum Blast is a solid option."}, {'id': 3, 'time': 'Wed, 14 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT', 'title': 'Just How Realistic Is a $50,000 Price Target for Ethereum? - The Motley Fool', 'content': 'Through the first six months of 2023, Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) has been one of the top-performing cryptocurrencies, up more than 45% year to date. It now trades around $1,745, after briefly breaking through the $2,000 level earlier this year. However, Ethereum is still down by nearly 65% from its all-time high of $4,891.70.\n\nGiven Ethereum\'s performance this year, some investors are now recalibrating and putting more aggressive price targets on the token. Most recently, New York-based investment firm VanEck put out a head-spinning $50,000 price target for Ethereum by 2030. Given Ethereum\'s current price, that implies a more than 25x return. But just how realistic is that?\n\nThe bullish scenario for Ethereum\n\nVanEck\'s valuation model is based on several key building blocks, so this is not the sort of pie-in-the-sky price target that is so commonly promoted by super-bullish crypto enthusiasts. The first building block is Ethereum\'s revenue model, which relies primarily on transaction fees. The second building block is Ethereum\'s coin supply, which is actually decreasing over time, helping to prop up the crypto\'s price. And the third building block is what VanEck calls the "broad market capture strategy" of Ethereum. Basically, this means that Ethereum is involved in just about everything blockchain-related these days.\n\nFor each of these building blocks, it is then possible to construct a base, bear, and bull case scenario. For the bullish scenarios to take place, Ethereum needs to remain the market leader in every niche of the blockchain sector, such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), while also broadening the number of real-world applications in which it is used in areas such as finance, banking, and payments. This is what a broad market-capture strategy would look like for the next seven years.\n\nTransaction volume and growth forecasts\n\nWhen it was founded back in 2015, Ethereum had a clear first-mover advantage. At that time, it had no legitimate Layer 1 blockchain rivals. But now, Ethereum must contend with the likes of Solana, Avalanche, and Cardano. And each of these Layer 1 blockchain rivals will continue to chip away at Ethereum\'s transaction volume. This makes it highly unlikely that Ethereum will hit the revenue targets in the bull case scenario. Right now, VanEck is projecting that transaction fees (i.e., revenue) will explode by more than 50x between now and 2030.\n\nThat doesn\'t seem likely, given that Ethereum continues to rely on a patchwork system of Layer 2 blockchains (which sit on top of its main blockchain) to process all of those transactions. VanEck views this Layer 2 ecosystem as a positive for Ethereum, and seems to suggest that the transaction fees generated on these blockchains should be factored into the overall revenue mix of Ethereum.\n\nBut I\'m not so convinced that this Layer 2 blockchain activity should be seen as a sign of strength. From my perspective, they are just further proof that Ethereum is having a hard time going one-on-one with its rival Layer 1 blockchains, which are still much faster and much cheaper to use. Ethereum is most likely years away from reaching its peak transaction-processing capabilities.\n\nCan Ethereum reach $50,000?\n\nGiven all of the above, VanEck appears to be too aggressive in its growth assumptions for Ethereum. For example, VanEck currently projects revenue for the category "metaverse, social, and gaming" to balloon by 50x in its bull case scenario. Counting on massive growth in this category seems flawed given that the metaverse investment thesis has completely imploded over the past 18 months.\n\nAnd not taking into account all the potential for its Layer 1 rivals to chip away at its dominance seems short-sighted to me. Plus, it\'s important to keep in mind regulatory risk. If the Securities and Exchange Commission ever rules that Ethereum is a security, that would pose a huge risk to Ethereum\'s business model.\n\nSimply put, a $50,000 price forecast just seems too aggressive. Remember: the all-time high for Ethereum is under $5,000, and Ethereum has already shown real weakness this year when it comes to pushing past the $2,000 mark. That being said, I\'m still bullish on Ethereum both in the short term and the long term. It is a highly diversified crypto with exposure to every sector of the blockchain world. But I am readjusting my own expectations about Ethereum to keep them as realistic as possible.'}]
